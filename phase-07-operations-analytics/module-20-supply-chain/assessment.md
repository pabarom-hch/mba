## Answer Key

### Section 1: Supply Chain Strategy

**Q1:** b) Responsive supply chain
*Explanation: Innovative products with unpredictable demand require flexibility, speed, and the ability to respond quickly to market changes.*

**Q2:**
a) Strategic misalignment: Using an efficient supply chain design (long lead times, centralized) for products that need responsiveness (short life cycles, unpredictable demand). By the time products arrive, trends may have changed.

b) Recommendations:
- Move manufacturing closer (nearshore or regional) to reduce lead times
- Implement postponement (delay final customization until closer to demand)
- Use air freight for fast-moving items
- Adopt quick-response systems with smaller, more frequent shipments

**Q3:**
Push-pull boundary: The point where production shifts from forecast-driven (push) to demand-driven (pull).

Dell example:
- Traditional PC makers: Full push - complete PCs built to forecast, stored in inventory
- Dell original model: Push-pull boundary at component level
  - Push: Components manufactured and shipped to Dell (forecast-driven)
  - Pull: Final assembly triggered by customer order (demand-driven)
  - Result: Faster response, less obsolescence, lower inventory

**Q4:**
Centralized (one low-cost location):
- Advantages: Economies of scale, lower labor costs
- Disadvantages: Long lead times, higher transportation, concentrated risk

Regional facilities:
- Advantages: Faster delivery, local responsiveness, risk diversification
- Disadvantages: Higher total cost, complexity, smaller scale per facility

### Section 2: Procurement

**Q5:**
| Item | Classification | Strategy |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Office supplies | Non-critical | Simplify, automate, reduce transactions |
| Custom ASIC chips | Strategic | Long-term partnership, joint development |
| Cardboard packaging | Leverage | Competitive bidding, volume leverage |
| Specialty coating | Bottleneck | Secure supply, develop alternatives |

**Q6:**
Supplier A (Domestic):
- Purchase: 50,000 × $15.00 = $750,000
- Freight: 50,000 × $0.50 = $25,000
- Defects: 50,000 × 0.5% × $100 = $25,000
- **Total TCO: $800,000**

Supplier B (Offshore):
- Purchase: 50,000 × $12.00 = $600,000
- Freight: 50,000 × $2.00 = $100,000
- Defects: 50,000 × 2.0% × $100 = $100,000
- **Total TCO: $800,000**

Despite $3 lower unit price, Supplier B has same total cost after freight and quality costs.

**Q7:**
- Single-sourcing: Deliberately choosing to use one supplier when alternatives exist
- Sole-sourcing: Only one supplier is available (no choice)

Reasons for deliberate single-sourcing:
- Build stronger relationship and commitment
- Achieve economies of scale with higher volume
- Enable joint development and innovation
- Simplify management
- When supplier invests in dedicated capacity

**Q8:**
Weighted score = 0.30(4) + 0.25(3) + 0.20(4) + 0.15(5) + 0.10(3)
= 1.20 + 0.75 + 0.80 + 0.75 + 0.30 = **3.80**

Score of 3.80 = "Acceptable" (typically 3.5-3.9 range)
Action: Maintain supplier with improvement plan, especially targeting delivery performance (lowest weighted contribution).

### Section 3: Inventory Management

**Q9:**
a) EOQ = √(2DS/H) = √(2 × 20,000 × 100 / 4) = √1,000,000 = **1,000 units**

b) Orders per year = D/EOQ = 20,000/1,000 = **20 orders**

c) Daily demand = 20,000/250 = 80 units
   ROP = Daily demand × Lead time = 80 × 5 = **400 units**
   (Note: 1 week = 5 working days)

d) Annual ordering cost = (D/Q) × S = (20,000/1,000) × 100 = $2,000
   Annual holding cost = (Q/2) × H = (1,000/2) × 4 = $2,000
   **Total = $4,000**

**Q10:**
a) σ_L = σ_d × √L = 30 × √4 = 30 × 2 = **60 units**

b) Safety stock = z × σ_L = 1.65 × 60 = **99 units**

c) ROP = (d × L) + SS = (150 × 4) + 99 = 600 + 99 = **699 units**

**Q11:**
| SKU | Annual Demand | Unit Cost | Annual Value | Rank | Class |
|-----|---------------|-----------|--------------|------|-------|
| 103 | 100 | $800 | $80,000 | 1 | A |
| 101 | 500 | $200 | $100,000 | 1 | A |
| 105 | 300 | $100 | $30,000 | 3 | B |
| 102 | 2,000 | $10 | $20,000 | 4 | B |
| 104 | 5,000 | $3 | $15,000 | 5 | C |

Total value: $245,000
- A items (101, 103): $180,000 (73%) - 40% of items
- B items (102, 105): $50,000 (20%) - 40% of items
- C items (104): $15,000 (6%) - 20% of items

**Q12:**
Safety stock follows the z-value, which increases at a decreasing rate but service level is on a non-linear scale.

% increase = (2.33 - 1.65) / 1.65 = 0.68 / 1.65 = **41% increase** in safety stock

Going from 95% to 99% service level requires approximately 41% more safety stock.

**Q13:**
a) Average inventory = COGS / Turnover = $12M / 6 = **$2 million**

b) Days of inventory = 365 / Turnover = 365 / 6 = **61 days**

### Section 4: Logistics

**Q14:**
- Air → C (High-value, time-critical, light goods)
- Ocean → D (International, high volume, cost-sensitive)
- Rail → A (Bulk commodities, long distance, low urgency)
- Truck (FTL) → B (Regional distribution, moderate volume)

**Q15:**
3PL advantageous:
- Variable/seasonal demand (convert fixed to variable cost)
- Rapid geographic expansion needed
- Specialized capabilities required (cold chain, hazmat)
- Logistics is not a core competency

In-house fleet better:
- Logistics is competitive advantage (delivery experience)
- Stable, predictable volume
- Highly specialized requirements
- Need maximum control over customer experience

**Q16:**
a) Failed deliveries = 10,000 × 20% = **2,000**

b) Re-delivery cost = 2,000 × $10 = **$20,000**
   (Note: Original failed deliveries still cost $8 each = $16,000 already spent)

c) Cancellations = 2,000 × 10% = 200 orders
   Lost revenue = 200 × $45 = **$9,000**

d) Total impact = Re-delivery ($20,000) + Lost revenue ($9,000) = **$29,000/month**

**Q17:**
Cross-docking: Products flow through a facility with minimal storage time, sorted and shipped same day. Goods move from inbound to outbound docks without put-away.

Conditions for effectiveness:
- High, predictable demand
- Pre-labeled products
- Reliable inbound shipments (timing)
- Good information systems
- Physical facility design (adequate docks)
- Supplier compliance with requirements

### Section 5: Demand Planning

**Q18:**
a) 3-period SMA = (110 + 130 + 140) / 3 = 380 / 3 = **126.7**

b) Exponential smoothing with α=0.3:
F1 = 100
F2 = 0.3(100) + 0.7(100) = 100
F3 = 0.3(120) + 0.7(100) = 106
F4 = 0.3(110) + 0.7(106) = 107.2
F5 = 0.3(130) + 0.7(107.2) = 114.0
F6 = 0.3(140) + 0.7(114.0) = **121.8**

**Q19:**
a) Interpretation:
- MAPE of 25% indicates moderate accuracy (acceptable for variable demand products)
- Positive bias of +15% means forecasts are consistently too high
- Company is likely overproducing/overstocking

b) Actions to improve:
- Adjust forecasts downward systematically (correct bias)
- Implement better demand sensing (closer to actual orders)
- Incorporate sales intelligence more effectively
- Use different forecasting method or combine methods

**Q20:**
Purpose: S&OP aligns the organization around a single demand and supply plan, balancing sales goals with operational capabilities, and connecting operational plans to financial targets.

Key participants:
- CEO/General Manager (chair)
- Sales/Commercial
- Marketing
- Operations/Supply Chain
- Finance
- Product Development/Engineering

**Q21:**
Aggregate forecasts are more accurate because:
- Individual SKU errors cancel out (+/-)
- Law of large numbers
- Randomness averages out across products

Practical application:
- Forecast at aggregate level (family, category)
- Disaggregate using historical ratios or current trends
- Hold safety stock based on disaggregation uncertainty
- Plan capacity at aggregate, fulfill at detail

### Section 6: Supply Chain Risk

**Q22:**
a) Key supplier bankruptcy → **Supply risk**
b) Hurricane damages DC → **Environmental risk**
c) 50% demand increase → **Demand risk**
d) Port strike → **Network risk**
e) Equipment failure → **Operational risk**

**Q23:**
a) Risk score = 3 × 5 × 4 = **60** (out of 125 max = 48% priority score)

b) Mitigation strategies:
- Dual sourcing: Qualify second supplier, split volume 70/30
- Geographic diversification: Find supplier in different region
- Strategic inventory: Hold 4-6 weeks of safety stock
- Supplier development: Work with supplier on risk reduction
- Contractual protection: Require supplier BCP, audit regularly

**Q24:**
| Aspect | Efficiency Focus | Resilience Focus |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Inventory | Minimal, JIT | Safety stock, buffers |
| Sourcing | Single/low-cost | Multi-source, diverse |
| Facilities | Centralized | Distributed, redundant |

**Q25:**
a) Immediate (48 hours):
- Activate crisis team
- Assess inventory position and in-transit goods
- Contact alternative suppliers
- Communicate with key customers
- Implement order allocation if needed

b) Short-term (weeks 1-2):
- Expedite from alternative sources
- Transfer production to other facilities if possible
- Prioritize customer orders by importance
- Implement customer communication plan
- Assess insurance and financial impact

c) Recovery (weeks 3-6):
- Ramp up alternative supply
- Begin facility repair/rebuild
- Gradually restore normal operations
- Rebuild depleted inventory
- Conduct lessons learned review

**Q26:**
Bullwhip effect: Demand variability amplification as you move upstream in supply chain. Small changes in consumer demand become large swings at supplier levels.

Causes:
- Demand signal processing (forecasting amplifies changes)
- Order batching (periodic ordering creates lumps)
- Price fluctuations (promotions cause forward buying)
- Rationing/shortage gaming (over-ordering when supply tight)

Reduction strategies:
- Information sharing: Share POS data with suppliers
- Collaborative forecasting (CPFR)
- Everyday low pricing (reduce promotion-driven buying)
- Vendor-managed inventory (VMI)
- Smaller, more frequent orders
