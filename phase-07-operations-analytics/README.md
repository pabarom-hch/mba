# Phase 7: Operations & Analytics

## Overview

Operations and analytics form the backbone of business execution. While strategy determines where to compete, operations determines how well you compete. This phase covers the design and management of operational systems, the application of data analytics to business decisions, and the optimization of supply chains for competitive advantage.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you will be able to:

1. Design and optimize operational processes
2. Apply quality management and continuous improvement methodologies
3. Use data analytics for business decision-making
4. Design and manage end-to-end supply chains
5. Balance efficiency with flexibility in operations
6. Apply predictive and prescriptive analytics
7. Manage operations in service and manufacturing contexts

## The Operations Imperative

```
WHY OPERATIONS MATTERS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Operations can be a source of sustainable advantage:
• Cost leadership through efficiency
• Quality differentiation
• Speed and responsiveness
• Flexibility and customization
• Reliability and consistency

THE OPERATIONS-STRATEGY CONNECTION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Strategy              Operations Implication
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cost Leadership   →   Process efficiency, scale, automation
Differentiation   →   Flexibility, quality, customization
Speed             →   Process design, inventory positioning
Reliability       →   Quality systems, capacity buffers

OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
           Quality
              │
    Speed ────┼──── Flexibility
              │
         ────┼────
        │         │
     Cost    Dependability

Trade-offs exist; strategy determines priorities
```

## The Analytics Evolution

```
ANALYTICS MATURITY MODEL:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Level 4: PRESCRIPTIVE
        "What should we do?"
        Optimization, simulation, AI/ML
             ▲
Level 3: PREDICTIVE
        "What will happen?"
        Forecasting, machine learning
             ▲
Level 2: DIAGNOSTIC
        "Why did it happen?"
        Root cause analysis, drill-down
             ▲
Level 1: DESCRIPTIVE
        "What happened?"
        Reports, dashboards, KPIs

BUSINESS VALUE INCREASES WITH MATURITY:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Descriptive: Operational efficiency
• Diagnostic: Problem solving
• Predictive: Proactive decision-making
• Prescriptive: Optimized outcomes
