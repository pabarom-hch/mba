## Introduction

The accounting equation is the foundation of all financial reporting. Every transaction, every financial statement, every ratio analysis traces back to this simple equation. Understanding it deeply is the first step to financial literacy.

```
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity
```

This isn't just a formula—it's a statement about how business resources are funded and who has claims on them.

## Core Concepts

### The Accounting Equation

**The Equation:**
```
ASSETS = LIABILITIES + SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

What the company OWNS = What the company OWES + What belongs to OWNERS
```

**Alternative Views:**
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Assets - Liabilities = Equity (Net worth)

Sources of funds = Uses of funds
```

**Components Defined:**

| Component | Definition | Examples |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Assets** | Resources controlled by the company expected to provide future economic benefit | Cash, receivables, inventory, equipment, patents |
| **Liabilities** | Obligations to transfer resources to others | Accounts payable, loans, bonds, deferred revenue |
| **Equity** | Residual interest after liabilities | Common stock, retained earnings, APIC |

### Why the Equation Always Balances

Every transaction affects at least two accounts, keeping the equation balanced.

**Transaction Examples:**

| Transaction | Asset Change | Liability Change | Equity Change |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| Issue stock for $100 | +$100 Cash | - | +$100 Equity |
| Borrow $50 | +$50 Cash | +$50 Debt | - |
| Buy equipment for cash | +Equipment, -Cash | - | - |
| Make credit sale | +Receivable | - | +Revenue (Equity) |
| Pay expenses in cash | -Cash | - | -Expense (Equity) |

### Double-Entry Bookkeeping

**The Rule:** Every transaction affects at least two accounts.

**Debit and Credit:**

| Account Type | Debit (Left) | Credit (Right) |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Assets | Increase | Decrease |
| Liabilities | Decrease | Increase |
| Equity | Decrease | Increase |
| Revenue | Decrease | Increase |
| Expenses | Increase | Decrease |

**Memory Device:**
- DEAL: Debits increase Expenses, Assets, Losses
- CRIL: Credits increase Revenue, Income, Liabilities (and Equity)

**Example Journal Entry:**
```
Company sells product for $1,000 on credit:

Debit:  Accounts Receivable    $1,000 (Asset increases)
Credit: Revenue                $1,000 (Equity increases via income)

Equation check:
Assets (+$1,000) = Liabilities (0) + Equity (+$1,000) ✓
```

### Expanded Accounting Equation

To show how income flows to equity:

```
Assets = Liabilities + Contributed Capital + Retained Earnings

Where:
Retained Earnings = Beginning RE + Net Income - Dividends
Net Income = Revenues - Expenses
```

**Full Expanded Form:**
```
Assets = Liabilities + Contributed Capital + Beginning RE + Revenues - Expenses - Dividends
```

## GAAP Principles

### Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

GAAP provides the framework for financial reporting. Key principles:

**1. Economic Entity Assumption**
- Business is separate from owners
- Personal and business transactions don't mix
- Each subsidiary may be treated separately

**2. Going Concern Assumption**
- Assume business will continue operating
- Assets valued at cost, not liquidation value
- If going concern is doubtful, disclose

**3. Monetary Unit Assumption**
- All transactions recorded in stable currency
- No adjustment for inflation (mostly)
- Enables aggregation and comparison

**4. Time Period Assumption**
- Activity can be divided into discrete periods
- Enables quarterly/annual reporting
- Some transactions span periods (require allocation)

**5. Revenue Recognition Principle**
- Recognize revenue when earned (not when cash received)
- Under ASC 606: When performance obligation satisfied
- Critical for understanding accrual accounting

**6. Expense Recognition (Matching) Principle**
- Match expenses to revenues they help generate
- Depreciation spreads equipment cost over useful life
- Accrued expenses recognized when incurred

**7. Full Disclosure Principle**
- Report all information that could affect decisions
- Financial statements + notes + MD&A
- Material items must be disclosed

**8. Cost Principle (Historical Cost)**
- Record assets at acquisition cost
- Some exceptions (fair value accounting for investments)
- Reliability vs. relevance trade-off

**9. Materiality**
- Only items significant enough to affect decisions need precise treatment
- Immaterial items can be expensed immediately
- Judgment required

**10. Conservatism (Prudence)**
- When in doubt, choose option that understates assets/income
- Anticipate losses, don't anticipate gains
- "Losses recognized immediately, gains when realized"

### Accrual vs. Cash Accounting

**Cash Basis:**
- Record revenue when cash received
- Record expenses when cash paid
- Simple but doesn't match economic reality

**Accrual Basis:**
- Record revenue when earned
- Record expenses when incurred
- Required under GAAP for most businesses

**Example Comparison:**

| Event | Cash Basis | Accrual Basis |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Dec: Perform service, bill $1,000 | No revenue | $1,000 revenue |
| Jan: Receive payment | $1,000 revenue | No additional revenue |
| Dec: Receive $500 for future work | $500 revenue | $500 deferred revenue (liability) |
| Jan: Perform the work | No revenue | $500 revenue |

**Why Accrual Matters:**
```
Company A (Cash Basis):
December: $0 revenue, $50K expenses = -$50K loss
January: $200K revenue, $50K expenses = $150K profit

Company A (Accrual Basis):
December: $100K earned, $50K expenses = $50K profit
January: $100K earned, $50K expenses = $50K profit

Accrual shows steady business; cash shows volatility that isn't real.
```

## Consulting Application

### Transaction Analysis Framework

When analyzing any business transaction:

1. **Identify accounts affected**
   - What assets, liabilities, or equity items change?

2. **Determine direction**
   - Increases or decreases?

3. **Verify equation balance**
   - Does A still equal L + E?

4. **Consider timing**
   - When should this be recognized?

### Due Diligence Application

When evaluating a company:

**Check Accounting Equation Health:**
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

$100M = $60M + $40M ✓

If totals don't match, errors exist
If equity is negative, company may be insolvent
```

**Assess Equity Quality:**
- How much is contributed capital vs. retained earnings?
- Are retained earnings real or from accounting maneuvers?
- Any significant accumulated other comprehensive income?

## CEO Application

### Using the Equation for Strategic Insight

**Leverage Analysis:**
```
Debt-to-Equity = Liabilities / Equity

High ratio = more financial risk
Low ratio = potentially underleveraged
Industry norms vary significantly
```

**Asset Efficiency:**
```
Are assets generating adequate returns?
ROA = Net Income / Assets
ROE = Net Income / Equity
```

**Funding Sources:**
```
How is growth funded?
- Debt (Liabilities increase)
- Equity issuance (Contributed capital increase)
- Internal generation (Retained earnings increase)
```

### Questions to Ask Your CFO

1. "What's our debt-to-equity ratio trend, and how does it compare to peers?"
2. "How much of our equity is from earnings vs. stock issuance?"
3. "Are there any off-balance-sheet liabilities I should know about?"
4. "What accounting policy changes have we made, and why?"

## Worked Example

### Transaction Walkthrough

TechStart Inc. has the following transactions in January:

1. **Jan 1:** Issue 10,000 shares at $10/share
2. **Jan 5:** Borrow $50,000 from bank
3. **Jan 10:** Purchase equipment for $30,000 cash
4. **Jan 15:** Purchase inventory for $20,000 on credit
5. **Jan 20:** Sell inventory (cost $8,000) for $15,000 on credit
6. **Jan 25:** Pay $10,000 on accounts payable
7. **Jan 31:** Receive $12,000 from customers
8. **Jan 31:** Pay $5,000 in wages

**Starting Position:** A = L + E = 0 = 0 + 0

**Transaction Analysis:**

| # | Transaction | Assets | Liabilities | Equity |
|---|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Issue stock | +$100K Cash | - | +$100K Stock |
| 2 | Borrow | +$50K Cash | +$50K Debt | - |
| 3 | Buy equipment | -$30K Cash, +$30K Equip | - | - |
| 4 | Buy inventory | +$20K Inventory | +$20K AP | - |
| 5 | Sale | +$15K AR, -$8K Inv | - | +$15K Rev, -$8K COGS |
| 6 | Pay AP | -$10K Cash | -$10K AP | - |
| 7 | Collect AR | +$12K Cash, -$12K AR | - | - |
| 8 | Pay wages | -$5K Cash | - | -$5K Expense |

**Ending Position:**

| Assets | Amount | Liabilities | Amount | Equity | Amount |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Cash | $117K | Debt | $50K | Common Stock | $100K |
| A/R | $3K | A/P | $10K | Retained Earnings | $2K |
| Inventory | $12K | | | | |
| Equipment | $30K | | | | |
| **Total** | **$162K** | **Total** | **$60K** | **Total** | **$102K** |

**Check:** $162K = $60K + $102K ✓

**Net Income Calculation:**
Revenue $15K - COGS $8K - Wages $5K = $2K Net Income

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Confusing Cash and Profit
**Mistake:** Assuming positive cash flow means profitability.
**Reality:** You can have profits with no cash (all in receivables) or cash with no profits (from borrowing).

### 2. Ignoring Accruals
**Mistake:** Thinking cash paid = expense.
**Reality:** Expenses are recognized when incurred, which may differ from cash payment.

### 3. Equity as "Free Money"
**Mistake:** Viewing equity as costless since no interest.
**Reality:** Equity has cost (expected returns to shareholders), often higher than debt.

### 4. Forgetting the Balance
**Mistake:** Adjusting one account without considering others.
**Reality:** Every transaction affects at least two accounts.

### 5. Mixing Personal and Business
**Mistake:** Running personal expenses through business.
**Reality:** Violates economic entity assumption; creates legal and tax issues.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The equation must always balance** - Assets = Liabilities + Equity
2. **Every transaction affects two accounts** - Double-entry is fundamental
3. **Accrual accounting matches economics** - Revenue when earned, expenses when incurred
4. **GAAP provides the rules** - Consistency enables comparison
5. **Equity is residual** - What's left after liabilities
6. **Conservatism dominates** - When uncertain, understate assets/income
7. **Understand the flow** - Income flows to retained earnings flows to equity
