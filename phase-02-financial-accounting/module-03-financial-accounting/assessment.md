## Answer Key

### Section A

**Q1:** Assets = Liabilities + Equity
$500M = Liabilities + $200M
Liabilities = $300M

**Q2:**
- Cash accounting: Recognizes revenue when cash received, expenses when cash paid
- Accrual accounting: Recognizes revenue when earned, expenses when incurred
- GAAP requires accrual because it better matches economic reality and provides more useful information about future cash flows. Revenue and expenses are recorded when the economic event occurs, not when cash changes hands.

**Q3:** Net income is based on accrual accounting while OCF measures actual cash. Differences arise from:
1. Non-cash expenses: Depreciation reduces net income but no cash outflow
2. Working capital changes: Selling on credit creates revenue without cash; buying inventory uses cash without expense

**Q4:**
- Capitalize: Record as asset on balance sheet, expense gradually (depreciation/amortization)
  - Balance sheet: Asset increases
  - Income statement: No immediate expense; depreciation expense over time
- Expense: Record full amount in current income statement
  - Balance sheet: No asset created (or cash decreases)
  - Income statement: Full expense in current period

**Q5:** Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over fair value of net identifiable assets in an acquisition. It represents expected synergies, brand value, workforce, etc. It only arises in acquisitions because GAAP doesn't allow capitalizing internally-developed intangibles like brand value—those costs are expensed as incurred (R&D, marketing, etc.).

### Section B

**Q6:** Balance Sheet:

| Assets | | Liabilities & Equity | |
|--------|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Cash | $135,000 | Bank Loan | $50,000 |
| Receivables | $5,000 | Equity: | |
| Inventory | ($12,000) | Common Stock | $100,000 |
| Equipment | $30,000 | Retained Earnings | $8,000 |
| **Total Assets** | **$158,000** | **Total L&E** | **$158,000** |

Calculations:
- Cash: +100K (stock) +50K (loan) -30K (equipment) +15K (collections) = 135K
- Receivables: 20K sale - 15K collected = 5K
- Retained Earnings: 20K revenue - 12K COGS = 8K profit

**Q7:**
a) Gross margin = ($1,000,000 - $600,000) / $1,000,000 = 40%
b) Operating income = $1,000,000 - $600,000 - $150,000 - $50,000 = $200,000
c) EBT = $200,000 - $30,000 = $170,000
   Net income = $170,000 × (1 - 0.25) = $127,500

**Q8:**
Operating Activities: Cash from core business
- Examples: Cash from customers, payments to suppliers, wages paid, interest paid

Investing Activities: Cash for long-term investments
- Examples: Capital expenditures, acquisitions, sale of equipment, purchase of investments

Financing Activities: Cash from/to capital providers
- Examples: Debt issuance/repayment, stock issuance/buyback, dividends paid

**Q9:**
```
Operating Cash Flow:
Net Income                   $80M
+ Depreciation               $20M
- Increase in Receivables   ($15M)
- Increase in Inventory     ($10M)
+ Increase in Payables       $8M
= Operating Cash Flow       $83M

Free Cash Flow:
OCF                         $83M
- CapEx                    ($35M)
= Free Cash Flow           $48M
```

**Q10:** ASC 606 Five Steps:
1. Identify the contract
2. Identify performance obligations
3. Determine transaction price
4. Allocate price to obligations
5. Recognize when obligations satisfied

Over time recognition: When customer receives/consumes benefit simultaneously, company creates customer-controlled asset, or asset has no alternative use and company has right to payment.

Point in time: When control transfers at a specific moment (usually delivery).

### Section C

**Q11:**
In rising prices:
a) Higher net income: FIFO (older, lower costs to COGS)
b) Lower taxes: LIFO (newer, higher costs to COGS = lower taxable income)
c) Higher inventory: FIFO (ending inventory at newer, higher costs)

**Q12:**
a) Straight-line:
Annual = ($100,000 - $10,000) / 10 = $9,000
Year 1: $9,000, Year 2: $9,000

b) Double-declining balance:
Rate = 2 × (1/10) = 20%
Year 1: $100,000 × 20% = $20,000
Year 2: ($100,000 - $20,000) × 20% = $16,000

**Q13:**
Deferred Tax Liability (DTL): Taxes to be paid in future
- Example: Accelerated tax depreciation. Book depreciation $10K, tax depreciation $15K. Paid less tax now, will pay more later.

Deferred Tax Asset (DTA): Tax benefits to receive in future
- Example: Bad debt allowance. Book expense $5K (allowance), tax expense $0 (can't deduct until written off). Will get tax benefit when actually written off.

### Section D

**Q14:**
a) Net margin = $40M / $500M = 8%
b) ROA = $40M / $400M = 10%
c) ROE = $40M / $200M = 20%
d) Current ratio = $150M / $100M = 1.5x
e) Debt-to-equity = $150M / $200M = 0.75x

**Q15:**
DuPont: ROE = Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier

Equity Multiplier = Assets/Equity = $200M/$100M = 2.0x

ROE = 8% × 1.5 × 2.0 = 24%

Interpretation: Company achieves 24% ROE through moderate profitability (8% margin), good asset efficiency (1.5x turnover), and significant leverage (2x multiplier). The leverage is amplifying returns—if business deteriorates, it would also amplify losses.

**Q16:**
a) DSO:
Year 1: ($10M / $100M) × 365 = 36.5 days
Year 2: ($18M / $120M) × 365 = 54.8 days

b) Concerns: Receivables growing 80% while revenue grew only 20%. DSO increased by 18+ days—a significant deterioration in collection.

c) Questions for management:
- Have credit terms changed?
- Are there any customer disputes or collection issues?
- Is there channel stuffing (pushing product to distributors)?
- What's the aging of receivables?
- Any related-party receivables?

**Q17:** Three red flags:

1. **OCF significantly lower than Net Income**: Indicates earnings not backed by cash—could be aggressive revenue recognition, capitalizing expenses, or working capital buildup that isn't sustainable.

2. **Receivables growing faster than revenue**: May indicate channel stuffing, extended payment terms to boost sales, or collection problems. Revenue may not be real.

3. **Frequent "one-time" charges**: If restructuring or impairment charges occur every year, they're not one-time. Management may be burying recurring costs in special charges to inflate "adjusted" earnings.

### Section E

**Q18:**
Earnings Quality Assessment:

**Concerns:**

1. **Cash Flow Gap**: OCF ($25M) is only 50% of Net Income ($50M). This is a major red flag—earnings aren't backed by cash.

2. **Stock Compensation**: $15M of the gap is stock comp (non-cash), but that still leaves $10M unexplained. Stock comp is real cost to shareholders (dilution).

3. **Receivables Growth**: Growing 30% vs. 15% revenue growth is concerning. DSO is increasing—are they stuffing the channel or having collection issues?

4. **Goodwill Concentration**: Goodwill at 60% of equity means the company has made acquisitions and paid significant premiums. If acquisitions don't perform, major impairment risk.

**Overall Assessment**: Low quality earnings. Would NOT proceed with acquisition without understanding:
- Why is cash flow so low relative to earnings?
- What's driving receivables growth?
- Are past acquisitions delivering expected returns?
- What's the risk of goodwill impairment?

**Q19:** Five Monthly Metrics:

1. **Revenue and Revenue Growth**: Top-line performance and trajectory. Shows demand for products/services and whether business is growing or shrinking.

2. **Gross Margin**: Pricing power and production efficiency. Changes signal competitive pressure or cost issues before they hit bottom line.

3. **Operating Cash Flow**: Cash generation from operations. Validates that profit is translating to cash. Early warning of working capital issues.

4. **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**: Collection efficiency. Increases signal customer problems or aggressive sales practices.

5. **Net Debt and Debt/EBITDA**: Leverage and debt capacity. Ensures company maintains financial flexibility and covenant compliance.
