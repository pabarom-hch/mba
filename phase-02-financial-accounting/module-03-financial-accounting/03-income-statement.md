## Introduction

The income statement shows a company's financial performance over a period—how much revenue it earned, what expenses it incurred, and what profit (or loss) resulted. It's the scorecard that tells you whether the business is making money.

For CEOs, the income statement reveals whether strategy is translating to financial results. Every line matters.

### Revenue

**Components:**
- Gross Revenue: Total billings
- Less: Returns, allowances, discounts
- Net Revenue (Net Sales): What company actually keeps

**Revenue Recognition (ASC 606):**
Five-step process:
1. Identify the contract
2. Identify performance obligations
3. Determine transaction price
4. Allocate price to obligations
5. Recognize when/as obligations satisfied

**Key Question:** When is revenue "earned"?
- Product sales: Usually upon delivery
- Services: When service performed
- Subscriptions: Ratably over period
- Long-term contracts: Over time or at completion

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

**What's Included:**
- Direct materials
- Direct labor
- Manufacturing overhead allocated to products
- Freight-in costs
- Inventory write-downs

**What's NOT Included:**
- Selling expenses
- General administrative costs
- R&D (except certain software development)

**Gross Profit:**
```
Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
Gross Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue
```

### Operating Expenses

**Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A):**
- Sales commissions
- Marketing and advertising
- Executive salaries
- Rent and utilities (non-manufacturing)
- Professional fees
- Office supplies

**Research & Development:**
- Generally expensed as incurred (US GAAP)
- Some software development capitalized
- IFRS allows more capitalization

**Depreciation & Amortization:**
- May be included in COGS (manufacturing equipment)
- May be in SG&A (office equipment)
- May be separate line item

### Profitability Metrics

**Gross Profit and Margin:**
```
Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
Gross Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue × 100%
```
Measures: Pricing power, production efficiency

**Operating Income (EBIT):**
```
Operating Income = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue × 100%
```
Measures: Core business profitability

**EBITDA:**
```
EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortization
EBITDA Margin = EBITDA / Revenue × 100%
```
Measures: Cash-generating ability (proxy)

**Net Income:**
```
Net Income = EBT - Income Taxes
Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue × 100%
```
Measures: Bottom-line profitability

**Earnings Per Share:**
```
Basic EPS = Net Income / Weighted Average Shares
Diluted EPS = Net Income / (Shares + Dilutive Securities)
```

### Income Statement Quality Issues

**Revenue Quality:**
- Channel stuffing (shipping excess to distributors)
- Bill-and-hold (recording before delivery)
- Related-party transactions
- Unusual quarter-end spikes

**Expense Quality:**
- Capitalizing vs. expensing
- Under-reserving (allowances, warranties)
- One-time vs. recurring charges
- Restructuring charge timing

## Income Statement Analysis

### Trend Analysis

**Year-over-Year Growth:**
```
Revenue Growth = (Revenue_t - Revenue_t-1) / Revenue_t-1 × 100%
```

**Key Trends to Monitor:**
- Revenue growth (vs. industry, economy)
- Margin trends (expanding or compressing)
- Expense growth vs. revenue growth
- Operating leverage effects

### Common-Size Analysis

Express each line as percentage of revenue:

| Line Item | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
|-----------|------|------|------|
| Revenue | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| COGS | 60% | 58% | 57% |
| Gross Margin | 40% | 42% | 43% |
| SG&A | 20% | 19% | 18% |
| Operating Margin | 15% | 18% | 20% |

**Insight:** Margins compressing—COGS and SG&A both rising as % of revenue.

### Operating Leverage

**Concept:** Fixed costs create leverage in operating income.

```
High Fixed Costs:
Revenue +10% → Operating Income +30%
Revenue -10% → Operating Income -30%

Low Fixed Costs:
Revenue +10% → Operating Income +12%
Revenue -10% → Operating Income -12%
```

**Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL):**
```
DOL = % Change in Operating Income / % Change in Revenue
```

### Segment Analysis

Large companies report by segment:
- Different revenue streams
- Different margins
- Different growth rates

**Always examine segment details** - Overall numbers can hide important trends.

## Consulting Application

### Profitability Diagnosis

**Margin Waterfall Analysis:**

```
Revenue                           100.0%
- COGS                           (60.0%)
= Gross Margin                    40.0%   ← Pricing/production
- SG&A                           (15.0%)
- R&D                             (5.0%)
= Operating Margin                20.0%   ← Operating efficiency
- Interest                        (2.0%)
= Pre-tax Margin                  18.0%
- Tax                             (4.0%)
= Net Margin                      14.0%   ← Bottom line
```

**Benchmarking Questions:**
1. How does gross margin compare to competitors?
2. Is SG&A scaling with revenue?
3. Is R&D investment adequate?
4. How does operating margin compare to peers?

### Revenue Quality Assessment

| Factor | High Quality | Low Quality |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Growth source | Core business | Acquisitions |
| Customer concentration | Diversified | Top 3 customers > 50% |
| Revenue recognition | Conservative | Aggressive |
| Quarter pattern | Consistent | Back-end loaded |
| Backlog | Growing | Declining |

### Expense Analysis

| Factor | Positive Sign | Warning Sign |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| COGS trend | Declining % of revenue | Rising % of revenue |
| SG&A | Scaling with revenue | Growing faster than revenue |
| R&D | Consistent investment | Cutting R&D |
| One-time charges | Rare | Frequent "one-time" items |

## CEO Application

### Key Performance Indicators

**Revenue KPIs:**
- Revenue growth rate
- Organic vs. acquired growth
- Revenue per employee
- Revenue by geography/segment

**Margin KPIs:**
- Gross margin trend
- Operating margin trend
- Contribution margin by product
- EBITDA margin

**Quality KPIs:**
- Days sales outstanding
- Revenue concentration
- Backlog/bookings growth
- Deferred revenue growth

### Strategic Implications

**Margin Expansion Strategies:**

| Strategy | Impact | Implementation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Price increases | ↑ Gross margin | Requires pricing power |
| Cost reduction | ↑ Gross margin | Supply chain, operations |
| SG&A leverage | ↑ Operating margin | Scale fixed costs |
| Mix shift | ↑ All margins | Higher-margin products/services |

**Questions for Management:**
1. "Why is gross margin changing? Price, cost, or mix?"
2. "Is SG&A spending supporting growth?"
3. "What's driving revenue—new customers, existing customers, price?"
4. "What's our customer lifetime value vs. acquisition cost?"

### Earnings Quality

**Sustainable vs. Unsustainable Earnings:**

| Sustainable | Unsustainable |
|-------------|---------------|
| Core revenue growth | One-time gains |
| Margin expansion from efficiency | Margin from cost cuts that can't continue |
| Lower tax from operations | Tax benefits expiring |
| Consistent profitability | Volatile, unpredictable results |

## Worked Example

### Income Statement Analysis: TechCorp

**TechCorp Income Statement ($ millions):**

| Line Item | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
|-----------|------|------|------|
| Revenue | $1,000 | $900 | $800 |
| COGS | ($550) | ($477) | ($400) |
| **Gross Profit** | **$450** | **$423** | **$400** |
| SG&A | ($200) | ($180) | ($160) |
| R&D | ($80) | ($90) | ($80) |
| **Operating Income** | **$170** | **$153** | **$160** |
| Interest Expense | ($20) | ($18) | ($15) |
| **Pre-tax Income** | **$150** | **$135** | **$145** |
| Tax | ($38) | ($34) | ($36) |
| **Net Income** | **$112** | **$101** | **$109** |

**Growth Analysis:**
```
Revenue Growth 2024: ($1,000 - $900) / $900 = 11.1%
Revenue Growth 2023: ($900 - $800) / $800 = 12.5%
```
Observation: Revenue growth slowing slightly.

**Margin Analysis:**

| Margin | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|-------|
| Gross | 45.0% | 47.0% | 50.0% | ↓ Declining |
| Operating | 17.0% | 17.0% | 20.0% | ↓ Then stable |
| Net | 11.2% | 11.2% | 13.6% | ↓ Then stable |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Gross margin compression** (50% → 45%):
   - COGS growing faster than revenue
   - Price pressure or input cost increases
   - Mix shift to lower-margin products?

2. **Operating margin stabilization**:
   - Despite gross margin decline, operating stable
   - R&D cut in 2024 ($90M → $80M) helped
   - SG&A scaling well

3. **Questions to ask:**
   - Why is gross margin declining?
   - Is the R&D cut strategic or cost-cutting desperation?
   - Is revenue growth sustainable without R&D investment?

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Focusing Only on Net Income
**Mistake:** Looking only at the bottom line.
**Reality:** Understanding WHERE profitability comes from matters more.

### 2. Ignoring Non-Cash Charges
**Mistake:** Not adjusting for depreciation, stock compensation.
**Reality:** Cash flow and earnings differ; both matter.

### 3. Missing One-Time Items
**Mistake:** Projecting from periods with unusual items.
**Reality:** Normalize for non-recurring items.

### 4. Revenue Myopia
**Mistake:** Celebrating revenue growth without margin analysis.
**Reality:** Profitable growth > unprofitable growth.

### 5. Single Period Analysis
**Mistake:** Drawing conclusions from one quarter/year.
**Reality:** Trends over multiple periods reveal more.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Revenue recognition is critical** - When revenue is earned matters enormously
2. **Gross margin reveals pricing power** - Core indicator of competitive position
3. **Operating margin shows efficiency** - Management of costs relative to revenue
4. **Multiple margins matter** - Each tells a different story
5. **Trends trump absolutes** - Direction more important than level
6. **Quality varies** - Not all earnings are equally sustainable
7. **Segments reveal truth** - Consolidated numbers can hide issues

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Margin Calculation
A company has:
- Revenue: $500M
- COGS: $300M
- SG&A: $75M
- R&D: $50M
- Interest: $10M
- Tax rate: 25%

Calculate: Gross margin, Operating margin, EBITDA (assuming $20M D&A in COGS, $5M in SG&A), Net margin.

### Problem 2: Revenue Analysis
Quarter-end revenue patterns:
- Q1: $80M, Q2: $90M, Q3: $85M, Q4: $145M

Total annual: $400M. What concerns might you have about revenue quality?

### Problem 3: Operating Leverage
Company A has: Fixed costs $50M, Variable costs 40% of revenue
Company B has: Fixed costs $20M, Variable costs 60% of revenue

Both have $100M revenue. Calculate operating income for each. If revenue increases 20%, what happens to operating income?
