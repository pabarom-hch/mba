## Introduction

Fixed assets (Property, Plant, and Equipment—PP&E) represent the long-term infrastructure of a business. The decision to capitalize vs. expense, and the choice of depreciation method, significantly affects reported profits. For capital-intensive businesses, getting this right is essential.

## Core Concepts

### Capitalization vs. Expensing

**Capitalize When:**
- Asset has useful life > 1 year
- Cost exceeds materiality threshold
- Provides future economic benefit
- Cost can be reliably measured

**Expense When:**
- Useful life < 1 year
- Repairs and maintenance (not improvements)
- Below materiality threshold

**Impact on Financial Statements:**

| Treatment | Year 1 Income | Future Income | Balance Sheet |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Capitalize | Higher | Lower (depreciation) | Higher assets |
| Expense | Lower | Unaffected | Lower assets |

### What Gets Capitalized

**Included in Asset Cost:**
- Purchase price
- Sales tax
- Shipping and handling
- Installation costs
- Site preparation
- Testing costs
- Professional fees (legal, architectural)

**Not Capitalized:**
- Interest during use (only during construction)
- Operating costs
- Maintenance and repairs
- Training costs (usually)

### Depreciation Methods

**Straight-Line:**
```
Annual Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life

Example:
Cost: $100,000
Salvage: $10,000
Life: 10 years
Annual Depreciation: ($100,000 - $10,000) / 10 = $9,000
```

**Double-Declining Balance (Accelerated):**
```
Annual Depreciation = 2 × (1/Life) × Book Value

Year 1: 2 × (1/10) × $100,000 = $20,000
Year 2: 2 × (1/10) × $80,000 = $16,000
Year 3: 2 × (1/10) × $64,000 = $12,800
...
```

**Units of Production:**
```
Depreciation per Unit = (Cost - Salvage) / Total Expected Units

Annual Depreciation = Units Produced × Depreciation per Unit
```

**Comparison:**

| Year | Straight-Line | DDB | Impact |
|------|---------------|-----|--------|
| 1 | $9,000 | $20,000 | DDB = lower early income |
| 5 | $9,000 | $7,373 | Converging |
| 10 | $9,000 | $3,436 | DDB = higher late income |
| Total | $90,000 | $90,000 | Same total |

### Useful Life and Salvage Value

**Estimates Required:**
- Useful life: How long will asset be used?
- Salvage value: What's it worth at end of life?

**These Are Judgments:**
- Longer life = lower annual depreciation = higher income
- Higher salvage = lower depreciable base = higher income
- Management has discretion (within reason)

### Asset Impairment

**When to Test:**
- Triggering events (market decline, physical damage, obsolescence)
- Annual testing for goodwill and indefinite-life intangibles

**Impairment Test:**
```
If Carrying Value > Recoverable Amount → Impairment

Recoverable Amount = Higher of:
- Fair value less costs to sell
- Value in use (present value of future cash flows)
```

**Impairment Entry:**
```
Debit: Impairment Loss (Income Statement)
Credit: Accumulated Depreciation or Asset
```

## Fixed Asset Analysis

### Key Metrics

**PP&E Turnover:**
```
PP&E Turnover = Revenue / Average Net PP&E

Higher = more efficient use of fixed assets
```

**Capital Intensity:**
```
Capital Intensity = Net PP&E / Revenue

Higher = more capital required per dollar of revenue
```

**Average Age of Assets:**
```
Average Age = Accumulated Depreciation / Depreciation Expense

or

Average Age = Accumulated Depreciation / Gross PP&E × Average Life
```

**Capital Maintenance Ratio:**
```
CapEx / Depreciation

> 1.0 = Investing more than wearing out
= 1.0 = Maintaining asset base
< 1.0 = Assets aging, underinvesting
```

### Asset Quality Assessment

**Healthy Indicators:**
- CapEx/Depreciation consistently > 1.0
- Stable or improving PP&E turnover
- Regular asset refreshment
- Minimal impairments

**Warning Signs:**
- CapEx cuts below depreciation
- Aging asset base
- Frequent impairment charges
- Declining PP&E turnover
- Capitalization policy changes

## Consulting Application

### CapEx Analysis Framework

**Maintenance vs. Growth CapEx:**

| Type | Purpose | Expected Return |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Maintenance | Keep operations running | Sustain current performance |
| Growth | Expand capacity, new products | Generate additional returns |

**Due Diligence Questions:**
1. What portion is maintenance vs. growth?
2. What's the backlog of deferred maintenance?
3. What's the age profile of assets?
4. What major capital projects are planned?
5. What's the expected return on capital projects?

### Asset Valuation

**Book Value vs. Market Value:**
- Book value = Cost - Accumulated Depreciation
- May not reflect current market value
- Real estate often undervalued on books
- Equipment may be worthless despite book value

**Replacement Cost:**
- What would it cost to replace assets today?
- Important for acquisition analysis
- Insurance purposes

## CEO Application

### Capital Allocation

**CapEx Decision Framework:**

| Question | Consideration |
|----------|--------------|
| Is it necessary? | Maintenance vs. discretionary |
| What's the return? | IRR, NPV, payback |
| How does it compare? | To other investment options |
| Can we afford it? | Cash flow, debt capacity |
| What's the risk? | Technology, execution, demand |

### Managing Depreciation Policy

**Policy Choices Affect:**
- Reported earnings
- Asset values
- Return on assets
- Tax timing (different book vs. tax methods)

**CEO Considerations:**
1. Industry norms for useful lives
2. Consistency over time
3. Matching physical reality
4. Peer comparisons

### Questions for Your CFO

1. "What's our CapEx-to-depreciation ratio, and is it sustainable?"
2. "What's the average age of our assets?"
3. "Are we deferring any maintenance CapEx?"
4. "How do our depreciation policies compare to competitors?"
5. "What major asset refreshes are needed in next 3-5 years?"

## Worked Example

### Fixed Asset Analysis: ManufacturingCo

**Data ($ millions):**

| | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
|---|------|------|------|
| Gross PP&E | $500 | $450 | $420 |
| Accumulated Depreciation | $200 | $170 | $145 |
| Net PP&E | $300 | $280 | $275 |
| Depreciation Expense | $35 | $30 | $28 |
| CapEx | $55 | $35 | $30 |
| Revenue | $600 | $550 | $520 |

**Analysis:**

**CapEx/Depreciation:**
```
2024: $55 / $35 = 1.57x ← Investing
2023: $35 / $30 = 1.17x ← Modest
2022: $30 / $28 = 1.07x ← Maintaining
```

**PP&E Turnover:**
```
2024: $600 / [($300+$280)/2] = 2.07x
2023: $550 / [($280+$275)/2] = 1.98x
2022: $520 / $275 = 1.89x (estimated)
```

**Average Asset Age:**
```
2024: $200 / $35 = 5.7 years
2023: $170 / $30 = 5.7 years
```

**Assessment:**
- CapEx increased significantly in 2024 (major project?)
- PP&E turnover improving (getting more revenue per asset dollar)
- Asset age stable around 5.7 years
- Company appears to be investing adequately

**Questions to investigate:**
- What drove the 2024 CapEx spike?
- Is it growth or catch-up maintenance?
- What's the expected return?

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Aggressive Capitalization
**Mistake:** Capitalizing costs that should be expensed.
**Reality:** Inflates assets and earnings; eventually reverses.

### 2. Ignoring Maintenance CapEx
**Mistake:** Cutting all CapEx to boost cash flow.
**Reality:** Deferred maintenance builds up, assets deteriorate.

### 3. Unrealistic Useful Lives
**Mistake:** Using overly long useful lives.
**Reality:** Understates depreciation, overstates income.

### 4. Ignoring Impairment
**Mistake:** Not testing for impairment when indicators present.
**Reality:** Assets may be overstated on balance sheet.

### 5. Confusing Book and Market Value
**Mistake:** Assuming book value equals what assets are worth.
**Reality:** Can differ dramatically, especially for real estate.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Capitalize vs. expense affects earnings timing** - But not total over asset life
2. **Depreciation method choice matters** - Accelerated vs. straight-line
3. **Useful life is an estimate** - Management has judgment
4. **CapEx/depreciation ratio is key** - Should be > 1.0 to maintain assets
5. **Average age reveals investment** - Aging assets = potential problems
6. **Impairment can be significant** - Write down when value declines
7. **Book ≠ market value** - Particularly for real estate

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Depreciation Calculation
Equipment cost: $200,000, Salvage: $20,000, Life: 8 years

Calculate Year 1 and Year 2 depreciation under:
a) Straight-line
b) Double-declining balance

### Problem 2: Asset Analysis
Company shows:
- CapEx/Depreciation: 0.7x for 3 consecutive years
- Average asset age increasing from 5 to 8 years
- Declining PP&E turnover

What concerns would you raise?

### Problem 3: Capitalization Decision
Company spends $50,000 on factory equipment maintenance including $20,000 for new component that extends life by 5 years. Original equipment cost $100,000 with 10-year life, now 6 years old.

How should these costs be treated?
