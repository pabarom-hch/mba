## Introduction

Liabilities represent obligations—promises to transfer resources in the future. For CEOs, understanding liabilities is critical for managing capital structure, evaluating financial risk, and maintaining covenant compliance. The right amount of debt creates value; too much destroys it.

## Core Concepts

### Liability Classification

**Current Liabilities (Due Within 1 Year):**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Accounts payable | Amounts owed to suppliers |
| Accrued expenses | Expenses incurred, not yet paid |
| Short-term debt | Borrowings due within year |
| Current portion of LTD | Long-term debt due within year |
| Deferred revenue | Unearned revenue |
| Income taxes payable | Taxes owed |

**Non-Current Liabilities:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Long-term debt | Bonds, term loans, notes |
| Lease liabilities | Operating and finance leases |
| Deferred tax liabilities | Timing differences |
| Pension obligations | Defined benefit promises |
| Other long-term | Environmental, legal reserves |

### Accounts Payable

**Recognition:** When goods/services received, before payment.

**Days Payable Outstanding (DPO):**
```
DPO = (Accounts Payable / COGS) × 365
```

**Strategic Consideration:**
- Extending payables = Free financing
- But: Can damage supplier relationships
- Industry norms vary (30-60 days typical)

### Accrued Liabilities

**Common Accruals:**
- Wages payable (earned, not yet paid)
- Interest payable (accrued since last payment)
- Taxes payable
- Utilities payable
- Warranty reserves

**Estimation Required:**
- Warranty costs based on historical rates
- Legal reserves based on probability assessment
- Environmental liabilities based on estimates

### Debt Accounting

**Initial Recognition:**
- Record at proceeds received (not face value if different)
- Include transaction costs

**Bond Example:**

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Face Value | $100,000 |
| Coupon Rate | 6% |
| Market Rate | 8% |
| Term | 5 years |

**Since Coupon < Market Rate:**
- Bond sells at discount
- Proceeds < Face Value

**Calculation:**
```
Present Value of Interest: PMT × PVIFA(8%, 5) = $6,000 × 3.9927 = $23,956
Present Value of Principal: FV × PVIF(8%, 5) = $100,000 × 0.6806 = $68,060
Issue Price: $23,956 + $68,060 = $92,016 (Discount of $7,984)
```

**Amortization:**
Discount amortized over life using effective interest method.

### Lease Accounting (ASC 842)

**All Leases Now on Balance Sheet:**

| Lease Type | Asset | Liability | Expense Pattern |
|------------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Finance | Right-of-use asset | Lease liability | Front-loaded |
| Operating | Right-of-use asset | Lease liability | Straight-line |

**Finance Lease Criteria (any one):**
1. Ownership transfers at end
2. Purchase option likely exercised
3. Lease term ≥ 75% of useful life
4. PV of payments ≥ 90% of fair value
5. Asset specialized for lessee

### Deferred Tax Liabilities

**Arise From Timing Differences:**

| Item | Book Treatment | Tax Treatment | Result |
|------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Depreciation | Straight-line | Accelerated | DTL |
| Revenue recognition | Accrual | Cash | DTL or DTA |
| Bad debt | Allowance method | Direct write-off | DTA |

**Deferred Tax Liability:**
- Tax paid later than book expense recognized
- Will reverse in future periods

## Debt Analysis

### Key Metrics

**Leverage Ratios:**

```
Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity

Debt-to-Assets = Total Liabilities / Total Assets

Debt-to-Capital = Debt / (Debt + Equity)

Net Debt-to-EBITDA = (Total Debt - Cash) / EBITDA
```

**Coverage Ratios:**

```
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense

Fixed Charge Coverage = (EBIT + Lease Payments) / (Interest + Lease Payments)

Debt Service Coverage = Operating Cash Flow / Debt Service
```

### Credit Analysis Framework

| Metric | Strong | Adequate | Weak |
|--------|--------|----------|------|
| Interest Coverage | > 5x | 3-5x | < 3x |
| Debt/EBITDA | < 2x | 2-4x | > 4x |
| Debt/Capital | < 30% | 30-50% | > 50% |

### Debt Capacity

**How Much Can a Company Borrow?**

```
Estimated Debt Capacity = EBITDA × Target Debt/EBITDA Multiple

Example:
EBITDA = $100M
Target Debt/EBITDA = 3.0x
Debt Capacity = $300M
```

**Factors Affecting Capacity:**
- Business stability
- Asset collateral value
- Industry norms
- Interest rate environment
- Existing covenants

---

## Off-Balance-Sheet Obligations

### Types to Watch

**Operating Leases (Pre-2019):**
- Now on balance sheet under ASC 842
- But look for short-term/variable leases

**Unconsolidated Entities:**
- Variable interest entities (VIEs)
- Joint ventures
- May have debt not on parent balance sheet

**Guarantees:**
- Loan guarantees for subsidiaries
- Performance guarantees
- Letters of credit

**Purchase Commitments:**
- Long-term supply contracts
- Take-or-pay agreements

### Finding Off-B/S Items

**Where to Look:**
1. Footnotes to financial statements
2. MD&A section
3. Contractual obligations table
4. Related party disclosures
5. Subsequent events

### Capital Structure Decisions

**Trade-offs:**

| Factor | Favors Debt | Favors Equity |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Tax | Interest deductible | - |
| Cost | Usually cheaper | More expensive |
| Control | No dilution | Dilution |
| Risk | Increases bankruptcy risk | Provides cushion |
| Flexibility | Covenants restrict | More flexibility |
| Signaling | Shows confidence | May signal overvaluation |

### Covenant Management

**Common Covenants:**

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Debt/EBITDA | Must stay below 3.5x |
| Interest coverage | Must stay above 3.0x |
| Minimum liquidity | Cash > $50M |
| Maximum capex | CapEx < $100M/year |
| Dividend restrictions | No dividends if coverage < 2x |

**Covenant Headroom:**
```
Covenant: Debt/EBITDA < 3.5x
Current: 2.8x
Headroom: 3.5x - 2.8x = 0.7x

EBITDA could fall 20% before breach
```

### Questions for Your CFO

1. "What's our debt maturity schedule?"
2. "How much covenant headroom do we have?"
3. "What's our weighted average cost of debt?"
4. "Are there any off-balance-sheet obligations I should know about?"
5. "What happens if EBITDA falls 20%?"

## Worked Example

### Debt Analysis: IndustrialCo

**Data ($ millions):**

| Item | 2024 | 2023 |
|------|------|------|
| Cash | $50 | $60 |
| Total Debt | $400 | $350 |
| Shareholders' Equity | $300 | $280 |
| EBITDA | $120 | $110 |
| Interest Expense | $25 | $22 |
| EBIT | $80 | $75 |

**Leverage Analysis:**

```
Debt/Equity:
2024: $400 / $300 = 1.33x
2023: $350 / $280 = 1.25x
↑ Increasing leverage

Net Debt/EBITDA:
2024: ($400 - $50) / $120 = 2.9x
2023: ($350 - $60) / $110 = 2.6x
↑ Increasing leverage
```

**Coverage Analysis:**

```
Interest Coverage:
2024: $80 / $25 = 3.2x
2023: $75 / $22 = 3.4x
↓ Declining coverage
```

**Assessment:**
- Leverage increasing (took on $50M net debt)
- Coverage still adequate but declining
- If covenant is 3.0x coverage, only 0.2x headroom
- Need to monitor closely

**Red Flags:**
- Debt growing faster than EBITDA
- Coverage approaching covenant levels
- Limited financial flexibility

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Off-Balance-Sheet Debt
**Mistake:** Looking only at reported debt.
**Reality:** Guarantees, leases, commitments matter too.

### 2. Using Total Liabilities as Debt
**Mistake:** Including operating liabilities in debt calculations.
**Reality:** Interest-bearing debt is what matters for leverage.

### 3. Ignoring Maturity Schedule
**Mistake:** Focusing only on total debt.
**Reality:** Near-term maturities create refinancing risk.

### 4. Overrelying on Net Debt
**Mistake:** Assuming cash fully offsets debt.
**Reality:** Cash may be restricted, foreign, or needed for operations.

### 5. Static Analysis
**Mistake:** Looking at debt metrics at one point.
**Reality:** Trends reveal direction of financial health.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Current vs. non-current matters** - Classification affects liquidity analysis
2. **Debt has costs beyond interest** - Covenants, refinancing risk, flexibility
3. **Leases are now on balance sheet** - Understand right-of-use assets and liabilities
4. **Coverage ratios assess debt service** - Ability to pay interest from operations
5. **Off-B/S items exist** - Read footnotes carefully
6. **Debt capacity is limited** - Based on EBITDA, stability, collateral
7. **Covenant headroom is crucial** - Know how much cushion exists

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Bond Pricing
A company issues $1,000,000 face value bonds:
- Coupon rate: 5% (annual)
- Market rate: 6%
- Term: 10 years

At what price will the bonds sell? (Use PVIF 6%, 10 = 0.5584; PVIFA 6%, 10 = 7.3601)

### Problem 2: Leverage Calculation
Company has:
- Cash: $30M
- Short-term debt: $20M
- Long-term debt: $180M
- Total liabilities: $350M
- Total equity: $150M
- EBITDA: $60M

Calculate: Debt/Equity, Net Debt/EBITDA, Debt/Capital

### Problem 3: Covenant Analysis
Covenant requires Interest Coverage > 2.5x
Current EBIT: $50M
Interest Expense: $15M

How much can EBIT fall before covenant breach?
