# The Balance Sheet

## Learning Objectives

- Understand balance sheet structure and components
- Analyze assets, liabilities, and equity accounts
- Interpret liquidity and solvency from the balance sheet
- Identify balance sheet quality issues
- Apply balance sheet analysis to business decisions

## Introduction

The balance sheet is a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It answers three fundamental questions: What does the company own? What does it owe? What's left for owners?

Unlike the income statement (which shows a period), the balance sheet shows a moment—December 31, for example. Think of it as a photograph vs. a movie.

### Assets

**Definition:** Resources the company controls that are expected to provide future economic benefit.

**Current Assets (Convert to Cash Within 1 Year):**

| Asset | Description | Key Issues |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Cash & Equivalents** | Currency, demand deposits, T-bills | Most liquid, but opportunity cost |
| **Short-term Investments** | Marketable securities | Fair value vs. cost |
| **Accounts Receivable** | Amounts owed by customers | Allowance for doubtful accounts |
| **Inventory** | Goods for sale | Valuation method (FIFO/LIFO) |
| **Prepaid Expenses** | Payments for future services | Rent, insurance paid in advance |

**Non-Current Assets:**

| Asset | Description | Key Issues |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **PP&E** | Property, plant, equipment | Depreciation, impairment |
| **Intangibles** | Patents, trademarks, software | Amortization, impairment |
| **Goodwill** | Premium paid in acquisitions | Annual impairment testing |
| **Investments** | Equity in other companies | Consolidation vs. equity method |
| **Right-of-use Assets** | Operating leases (ASC 842) | New under recent standards |

**Asset Valuation:**
- Historical cost (most assets)
- Fair value (some investments, derivatives)
- Net realizable value (receivables, inventory)
- Amortized cost (held-to-maturity investments)

### Liabilities

**Definition:** Obligations that will require future transfer of resources.

**Current Liabilities (Due Within 1 Year):**

| Liability | Description | Key Issues |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Accounts Payable** | Amounts owed to suppliers | Payment terms affect cash |
| **Accrued Expenses** | Expenses incurred but not paid | Wages, interest, taxes |
| **Short-term Debt** | Borrowings due within year | Refinancing risk |
| **Current Portion LTD** | Long-term debt due within year | Classification important |
| **Deferred Revenue** | Payments received for future services | Revenue recognition timing |

**Non-Current Liabilities:**

| Liability | Description | Key Issues |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Long-term Debt** | Bonds, term loans, notes | Interest rates, covenants |
| **Lease Liabilities** | Operating and finance leases | ASC 842 brought on balance sheet |
| **Deferred Taxes** | Timing differences (tax vs. book) | Can be large, complex |
| **Pension Obligations** | Defined benefit promises | Assumptions matter greatly |
| **Other Liabilities** | Legal reserves, contingencies | Estimation required |

**Off-Balance-Sheet Items to Watch:**
- Operating leases (pre-2019, now on B/S)
- Unconsolidated subsidiaries
- Guarantees and contingent liabilities
- Securitized receivables

### Shareholders' Equity

**Components:**

| Account | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Common Stock** | Par value × shares issued |
| **Preferred Stock** | If applicable, separate from common |
| **Additional Paid-in Capital (APIC)** | Amount above par value received |
| **Retained Earnings** | Accumulated net income - dividends |
| **Treasury Stock** | Cost of repurchased shares (negative) |
| **AOCI** | Unrealized gains/losses, FX translation |

**Equity Roll-Forward:**
```
Beginning Equity
+ Net Income
- Dividends
+/- Other Comprehensive Income
- Treasury Stock Purchases
+ Stock Issuance
= Ending Equity
```

## Balance Sheet Analysis

### Liquidity Analysis

**Current Ratio:**
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

> 1.0: Can cover near-term obligations
< 1.0: Potential liquidity issue
Industry norms vary (retailers lower, utilities higher)
```

**Quick Ratio (Acid Test):**
```
Quick Ratio = (Cash + Receivables + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities

Excludes inventory (may not convert quickly)
More conservative liquidity measure
```

**Cash Ratio:**
```
Cash Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Current Liabilities

Most conservative measure
Shows ability to pay immediately
```

### Solvency Analysis

**Debt-to-Equity:**
```
D/E = Total Debt / Total Equity

Higher = more leverage = more risk
Varies significantly by industry
```

**Debt-to-Assets:**
```
D/A = Total Liabilities / Total Assets

Shows what portion of assets funded by creditors
```

**Interest Coverage:**
```
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense

Ability to pay interest from operations
< 2.0 is concerning
```

### Working Capital Analysis

**Working Capital:**
```
Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Operating liquidity cushion
Should be positive for most businesses
```

**Cash Conversion Cycle:**
```
CCC = Days Inventory + Days Receivables - Days Payables

Days of cash tied up in operations
Lower is generally better
```

## Consulting Application

### Balance Sheet Due Diligence

When evaluating a company:

**Asset Quality Checklist:**

| Item | What to Check | Red Flag |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Receivables | Aging, allowance adequacy | Aging > 90 days, low allowance |
| Inventory | Obsolescence, turnover | Days increasing, write-downs |
| PP&E | Age, maintenance, impairment | Old assets, low capex |
| Goodwill | Size vs. equity, impairment history | Large, recent impairments |
| Intangibles | Capitalization policies | Aggressive capitalization |

**Liability Quality Checklist:**

| Item | What to Check | Red Flag |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Debt | Maturity schedule, covenants | Near-term maturities, tight covenants |
| Deferred revenue | Is it real obligation? | Declining trend |
| Contingent liabilities | Lawsuit reserves | Large undisclosed contingencies |
| Off-B/S items | Guarantees, VIEs | Significant undisclosed |

### Comparative Analysis Framework

Compare target company to:
1. Prior periods (trend analysis)
2. Competitors (peer benchmarking)
3. Industry averages (sector norms)

**Example Analysis:**

| Metric | Company | Peer Avg | Assessment |
|--------|---------|----------|------------|
| Current ratio | 1.2 | 1.8 | Below average liquidity |
| D/E | 2.5 | 1.5 | Higher leverage |
| Receivables days | 60 | 45 | Slower collections |
| Inventory days | 90 | 60 | Excess inventory |

## CEO Application

### Reading Your Balance Sheet

**Key Questions to Ask:**

1. **Liquidity:** "Can we meet short-term obligations?"
   - Review current ratio trend
   - Check cash runway
   - Assess working capital adequacy

2. **Leverage:** "Are we appropriately capitalized?"
   - Compare debt levels to peers
   - Review covenant headroom
   - Consider interest rate exposure

3. **Asset Efficiency:** "Are assets generating returns?"
   - Calculate asset turnover
   - Review working capital efficiency
   - Identify underperforming assets

4. **Quality:** "Are numbers reliable?"
   - Review auditor's opinion
   - Check for restatements
   - Understand key estimates

### Balance Sheet Strategy

**Optimize Working Capital:**
- Faster collections → Lower receivables → More cash
- Slower payments → Higher payables → More cash
- Lean inventory → Less capital tied up

**Manage Capital Structure:**
- Right mix of debt and equity
- Match debt maturity to asset life
- Maintain financial flexibility

**Quality of Assets:**
- Productive assets earn returns
- Impaired assets drag performance
- Regular asset review critical

## Worked Example

### Balance Sheet Analysis: RetailCo

**RetailCo Balance Sheet ($ millions):**

| Assets | 2024 | 2023 | Liabilities & Equity | 2024 | 2023 |
|--------|------|------|---------------------|------|------|
| Cash | $50 | $80 | Accounts Payable | $120 | $100 |
| Receivables | $30 | $25 | Accrued Expenses | $40 | $35 |
| Inventory | $200 | $150 | Short-term Debt | $20 | $30 |
| **Total Current** | **$280** | **$255** | **Total Current** | **$180** | **$165** |
| PP&E, net | $400 | $380 | Long-term Debt | $200 | $180 |
| Goodwill | $100 | $100 | **Total Liabilities** | **$380** | **$345** |
| Other Assets | $20 | $15 | Common Stock | $50 | $50 |
| | | | Retained Earnings | $370 | $355 |
| | | | **Total Equity** | **$420** | **$405** |
| **Total Assets** | **$800** | **$750** | **Total L&E** | **$800** | **$750** |

**Analysis:**

**Liquidity:**
```
Current Ratio 2024: $280 / $180 = 1.56
Current Ratio 2023: $255 / $165 = 1.55
Stable, adequate liquidity
```

**Solvency:**
```
D/E 2024: ($20 + $200) / $420 = 0.52
D/E 2023: ($30 + $180) / $405 = 0.52
Moderate leverage, stable
```

**Working Capital Trends:**

| Item | 2024 | 2023 | Change | Concern |
|------|------|------|--------|---------|
| Receivables | $30 | $25 | +20% | Growing faster than sales? |
| Inventory | $200 | $150 | +33% | Significant buildup |
| Payables | $120 | $100 | +20% | Extending payment terms |

**Assessment:**
Inventory increase of 33% is concerning. Either:
- Sales growth expected (good)
- Demand slowing, excess inventory (bad)
- New product launch (depends)

Need to check inventory turnover and compare to sales growth.

If sales grew 15% but inventory grew 33%, there may be an obsolescence or demand problem.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Off-Balance-Sheet Items
**Mistake:** Thinking balance sheet shows all obligations.
**Reality:** Guarantees, VIEs, some leases (historically) not shown.

### 2. Assuming Book Value = Market Value
**Mistake:** Thinking assets are worth balance sheet amounts.
**Reality:** Market values can differ significantly, especially for intangibles.

### 3. Treating All Debt Equally
**Mistake:** Looking only at total debt.
**Reality:** Terms, covenants, maturity, currency all matter.

### 4. Ignoring Goodwill
**Mistake:** Treating goodwill as regular asset.
**Reality:** Goodwill doesn't generate cash directly; represents past acquisition premiums.

### 5. Static Analysis
**Mistake:** Looking at one balance sheet in isolation.
**Reality:** Trends and comparisons reveal more than single snapshots.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Balance sheet is a snapshot** - Point in time, not a period
2. **Assets = Liabilities + Equity** - Must always balance
3. **Current vs. Non-current matters** - Liquidity classification is critical
4. **Quality varies** - Not all assets or liabilities are equal
5. **Off-B/S items exist** - Read the notes carefully
6. **Ratios provide insight** - Liquidity, solvency, efficiency
7. **Trends matter most** - Compare to prior periods and peers

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Ratio Calculation
Given the following data:
- Cash: $50M
- Receivables: $100M
- Inventory: $150M
- Current Liabilities: $200M
- Total Debt: $400M
- Total Equity: $300M

Calculate:
a) Current ratio
b) Quick ratio
c) Debt-to-equity ratio

### Problem 2: Transaction Impact
For each transaction, show the effect on the balance sheet:
a) Purchase $100M inventory on credit
b) Collect $50M of receivables
c) Issue $200M of bonds
d) Declare (but don't pay) $20M dividend

### Problem 3: Balance Sheet Reconstruction
A company's balance sheet shows Total Assets of $500M and Total Equity of $200M. During the year, the company:
- Earned net income of $50M
- Paid dividends of $10M
- Repurchased $30M of stock
- Issued $100M of new debt

What was beginning equity? What is ending total liabilities?
