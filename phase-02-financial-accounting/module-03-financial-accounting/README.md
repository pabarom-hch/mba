## Why Financial Accounting Matters for CEOs

### Strategic Decisions
Every major decision involves financial analysis:
- Should we acquire this company? (Analyze their financials)
- Is this supplier financially stable? (Credit analysis)
- How do we compare to competitors? (Comparative analysis)

### Investor Relations
You'll communicate with:
- Equity analysts who scrutinize every line item
- Board members who ask tough questions
- Potential investors evaluating your company

### Performance Management
Financial statements are the scorecard:
- Are we actually profitable, or just growing revenue?
- Where is our cash going?
- What's our real return on invested capital?

### Risk Management
Financial indicators reveal risks:
- Is our customer financially healthy?
- Are we over-leveraged?
- Can we fund growth internally or need external capital?

## Accounting Standards

This course primarily uses US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). Key standard-setting bodies:

- **FASB** (Financial Accounting Standards Board) - Sets US GAAP
- **SEC** - Enforces standards for public companies
- **IASB** - Sets IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards)

Where GAAP and IFRS differ significantly, both treatments are noted.

## Study Approach

1. **Learn the mechanics** - Understand how transactions flow to statements
2. **Practice reading real statements** - Use 10-K filings from sec.gov
3. **Calculate ratios** - Build intuition for what's normal
4. **Compare companies** - Industry comparisons reveal insights
5. **Look for patterns** - Good and bad financial health have signatures
