## Analysis Framework

### Profitability Analysis

**Margin Trends:**

| Metric | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|-------|
| Gross Margin | 30.0% | 32.0% | 34.0% | ↓ Declining |
| Operating Margin | 8.0% | 10.0% | 12.0% | ↓ Declining |
| Net Margin | 5.4% | 6.9% | 8.4% | ↓ Declining |

**Margin Decomposition:**
```
Gross Margin dropped 4 ppts (34% → 30%):
- COGS/Revenue: 70% → 68% → 66%
- Mix shift? Pricing pressure? Cost increases?

SG&A/Revenue:
2024: 20.0%
2023: 20.0%
2022: 20.0%
- Stable as % of revenue

Operating margin compression entirely from gross margin
```

**Segment Analysis:**
- Retail stores: Margin compressed 31% → 28%
- E-commerce: Margin compressed 40% → 38%
- Both segments declining—not just channel shift

**Concerns:**
1. Gross margin declining 200 bps/year
2. Pattern suggests pricing pressure or cost increases
3. If continues, operating income could approach zero in 3-4 years

### Working Capital Assessment

**Days Metrics:**

| Metric | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | Industry |
|--------|------|------|------|----------|
| Days Sales Outstanding | 7.3 | 6.3 | 6.1 | 5.0 |
| Days Inventory | 83.4 | 74.7 | 71.1 | 73.0 |
| Days Payable | 37.5 | 37.4 | 39.5 | 45.0 |
| **Cash Conversion Cycle** | **53.2** | **43.6** | **37.7** | **33.0** |

**Calculations:**
```
DSO 2024: (50/2,500) × 365 = 7.3 days
DIO 2024: (400/1,750) × 365 = 83.4 days
DPO 2024: (180/1,750) × 365 = 37.5 days
CCC 2024: 7.3 + 83.4 - 37.5 = 53.2 days
```

**Concerns:**
1. Inventory days increased 12 days in 2 years
2. Cash conversion cycle up 15 days
3. Cash being consumed by working capital
4. May indicate slow-moving inventory buildup

### Cash Flow Quality

**OCF/Net Income:**
```
2024: 118/135 = 0.87x
2023: 161/159 = 1.01x
2022: 200/177 = 1.13x

Trend: Deteriorating significantly
```

**Working Capital Impact:**
```
2024 WC consumption: $67M
2023 WC consumption: $43M
2022 WC consumption: $19M

Working capital consuming increasingly more cash
```

**Free Cash Flow:**
```
2024: 118 - 80 = $38M
2023: 161 - 65 = $96M
2022: 200 - 55 = $145M

FCF declining despite similar CapEx
```

**Concerns:**
1. OCF/NI ratio declining (was 1.13x, now 0.87x)
2. Inventory buildup consuming cash
3. FCF dropped from $145M to $38M in 2 years
4. Company funding dividends with debt

### Valuation Assessment

**EBITDA Calculation:**
```
2024 EBITDA = 200 + 50 = $250M
Enterprise Value = $1,200M
EV/EBITDA = 4.8x

Wait—asking price is $1.2B "at 8x EBITDA"
Implies EBITDA of $150M—not current $250M?

Let's recalculate:
Purchase Price: $1,200M
Current EBITDA: $250M
EV/EBITDA: 4.8x ← Actually attractive

But if margins continue to compress:
Year 3 EBITDA might be: $150M
Then 8x is the forward multiple
```

**Valuation Considerations:**

| Factor | Impact on Value |
|--------|-----------------|
| Margin compression | Negative—reduces future earnings |
| Working capital needs | Negative—cash consumption |
| Debt levels | Manageable currently |
| E-commerce growth | Positive—33% growth |
| Brand/market position | Need more info |

**Comparable Analysis:**

| Metric | TechRetail | Industry |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| EV/EBITDA (current) | 4.8x | 6-8x |
| EV/Revenue | 0.48x | 0.30-0.50x |

At current EBITDA, price seems reasonable. But with declining margins, true normalized EBITDA may be lower.

### Investment Recommendation

**Key Risks:**

1. **Margin Compression**: Gross margin declined 400 bps in 2 years. If this continues, profitability disappears.

2. **Inventory Buildup**: 25% increase in inventory vs. 9% revenue growth suggests potential obsolescence or demand issues.

3. **Cash Flow Deterioration**: FCF dropped 74% in 2 years. Business is consuming rather than generating cash.

4. **Debt-Funded Dividends**: Company borrowing to pay dividends while cash declines. Unsustainable.

5. **Retail Disruption**: Core retail business facing structural headwinds.

**Opportunities:**

1. **E-commerce Growth**: 33% growth, still profitable. Potential for further expansion.

2. **Services Business**: 55% margin, stable. Could expand attachment rates.

3. **Operational Improvement**: Inventory management, working capital efficiency.

4. **Store Optimization**: Close underperforming stores, improve remaining.

**Recommendation: CONDITIONAL PROCEED**

Price is reasonable at current EBITDA, but significant risks require:

1. **Negotiate price down** to 3.5-4x EBITDA ($875M-$1,000M) to account for margin compression risk

2. **Due diligence on inventory**: Age, obsolescence, realizable value

3. **Management interviews**: Understand margin compression drivers and turnaround plan

4. **Stress test**: Model scenarios with continued margin decline

5. **Identify quick wins**: Working capital improvement, store closures

**Value Creation Plan Required:**
- Working capital optimization: +$100M cash
- Store closures (bottom 20%): +$20M EBITDA
- E-commerce investment: Maintain growth
- Services expansion: Increase attach rate

## Teaching Note

### Key Learning Points

1. **Trend analysis reveals problems**: Margins declining, working capital consuming cash, FCF collapsing

2. **Multiple ratios tell a story**: Each ratio adds a piece—synthesis is key

3. **Quality matters for valuation**: Headline EBITDA may not be sustainable

4. **Cash flow validates earnings**: Declining OCF/NI ratio is warning sign

5. **Working capital analysis is critical**: Inventory buildup is major concern

### Common Mistakes

- Focusing only on current ratios, not trends
- Accepting EBITDA without quality assessment
- Ignoring working capital dynamics
- Not stress-testing projections
