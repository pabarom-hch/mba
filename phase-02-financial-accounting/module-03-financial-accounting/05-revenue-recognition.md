## Introduction

Revenue is the top line—the foundation of financial performance. But when exactly is revenue "earned"? This seemingly simple question has caused billions in restatements and countless accounting frauds.

For CEOs, understanding revenue recognition isn't just accounting trivia—it directly affects reported results, compensation tied to revenue, and investor expectations.

## Core Concepts

### ASC 606: The Five-Step Model

**Step 1: Identify the Contract**
- Agreement creating enforceable rights and obligations
- Can be written, oral, or implied
- Must have commercial substance

**Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations**
- Distinct goods or services promised
- Customer can benefit from good/service on its own
- Examples: Products, installation, maintenance, training

**Step 3: Determine Transaction Price**
- Amount expected to receive
- Consider: Variable consideration, financing, non-cash consideration
- Exclude amounts collected for third parties (sales tax)

**Step 4: Allocate Transaction Price**
- Allocate to each performance obligation
- Based on standalone selling prices
- Use estimation if standalone price not available

**Step 5: Recognize Revenue**
- When (or as) performance obligation is satisfied
- Point in time or over time
- Transfer of control is key concept

### Point in Time vs. Over Time

**Revenue Recognized at a Point in Time:**
- Control transfers at a specific moment
- Examples: Product delivery, title transfer

**Revenue Recognized Over Time:**
- Performance obligation satisfied over time
- Criteria (any one):
  1. Customer receives and consumes benefits simultaneously
  2. Creates or enhances customer-controlled asset
  3. No alternative use to seller + right to payment for performance completed

### Common Revenue Recognition Patterns

| Business Type | Typical Recognition | Key Considerations |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Product sales | Delivery/transfer of control | FOB shipping vs. destination |
| Software (perpetual) | Delivery | Plus maintenance over time |
| SaaS/Subscriptions | Ratably over contract | Monthly/annual recognition |
| Construction | Over time (% complete) | Measure progress reliably |
| Professional services | As services performed | Time-based or milestone |
| Franchise fees | When obligations met | Initial vs. ongoing |

### Variable Consideration

**Types:**
- Volume discounts
- Rebates
- Price concessions
- Performance bonuses
- Penalties

**Constraint:** Include only amounts probable not to reverse.

**Methods:**
1. Expected value (probability-weighted)
2. Most likely amount

## Revenue Recognition Risks

### Aggressive Revenue Recognition

**Warning Signs:**

| Red Flag | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Channel stuffing | Shipping excess to distributors near quarter-end |
| Bill-and-hold | Recording revenue before shipment |
| Side agreements | Undisclosed return rights |
| Percentage manipulation | Overstating completion % |
| Consignment as sale | Recording consigned goods as sales |
| Round-tripping | Fake revenue with related parties |
| Gross vs. net | Reporting gross when should be net |

### Timing Manipulation

**Quarter-End Patterns:**

```
Monthly Revenue Distribution:
  Normal: Month 1: 32%, Month 2: 33%, Month 3: 35%
  Warning: Month 1: 20%, Month 2: 25%, Month 3: 55%
```

**Why End-of-Quarter Matters:**
- Salespeople push deals to make quota
- Managers push to meet expectations
- Customers get better terms at quarter-end
- Creates incentive for manipulation

### Deferred Revenue Issues

**Deferred Revenue (Contract Liability):**
- Payment received before performance
- Should decrease as service provided
- Watch for: Deferred revenue NOT declining

## Consulting Application

### Revenue Due Diligence

**Checklist:**

| Area | Questions | Data Needs |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Policy | What's the recognition policy? | Accounting policies note |
| Timing | When is revenue recognized? | Specific triggers |
| Estimates | What judgments are involved? | Management discussion |
| Returns | What's the return/refund policy? | Historical return rates |
| Concentration | Who are major customers? | Customer lists, contracts |

### Revenue Quality Assessment

**High Quality:**
- Recurring/predictable
- Diverse customer base
- Long-term contracts
- Low churn
- Consistent recognition patterns

**Low Quality:**
- One-time/project-based
- Concentrated customers
- Quarter-end heavy
- High returns/cancellations
- Changing recognition policies

### Contract Analysis

**Key Contract Terms Affecting Revenue:**

| Term | Revenue Impact |
|------|----------------|
| Payment terms | May indicate financing component |
| Return rights | May delay recognition |
| Acceptance clauses | May delay until accepted |
| Warranties | Separate vs. assurance-type |
| Free services | Separate performance obligation |

### Understanding Your Revenue

**Questions for Your CFO:**
1. "What triggers revenue recognition for each product line?"
2. "What's our quarterly revenue linearity?"
3. "How much revenue is recognized over time vs. at a point?"
4. "What estimates significantly affect revenue?"
5. "What's our remaining performance obligations (backlog)?"

### Common Revenue Issues

**SaaS/Subscription:**
- Professional services: Point in time or over time?
- Implementation fees: Separate or combined?
- Usage-based components: Variable consideration

**Manufacturing:**
- FOB shipping point vs. destination
- Customer acceptance requirements
- Installation services

**Long-term Contracts:**
- Progress measurement method

## Worked Example

### Software Company Revenue Recognition

**TechSoft sells:**
- Perpetual software license: $100,000
- 1-year maintenance: $20,000
- Implementation services: $30,000
- Total contract: $150,000

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: Identify Contract**
- Written agreement exists ✓

**Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations**
Three distinct obligations:
1. Software license (customer can use independently)
2. Maintenance (distinct service)
3. Implementation (could be distinct or combined)

**Step 3: Determine Transaction Price**
- $150,000 total
- No variable consideration

**Step 4: Allocate Based on Standalone Selling Prices**

| Obligation | Standalone Price | Allocation % | Allocated Revenue |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| License | $110,000 | 65% | $97,500 |
| Maintenance | $25,000 | 15% | $22,500 |
| Implementation | $35,000 | 20% | $30,000 |
| **Total** | $170,000 | 100% | $150,000 |

**Step 5: Recognize Revenue**

| Obligation | Timing | Recognition |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| License | Point in time (delivery) | $97,500 at delivery |
| Maintenance | Over time (ratably) | $1,875/month for 12 months |
| Implementation | Over time (as performed) | As hours delivered |

**Journal Entry at Delivery:**
```
Debit: Cash/Receivable         $150,000
Credit: Revenue (License)       $97,500
Credit: Deferred Revenue         $52,500
```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Recognizing Revenue Too Early
**Mistake:** Recording revenue before all criteria met.
**Reality:** Must satisfy performance obligation AND transfer control.

### 2. Ignoring Variable Consideration
**Mistake:** Recording full contract value ignoring discounts, returns.
**Reality:** Must estimate and constrain variable amounts.

### 3. Combining Performance Obligations
**Mistake:** Treating entire contract as one obligation.
**Reality:** Distinct obligations must be identified and separated.

### 4. Gross vs. Net Confusion
**Mistake:** Recording gross revenue when acting as agent.
**Reality:** If not controlling goods/services, record net (commission only).

### 5. Percentage of Completion Manipulation
**Mistake:** Manipulating progress estimates.
**Reality:** Must use reliable measure; estimates must be reasonable.

## Key Takeaways

1. **ASC 606 governs all** - Five-step model is universal framework
2. **Performance obligations are key** - Identify what you're promising
3. **Timing matters enormously** - Point in time vs. over time
4. **Variable consideration requires constraint** - Only what's probable
5. **Control transfer triggers recognition** - Not just delivery or payment
6. **Watch quarterly patterns** - End-of-quarter spikes are warning signs
7. **Deferred revenue is leading indicator** - Shows future revenue already sold

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Performance Obligation Identification
A company sells:
- Equipment: $500,000
- Installation: $50,000
- 3-year maintenance: $75,000 ($25,000/year)
- Training: Included at no charge

Identify performance obligations. How should revenue be recognized?

### Problem 2: Variable Consideration
Contract price: $1,000,000
Terms: 10% bonus if completed within 6 months
Probability assessment: 70% likely to receive bonus

How much transaction price should be recognized?

### Problem 3: Gross vs. Net
Online marketplace facilitates $10M in transactions. Charges sellers 15% fee. Marketplace never takes title to goods.

Should revenue be recorded as $10M or $1.5M? Why?
