## Introduction

Financial statement analysis transforms raw numbers into actionable insight. It's the skill that separates those who can read statements from those who can interpret them. For CEOs and consultants, this is core capability—turning financial data into strategic understanding.

## Core Concepts

### Ratio Analysis Framework

**Categories of Ratios:**

| Category | Purpose | Key Questions |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Profitability | How profitable is the company? | Are margins adequate? |
| Liquidity | Can it meet short-term obligations? | Is cash position healthy? |
| Solvency | Can it meet long-term obligations? | Is leverage appropriate? |
| Efficiency | How well are assets used? | Is capital deployed effectively? |
| Valuation | How does market value compare? | Is stock fairly priced? |

### Profitability Ratios

**Gross Margin:**
```
Gross Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue
```
Measures: Pricing power, production efficiency

**Operating Margin:**
```
Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue
```
Measures: Core business profitability

**Net Margin:**
```
Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue
```
Measures: Bottom-line profitability

**Return on Assets (ROA):**
```
ROA = Net Income / Average Total Assets
```
Measures: How efficiently assets generate profit

**Return on Equity (ROE):**
```
ROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity
```
Measures: Return to equity holders

**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**
```
ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital

Where:
NOPAT = Operating Income × (1 - Tax Rate)
Invested Capital = Equity + Debt - Cash
```
Measures: Return on capital employed (best measure of operating performance)

### Liquidity Ratios

**Current Ratio:**
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```
Benchmark: > 1.0 (varies by industry)

**Quick Ratio:**
```
Quick Ratio = (Cash + Receivables + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities
```
Benchmark: > 0.8

**Cash Ratio:**
```
Cash Ratio = Cash / Current Liabilities
```
Most conservative measure

### Solvency Ratios

**Debt-to-Equity:**
```
D/E = Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
```

**Debt-to-Capital:**
```
D/C = Total Debt / (Total Debt + Equity)
```

**Interest Coverage:**
```
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
```
Benchmark: > 3.0

**Debt-to-EBITDA:**
```
Debt/EBITDA = Total Debt / EBITDA
```
Benchmark: < 3.0 for most industries

### Efficiency Ratios

**Asset Turnover:**
```
Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets
```

**Inventory Turnover:**
```
Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
```

**Receivables Turnover:**
```
Receivables Turnover = Revenue / Average Receivables
```

**Payables Turnover:**
```
Payables Turnover = COGS / Average Payables
```

**Cash Conversion Cycle:**
```
CCC = Days Inventory + Days Receivables - Days Payables
```

## DuPont Analysis

### Three-Part DuPont

```
ROE = Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier

ROE = (Net Income/Revenue) × (Revenue/Assets) × (Assets/Equity)

ROE = Profitability × Efficiency × Leverage
```

**Example:**
```
Company A: ROE = 15%
- Net Margin: 5%
- Asset Turnover: 1.5x
- Equity Multiplier: 2.0x
- ROE = 5% × 1.5 × 2.0 = 15%

Company B: ROE = 15%
- Net Margin: 10%
- Asset Turnover: 0.75x
- Equity Multiplier: 2.0x
- ROE = 10% × 0.75 × 2.0 = 15%

Same ROE, different drivers!
```

### Five-Part DuPont

```
ROE = (EBIT/Revenue) × (Revenue/Assets) × (Assets/Equity) ×
      (EBT/EBIT) × (Net Income/EBT)

ROE = Operating Margin × Asset Turnover × Leverage ×
      Interest Burden × Tax Burden
```

**Adds Insight About:**
- Impact of debt (interest burden)
- Impact of taxes (tax burden)
- Operating performance vs. financial structure

## Analysis Techniques

### Common-Size Analysis

**Income Statement (% of Revenue):**

| Line | Company | Peer 1 | Peer 2 | Industry |
|------|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Revenue | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| COGS | 60.0% | 55.0% | 58.0% | 57.0% |
| Gross Margin | 40.0% | 45.0% | 42.0% | 43.0% |
| SG&A | 20.0% | 18.0% | 22.0% | 20.0% |
| R&D | 5.0% | 8.0% | 6.0% | 6.3% |
| Operating Margin | 15.0% | 19.0% | 14.0% | 16.7% |

**Balance Sheet (% of Total Assets):**

| Line | Company | Peer Avg |
|------|---------|----------|
| Cash | 10% | 8% |
| Receivables | 15% | 12% |
| Inventory | 20% | 15% |
| PP&E | 40% | 45% |
| Goodwill | 15% | 20% |

### Trend Analysis

**Year-over-Year Growth:**
```
Growth = (Current - Prior) / Prior × 100%
```

**CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**
```
CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/n) - 1
```

**Example:**
```
Revenue: $100M (Year 1) → $150M (Year 5)
CAGR = ($150/$100)^(1/4) - 1 = 10.7%
```

### Peer Comparison

**Selection Criteria:**
- Same industry
- Similar size
- Similar business model
- Same geographic markets

**Comparison Framework:**

| Metric | Company | Peer 1 | Peer 2 | Assessment |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|------------|
| Revenue Growth | 8% | 12% | 6% | Lagging Peer 1 |
| Gross Margin | 40% | 42% | 38% | In line |
| ROIC | 12% | 15% | 10% | Room to improve |
| D/E | 0.8x | 0.5x | 1.2x | Moderate |

**Balance Sheet ($M):**
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
|---|------|------|------|
| Cash | 50 | 60 | 70 |
| Receivables | 120 | 100 | 90 |
| Inventory | 150 | 130 | 110 |
| Total Current | 320 | 290 | 270 |
| PP&E, net | 400 | 380 | 360 |
| Total Assets | 800 | 750 | 700 |
| Current Liabilities | 180 | 160 | 150 |
| Long-term Debt | 200 | 180 | 150 |
| Total Equity | 420 | 410 | 400 |

**Analysis:**

**Profitability:**
```
Gross Margin:
2024: 40.0%, 2023: 41.1%, 2022: 42.4% ← Declining

Operating Margin:
2024: 20.0%, 2023: 21.1%, 2022: 22.4% ← Declining

Net Margin:
2024: 13.5%, 2023: 14.3%, 2022: 15.4% ← Declining

ROE: 135 / [(420+410)/2] = 32.5%

ROIC: 200×0.75 / [(420+200-50)+(410+180-60)]/2 = 150/550 = 27.3%
```

**Efficiency:**
```
Asset Turnover: 1,000 / [(800+750)/2] = 1.29x
Receivables Days: (120/1,000) × 365 = 44 days
Inventory Days: (150/600) × 365 = 91 days
```

**Solvency:**
```
D/E: 200/420 = 0.48x
Interest Coverage: 200/20 = 10.0x
Debt/EBITDA: ~1.0x (assuming D&A ~$40M)
```

**DuPont:**
```
ROE = 13.5% × 1.29 × 1.90 = 33.1% ✓

Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier
```

**Synthesis:**

**Strengths:**
- Strong returns (ROE 32.5%, ROIC 27.3%)
- Low leverage (D/E 0.48x)
- Excellent coverage (10x)
- Good asset turnover

**Concerns:**
- Declining margins (42.4% → 40.0% gross)
- Receivables building (44 days, up from 39)
- Inventory building (91 days, up from 80)
- Cash declining while debt growing

**Recommendations:**
1. Investigate margin pressure—pricing or costs?
2. Tighten receivables collection
3. Assess inventory levels for obsolescence risk
4. Monitor working capital consumption

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: DuPont Analysis
Company has: Net Margin 8%, Asset Turnover 1.2x, D/E 0.5x
a) Calculate ROE
b) If margin improves to 10% with no other changes, what's new ROE?
c) How would increasing leverage to D/E of 1.0x affect ROE?

### Problem 2: Peer Comparison
Given data for Company vs. Peer:
- Gross Margin: 35% vs. 40%
- Asset Turnover: 1.5x vs. 1.2x
- Debt/EBITDA: 2.5x vs. 3.0x

Which company is performing better? What questions would you ask?

### Problem 3: Comprehensive Analysis
Analyze the following (calculate key ratios, identify trends, make recommendations):
- Revenue flat at $500M for 3 years
- Gross margin improved from 30% to 35%
- SG&A increased from 15% to 20% of revenue
- Receivables days increased from 45 to 60
- Cash flow from operations declined 30%
