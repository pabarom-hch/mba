## The Journey: Think → Build → Be → Lead

### Q1: THINK (Weeks 1-13)
*Mental Models & Decision-Making with Munger and Buffett*

Before you can lead others, you must learn to think clearly. This quarter builds your mental toolkit—the frameworks that will guide every decision you make as a CEO.

### Q2: BUILD (Weeks 14-26)
*Wealth & Organizations with Carnegie and Hill*

With clear thinking established, you learn to build. Carnegie built one of the greatest industrial empires. Hill codified the principles of achievement. Together, they teach you to construct something that lasts.

### Q3: BE (Weeks 27-39)
*Personal Mastery & Character with Rohn and Gandhi*

The organization reflects its leader. This quarter turns inward—mastering yourself, your habits, your character. Rohn teaches daily discipline; Gandhi teaches moral authority.

### Q4: LEAD (Weeks 40-52)
*Leadership & Legacy with Mandela and Maxwell*

Finally, you lead. Mandela shows leadership through character and adversity. Maxwell provides the practical laws of influence. Together, they prepare you to leave a legacy.
