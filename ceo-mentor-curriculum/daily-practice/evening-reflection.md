# Evening Reflection Guide

> "Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action." — Peter Drucker

## Purpose

The evening reflection closes the learning loop. Without reflection, experience teaches nothing. This practice converts the day's events into wisdom and prepares the subconscious mind to work on challenges overnight.

This practice takes 10 minutes and should be done before evening entertainment or sleep.

## The Practice (10 Minutes)

### Step 1: Transition (1 minute)

Create a clear boundary between day and reflection.

- Move to your reflection space
- Close work applications/put away phone
- Take 3 deep breaths
- Shift from doing mode to being mode

*You cannot reflect while still racing.*

---

### Step 2: Recall the Day's Principle (1 minute)

Bring back to mind:
- The mentor you focused on today
- The principle for the day
- The intention you set this morning

*You may reference the week file or recall from memory.*

---

### Step 3: Answer the Day's Journal Prompt (5 minutes)

Each day in the weekly curriculum includes a journal prompt. Respond in writing.

**If journaling feels difficult:**
- Write stream-of-consciousness—don't edit
- Even 3-4 sentences count
- The act of writing forces clarity
- Bad writing is better than no writing

**If there's no prompt (or you want more):**

**Universal Evening Questions:**
1. Where did I apply today's principle well?
2. Where did I fail to apply it?
3. What would [mentor's name] say about how I handled today?
4. What will I do differently tomorrow?
5. What am I grateful for today?

---

### Step 4: Score the Day (1 minute)

Rate your application of the day's principle: **1-10**

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-3 | Completely forgot or ignored the principle |
| 4-5 | Remembered but inconsistently applied |
| 6-7 | Applied in most situations |
| 8-9 | Principle guided most decisions |
| 10 | Exemplary application throughout |

**Record your score.** Over time, patterns emerge. Certain principles may consistently score low—those need more attention.

*Be honest. The only person you cheat by inflating scores is yourself.*

---

### Step 5: Identify Tomorrow's Opportunity (2 minutes)

Based on today's reflection, identify one specific opportunity to apply the principle tomorrow.

**Ask:**
- Where did I struggle today that I'll face again tomorrow?
- What situation tomorrow would benefit from this principle?
- What's my edge—one small improvement I can make?

**Write it down:**
> Tomorrow's opportunity: ________________________________

*This primes your subconscious and creates continuity between days.*

**9:01 PM** — 3 deep breaths, transition

**9:02 PM** — Recall principle and intention

## The Reflection Journal

Keeping a dedicated journal for this practice creates:

- **A record** of your development over 52 weeks
- **Pattern recognition** when reviewed monthly
- **Accountability** through honest scoring
- **Evidence** of transformation when you doubt progress

**Format options:**
- Physical notebook (recommended for focus)
- Digital document
- Dedicated app

## Reflection Frameworks

### The 3-3-3 Review
- 3 things I'm grateful for
- 3 things I learned
- 3 things I'll do differently

### The Mentor Perspective
- What would [mentor] praise about my day?
- What would [mentor] critique?
- What would [mentor] advise for tomorrow?

### The CEO Lens
- Did I act like the CEO I want to become today?
- Where did I think short-term when I should have thought long-term?
- Who did I develop or add value to?

### The Principle Audit
- How many decisions today aligned with the principle?
- Which decisions violated it?
- What pattern do I notice?

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

### "I'm too tired at night"

Move the reflection earlier—after dinner, not before bed. Or reduce to 5 minutes minimum. Fatigue is often an excuse, not a reality.

### "I don't know what to write"

Start with "Today I..." and don't stop writing for 3 minutes. The prompt is a starting point, not a cage.

### "My scores are always low"

Low scores are data, not failure. They reveal where you need growth. A consistent 4 that improves to 6 over months is progress.

### "I forget to do it"

- Set a phone reminder
- Tie it to an existing habit (after brushing teeth)
- Put journal in a visible location
- Ask someone to hold you accountable

### "It feels pointless"

Review your journal after 30 days. The compound insight is not visible day-to-day but becomes obvious over time.

## Weekly Integration

On Day 7 of each week (the weekly review day), use the evening reflection differently:

1. Review all 6 days of journal entries
2. Calculate your average principle score
3. Identify the day's entries with the most insight
4. Summarize the week's key learning in 2-3 sentences
5. Set intention for the next week

## The Psychology of Evening Reflection

When you reflect before sleep:

- The subconscious mind processes the material overnight
- Connections form that wouldn't emerge during busy days
- Morning insights often result from evening reflection
- The day is "closed" properly, reducing rumination

This is why many traditions (religious, philosophical, therapeutic) include evening examination of conscience or review.

## Tracking Over Time

Monthly review questions:
- What was my average principle score this month?
- Which principles did I struggle with most?
- Which principles came naturally?
- What patterns emerge from my journal entries?
- How has my leadership changed?

Quarterly review questions:
- How have I grown across this quarter's theme?
- What are my three biggest insights?
- What mentors' teachings resonate most?
- What do I need to focus on next quarter?
