# Charlie Munger

> "Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up."

## Biography

Charles Thomas Munger (1924-2023) was an American businessman, investor, and philanthropist. As Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, he was Warren Buffett's closest partner for over four decades. A Harvard Law School graduate, Munger practiced law before transitioning to investing. His intellectual breadth and commitment to multidisciplinary thinking made him one of the most respected minds in business.

Munger believed that worldly wisdom comes from carrying multiple mental models from various disciplines—psychology, economics, physics, biology, history—and applying them to problems. He famously said that to a man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.

## Core Philosophy

Munger's philosophy centers on **avoiding stupidity rather than seeking brilliance**. He believed that most people fail not because they can't do smart things, but because they repeatedly do dumb things. By identifying and avoiding common errors—what he called "standard stupidities"—you can outperform most people.

His approach combines:
- **Multidisciplinary thinking:** Drawing from many fields
- **Inversion:** Solving problems backwards
- **Elementary worldly wisdom:** Building a latticework of mental models
- **Intellectual humility:** Knowing what you don't know

## Key Principles

### 1. The Latticework of Mental Models
Don't rely on a single framework. Build a toolkit of models from multiple disciplines. Psychology gives you understanding of incentives and biases. Economics gives you supply, demand, and competitive dynamics. Physics gives you critical mass and breakpoints. Use them in combination.

*CEO Application:* When facing a decision, deliberately apply 3-4 different mental models before concluding. Ask: What does psychology say? What does economics say? What does history say?

### 2. Inversion
"Invert, always invert." Instead of asking how to succeed, ask how to fail—then avoid those things. Instead of asking what makes a great company, ask what destroys companies—then don't do those things.

*CEO Application:* Before any major initiative, list all the ways it could fail. Then design the initiative to prevent those failure modes.

### 3. Circle of Competence
Know what you know and what you don't. Stay within your circle of competence, and when you venture outside it, do so cautiously and with expert help.

*CEO Application:* Be honest about where your expertise ends. Hire for your weaknesses. Don't let ego push you into decisions you're not qualified to make.

### 4. The Psychology of Misjudgment
Human minds are prone to systematic errors: incentive-caused bias, social proof, commitment and consistency bias, availability bias, and many others. Study these to avoid them in yourself and to understand others.

*CEO Application:* When your team all agrees too quickly, suspect social proof. When someone advocates passionately for something that benefits them, suspect incentive-caused bias.

### 5. The Importance of Incentives
"Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives." Incentives drive behavior. Get them right, and good things follow naturally. Get them wrong, and no amount of preaching helps.

*CEO Application:* Audit your company's incentive structures quarterly. Are you accidentally incentivizing behavior you don't want?

### 6. Patience and Discipline
The big money is not in the buying and selling but in the waiting. Have the discipline to sit on your hands when there's nothing intelligent to do.

*CEO Application:* Not every problem needs immediate action. Sometimes the best decision is to wait for more information.

### 7. Continuous Learning
Munger read voraciously across every subject. He believed in going to bed smarter than when you woke up, every single day, compounded over a lifetime.

*CEO Application:* Dedicate time daily to reading outside your industry. The best insights come from unexpected places.

## Essential Quotes

> "The big money is not in the buying or selling, but in the waiting."

> "Knowing what you don't know is more useful than being brilliant."

> "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."

> "I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines."

> "Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome."

> "Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean."

> "In my whole life, I have known no wise people who didn't read all the time — none, zero."

> "Take a simple idea and take it seriously."

### Decision-Making
Before any major decision:
