# Andrew Carnegie

> "No man becomes rich unless he enriches others."

## Biography

Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919) emigrated from Scotland to America as a poor child and became the richest man in the world. He built Carnegie Steel Company into the largest and most profitable industrial enterprise of its era, then sold it to J.P. Morgan in 1901 for $480 million (equivalent to over $400 billion today).

What makes Carnegie unique among industrialists is his second act: he gave away 90% of his wealth, funding libraries, universities, and foundations. His essay "The Gospel of Wealth" articulated his philosophy that the wealthy have a moral obligation to distribute their fortunes for the public good.

## Core Philosophy

Carnegie believed that **success comes through surrounding yourself with people smarter than yourself and building systems that outlast any individual**. He was not the best engineer, accountant, or salesman—but he was the best at finding and motivating people who were.

His approach includes:
- **The Mastermind Principle:** Surround yourself with excellence
- **Systematic Thinking:** Build organizations, not just products
- **The Gospel of Wealth:** Wealth carries responsibility
- **Continuous Self-Improvement:** Rise through learning

## Key Principles

### 1. The Mastermind Principle
"It marks a big step in your development when you realize that other people can help you do a better job than you can do alone." Carnegie assembled the greatest team of managers and specialists of his era.

*CEO Application:* Your primary job is to recruit, develop, and retain people better than yourself. Your ego must allow this.

### 2. Concentrated Effort
"Put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch that basket." Carnegie rejected diversification in favor of total focus on mastering one industry.

*CEO Application:* Focus creates excellence. Scattered efforts create mediocrity. What is your one basket?

### 3. Know the Details
Carnegie knew every aspect of steel production—costs, processes, competitors. This wasn't micromanagement; it was informed leadership.

*CEO Application:* You can't lead what you don't understand. Know your business deeply, even as you delegate operations.

### 4. Cost Leadership
Carnegie was obsessed with reducing costs. Lower costs meant lower prices, which meant more volume, which meant more scale advantages. The virtuous cycle built an empire.

*CEO Application:* Understand your cost structure intimately. Competitive advantage often lives in operational excellence.

### 5. Invest in Down Markets
Carnegie expanded aggressively during economic depressions when competitors retrenched, land was cheap, and labor was available. He emerged from each downturn stronger.

*CEO Application:* Economic downturns are opportunities for the strong. Build reserves that let you invest when others retreat.

### 6. Vertical Integration
Carnegie controlled everything from raw ore to finished steel—mines, ships, railroads, and mills. This gave him cost advantages and supply security.

*CEO Application:* Where does controlling more of your value chain create advantage? Where does it create distraction?

### 7. The Gospel of Wealth
"The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced." Carnegie believed wealth was a trust to be used for society's benefit—but directed by the wealth-creator, not government.

*CEO Application:* What is your wealth for? What legacy will you leave beyond financial returns?

### 8. Rise From Humble Origins
Carnegie took pride in his rise from poverty. He believed America's promise was that anyone could succeed through work and self-improvement.

*CEO Application:* Your origin doesn't determine your destination. What disadvantages can you transform into motivation?

## Essential Quotes

> "As I grow older, I pay less attention to what men say. I just watch what they do."

> "You cannot push anyone up the ladder unless he is willing to climb."

> "People who are unable to motivate themselves must be content with mediocrity, no matter how impressive their other talents."

> "The first man gets the oyster, the second man gets the shell."

> "Do your duty and a little more and the future will take care of itself."

> "The average person puts only 25% of his energy and ability into his work. The world takes off its hat to those who put in more than 50% of their capacity."

> "Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results."

> "There is little success where there is little laughter."

> "Concentrate your energies, your thoughts, and your capital."
