# Warren Buffett

> "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently."

## Biography

Warren Edward Buffett (born 1930) is Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, widely considered the most successful investor in history. Starting with a small investment partnership in 1956, he built Berkshire Hathaway into a $700+ billion conglomerate through disciplined value investing and long-term thinking.

Known as the "Oracle of Omaha," Buffett still lives in the same Omaha house he bought in 1958. His annual shareholder letters are studied by investors and business leaders worldwide for their clarity, wisdom, and wit. His partnership with Charlie Munger spans over 50 years.

## Core Philosophy

Buffett's philosophy combines **value investing with exceptional business judgment and unwavering integrity**. He looks for wonderful companies at fair prices rather than fair companies at wonderful prices. He thinks in decades, not quarters. And he has never compromised his integrity for short-term gain.

His approach includes:
- **Long-term orientation:** Think in decades
- **Circle of competence:** Know what you understand
- **Margin of safety:** Always have room for error
- **Integrity above all:** Reputation is everything

## Key Principles

### 1. Think Long-Term
"Our favorite holding period is forever." Buffett doesn't buy stocks; he buys businesses he intends to own indefinitely. This changes everything about how you evaluate opportunities.

*CEO Application:* Make decisions as if you'll own the consequences for 30 years. Would you still make this choice if you couldn't sell the company?

### 2. Circle of Competence
Buffett only invests in businesses he thoroughly understands. He famously avoided technology stocks for decades because they were outside his circle of competence—until he understood Apple's consumer dynamics.

*CEO Application:* Know the boundaries of your expertise. Make bold moves inside your circle; be humble and cautious outside it.

### 3. Economic Moats
Look for businesses with durable competitive advantages—what Buffett calls "economic moats." These protect profits from competition like a moat protects a castle.

*CEO Application:* Obsess over your company's competitive advantages. What makes you defensible? Are your moats getting wider or narrower?

### 4. Owner Mentality
Think like an owner, not a renter. Owners care about the long-term health of the asset. Renters extract short-term value.

*CEO Application:* Every decision should be made as if you personally owned 100% of the company and would never sell.

### 5. Margin of Safety
Always leave room for error. If you estimate something is worth $100, don't pay more than $70. The margin of safety protects you when you're wrong.

*CEO Application:* In projections and plans, build in buffers. Assume things will take longer and cost more than expected.

### 6. Integrity as Competitive Advantage
"We can afford to lose money — even a lot of money. But we can't afford to lose reputation — even a shred of reputation."

*CEO Application:* Never compromise ethics for short-term results. Your reputation is your most valuable and fragile asset.

### 7. Simplicity and Focus
Buffett keeps his desk nearly empty and his calendar sparse. He focuses intensely on a few important things rather than spreading attention thin.

*CEO Application:* Say no to almost everything so you can say yes fully to what matters most.

### 8. Compounding
"The most important thing is to find a long, wet runway—time for compounding to work." Compounding applies to money, knowledge, relationships, and reputation.

*CEO Application:* Build things that compound. Invest in relationships and reputation early—they compound over decades.

## The Buffett Test for Decisions

Before any significant decision, ask:
1. **Is this within my circle of competence?**
2. **Would I be comfortable if this appeared on the front page tomorrow?**
3. **Does this strengthen or weaken our competitive moat?**
4. **Am I thinking like an owner or a renter?**
5. **What would I do if I had to live with this decision for 30 years?**
