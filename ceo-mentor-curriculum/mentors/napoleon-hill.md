# Napoleon Hill

> "Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve."

## Biography

Napoleon Hill (1883-1970) was an American self-help author whose work examined the power of personal beliefs. Commissioned by Andrew Carnegie to interview over 500 successful Americans over 20 years, Hill distilled their common principles into his landmark work, *Think and Grow Rich* (1937), one of the best-selling books of all time.

Hill's work bridged the industrial titans of Carnegie's era and the modern personal development movement. While some of his claims are debated by historians, his principles have influenced generations of entrepreneurs and leaders.

## Core Philosophy

Hill believed that **success begins with a state of mind**—specifically, a burning desire backed by faith, organized planning, and persistent action. He saw the mind as both the greatest asset and greatest obstacle to achievement.

His approach includes:
- **Definiteness of Purpose:** Know exactly what you want
- **The Mastermind:** Align with others for exponential power
- **Auto-suggestion:** Program your subconscious mind
- **Persistence:** The sustained effort that overcomes all obstacles

## Key Principles

### 1. Definiteness of Purpose
"There is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is definiteness of purpose." Without a clear, specific goal, all effort is scattered.

*CEO Application:* Can you state your company's purpose in one sentence? Can every employee? Clarity precedes achievement.

### 2. Burning Desire
Not a wish, not a hope—a burning, obsessive desire backed by total commitment. Hill distinguished between wanting something and being absolutely determined to have it.

*CEO Application:* Check your motivation honestly. Are you playing at this, or are you all in? The market can tell the difference.

### 3. Faith and Auto-Suggestion
"Faith is the starting point of all accumulation of riches." Hill taught that by repeatedly affirming your goals, you program your subconscious to work toward them.

*CEO Application:* What you tell yourself matters. Cultivate belief in your vision through deliberate repetition and visualization.

### 4. The Mastermind Principle
"No two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third, invisible, intangible force which may be likened to a third mind." The mastermind group creates synergy beyond individual capability.

*CEO Application:* Form a personal board of advisors. Meet regularly. The combined intelligence exceeds any individual's.

### 5. Organized Planning
Desire without a plan is daydreaming. Hill emphasized translating goals into concrete steps with deadlines and accountability.

*CEO Application:* Your vision must cascade into quarterly rocks, monthly priorities, and weekly actions. Strategy without execution is hallucination.

### 6. Decision
"The majority of people who fail to accumulate money sufficient for their needs are generally easily influenced by the opinions of others." Successful people decide quickly and change slowly.

*CEO Application:* Make decisions promptly. Gather input, then decide. Indecision erodes organizational confidence.

### 7. Persistence
"Persistence is to the character of man as carbon is to steel." Hill found that temporary defeat was common to all successful people—the difference was they kept going.

*CEO Application:* Expect setbacks. Plan for them. The company will face existential moments; your persistence determines survival.

### 8. The Subconscious Mind
Hill believed the subconscious mind can be directed toward achievement or failure. What you feed it through thoughts and emotions shapes your actions.

*CEO Application:* Curate your mental inputs carefully. What you consume (news, conversations, environment) shapes your subconscious orientation.

### 9. The Brain / Transmutation
Hill taught that thoughts are things with energy that can be transmitted between minds and transformed into physical reality.

*CEO Application:* Your energy is contagious. The state you bring to meetings and interactions shapes outcomes. Manage your mental state deliberately.
