# Mental Models Reference

> "You've got to have models in your head. And you've got to array your experience—both vicarious and direct—on this latticework of models." — Charlie Munger

## The Latticework Concept

Mental models are frameworks for thinking that help you understand how the world works. Munger's key insight: you need models from multiple disciplines, not just one field. A latticework of mental models gives you multiple ways to analyze any situation.

---

## Core Mental Models

### 1. Inversion

**What it is:** Approach problems backward. Instead of asking "How do I succeed?" ask "How would I fail?" Then avoid those things.

**Application:**
- "What would destroy this company?" → Avoid those things
- "What would make this customer leave?" → Don't do those things
- "What would make me a terrible leader?" → Do the opposite

**Munger's advice:** "Invert, always invert. Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward."

---

### 2. Circle of Competence

**What it is:** Know what you know and what you don't know. Stay within your area of genuine expertise for important decisions.

**The three parts:**
1. What you actually understand deeply
2. What you think you understand but don't
3. What you know you don't know

**Application:**
- Map your genuine competencies honestly
- Expand the circle deliberately over time
- When outside your circle, find experts or pass on the decision

**Buffett's test:** "I'm no genius. I'm smart in spots—but I stay around those spots."

---

### 3. Second-Order Thinking

**What it is:** Think beyond immediate consequences. Every action has consequences, and those consequences have consequences.

**The levels:**
- First-order: What happens immediately?
- Second-order: What happens as a result of that?
- Third-order: And then what?

**Application:**
- Before major decisions, map out 2-3 levels of consequences
- Consider unintended effects
- Think about how others will respond to your actions

---

### 4. Probabilistic Thinking

**What it is:** Think in probabilities, not certainties. Assign likelihoods to outcomes rather than treating things as binary.

**Components:**
- Base rates: How often does this typically happen?
- Bayesian updating: How does new information change the odds?
- Expected value: Probability × Outcome

**Application:**
- "There's a 70% chance this works, 30% it doesn't"
- Update estimates as new information arrives
- Make decisions based on expected value, not best-case scenarios

---

### 5. Margin of Safety

**What it is:** Build buffers into your decisions. Don't operate at the edge—leave room for error.

**Application:**
- If you need $1M revenue to break even, plan for $1.3M
- If a project should take 6 months, plan for 9
- If a key hire seems 80% right, that might not be enough

**Buffett's principle:** "When you build a bridge, you insist it can carry 30,000 pounds, but you only drive 10,000-pound trucks across it."

---

### 6. Opportunity Cost

**What it is:** Every choice has a cost—what you give up by not choosing the alternative.

**Application:**
- "If I spend this hour on X, I can't spend it on Y"
- "If I hire this person, I'm not hiring the others"
- "If I invest here, that capital isn't available elsewhere"

**The test:** Compare every opportunity to your best alternative, not to doing nothing.

---

### 7. Incentives

**What it is:** People respond to incentives. To understand behavior, understand the incentive structure.

**Munger's warning:** "Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives."

**Application:**
- What are people rewarded for?
- What behaviors does the system encourage?
- Are incentives aligned with desired outcomes?

**Common mistake:** Assuming people will do what's "right" despite incentives pointing elsewhere.

---

### 8. Mr. Market

**What it is:** The market (and public opinion) is like an emotional neighbor who offers to buy or sell every day. Sometimes his prices are sensible; sometimes they're crazy.

**Application:**
- Don't let Mr. Market's mood determine your actions
- Use his irrationality to your advantage
- Your job is to assess value independently

**Buffett's insight:** "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."

---

## Cognitive Biases to Counteract

### Confirmation Bias
**What it is:** Seeking information that confirms what you already believe.

**Counter:** Actively seek disconfirming evidence. Ask "What would prove me wrong?"

---

### Availability Heuristic
**What it is:** Overweighting recent or vivid information.

**Counter:** Use base rates. Ask "How often does this actually happen?"

---

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
**What it is:** Continuing something because of past investment rather than future value.

**Counter:** Only consider future costs and benefits. "Ignore what you've already spent."

---

### Overconfidence
**What it is:** Being more certain than warranted.

**Counter:** Seek calibration. Track your predictions. Ask others for reality checks.

---

### Social Proof
**What it is:** Doing something because others are doing it.

**Counter:** Think independently. "What would I do if no one else was doing this?"

---

### Authority Bias
**What it is:** Accepting something because an authority said it.

**Counter:** Evaluate the argument, not the source. "Is this actually true?"

---

### Recency Bias
**What it is:** Overweighting recent events.

**Counter:** Look at longer time horizons. "What's the 10-year pattern?"

---

## Applying Mental Models

### The Checklist Approach

Before major decisions, run through relevant models:

1. **Inversion:** What could go wrong? How would this fail?
2. **Circle of competence:** Is this within my understanding?
3. **Second-order effects:** What happens after the immediate result?
4. **Probabilities:** What are the realistic odds?
5. **Margin of safety:** Is there a buffer for error?
6. **Opportunity cost:** What am I giving up?
7. **Incentives:** What behavior does this encourage?
8. **Biases:** What might be distorting my thinking?

### Building Your Latticework

1. **Read broadly** — History, psychology, physics, biology, economics
2. **Extract principles** — What's the underlying model?
3. **Apply across domains** — How does this show up elsewhere?
4. **Test and refine** — Do predictions hold up?
5. **Teach others** — Teaching deepens understanding

## Key Quotes

> "I think it is undeniably true that the human brain must work in models. The trick is to have your brain work better than the other person's brain because it understands the most fundamental models." — Munger

> "We don't have to be smarter than the rest. We have to be more disciplined than the rest." — Buffett

> "Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up." — Munger

> "The best thing a human being can do is to help another human being know more." — Munger
