## The Core Principle

Before you can lead others effectively, you must lead yourself. Character is the foundation of sustainable success. Skills can be learned, but character must be developed.

**Rohn's insight:** "Income seldom exceeds personal development."

**Gandhi's insight:** "Be the change you wish to see in the world."

## Rohn's Philosophy of Personal Development

### The Five Major Pieces

#### 1. Philosophy
Your view of life determines your approach to life.

**Definition:** The sum of what you know and how you think about what you know.

**Development:**
- Read books that challenge and expand thinking
- Seek mentors who model good philosophy
- Reflect on experiences to extract wisdom
- Question assumptions regularly

**Rohn's test:** "Stand guard at the door of your mind."

---

#### 2. Attitude
Your philosophy in action—how you feel about the past, present, and future.

**Components:**
- How you feel about yourself
- How you feel about others
- How you feel about opportunities and challenges
- How you feel about the future

**Development:**
- Control what enters your mind
- Choose response over reaction
- Practice gratitude
- Associate with positive people

---

#### 3. Activity
The daily disciplines that compound into results.

**Principle:** Success is a few simple disciplines practiced every day. Failure is a few errors in judgment repeated every day.

**The formula:**
- Small daily actions × Time = Massive results
- Poor daily choices × Time = Massive problems

**Development:**
- Design your ideal day
- Create non-negotiable daily disciplines
- Track and measure activity
- Adjust based on results

---

#### 4. Results
The measurable outcomes of your philosophy, attitude, and activity.

**Purpose:**
- Results tell the truth about your approach
- They provide feedback for adjustment
- They demonstrate value to others

**Development:**
- Set clear goals
- Measure progress honestly
- Learn from both success and failure
- Celebrate progress while seeking improvement

---

#### 5. Lifestyle
The design of how you live—the reward for success and the motivation for effort.

**Principle:** Design your ideal lifestyle, then build the success to support it.

**Development:**
- Clarify what you want your life to look like
- Understand the cost
- Pay the price in advance
- Enjoy the rewards without guilt

---

### Rohn's Daily Disciplines

**Morning:**
- Rise early
- Read something developmental
- Plan the day
- Exercise the body

**Throughout the day:**
- Work with focus and intention
- Keep commitments
- Serve others
- Learn continuously

**Evening:**
- Reflect on the day
- Journal insights
- Prepare for tomorrow
- Rest adequately

**The compounding effect:** "What's easy to do is also easy not to do."

## Gandhi's Principles of Character

### The Seven Social Sins

Gandhi identified seven things that destroy civilization and character:

1. **Wealth without work**
2. **Pleasure without conscience**
3. **Knowledge without character**
4. **Commerce without morality**
5. **Science without humanity**
6. **Worship without sacrifice**
7. **Politics without principle**

**Application:** Examine your life for any of these. They corrode character and undermine lasting success.

---

### Satya: Truth

**Principle:** Align words, thoughts, and actions with truth.

**Components:**
- Speak truth
- Think truth
- Live truth
- Seek truth

**Application for leaders:**
- Say what you mean and mean what you say
- Don't hide bad news or spin reality
- Admit mistakes openly
- Build trust through consistency

**Gandhi's commitment:** "Truth is my God."

---

### Ahimsa: Non-Violence

**Principle:** Cause no harm—in thought, word, or deed.

**Beyond physical:** Ahimsa extends to:
- Non-violence in speech (no harsh words)
- Non-violence in thought (no ill wishes)
- Non-violence in business (no exploitation)
- Non-violence to self (no self-destruction)

**Application for leaders:**
- Lead through influence, not force
- Win through service, not domination
- Transform adversaries into allies
- Seek solutions that harm no one

---

### Swaraj: Self-Rule

**Principle:** Master yourself before seeking to lead others.

**Components:**
- Control of thoughts
- Control of emotions
- Control of appetites
- Control of behavior

**Application:**
- Daily disciplines demonstrate self-rule
- Leadership authority comes from self-mastery
- External freedom requires internal freedom

**Gandhi's approach:** "I have learnt through bitter experience the one supreme lesson to conserve my anger, and as heat conserved is transmuted into energy, even so our anger controlled can be transmuted into a power which can move the world."

---

### Seva: Service

**Principle:** True fulfillment comes through serving others.

**Gandhi's view:** "The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."

**Application for leaders:**
- Leadership is service, not status
- Success comes from adding value to others
- The highest purpose is serving something larger than yourself

---

### Tapas: Discipline/Austerity

**Principle:** Growth comes through voluntary hardship and discipline.

**Components:**
- Physical discipline (fasting, exercise, simple living)
- Mental discipline (study, meditation, focus)
- Moral discipline (keeping commitments, ethical standards)

**Application:**
- Embrace difficulty as development
- Simplify to focus on what matters
- Build tolerance for discomfort
