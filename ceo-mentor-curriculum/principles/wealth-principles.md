## The Foundation: Definiteness of Purpose

Both Carnegie and Hill agree: wealth creation begins with a clear, definite purpose. Vague desires produce vague results.

**Carnegie:** "The first step to wealth is to concentrate your entire energy, thought, and capital upon the business you are engaged in."

**Hill:** "There is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning desire to possess it."

## Carnegie's Principles of Wealth

### 1. Concentration

**Principle:** Put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket.

**Application:**
- Focus your energy on one primary enterprise
- Don't diversify attention across too many ventures
- Master one domain before expanding

**Carnegie's view:** "The concerns which fail are those which have scattered their capital... They have investments in this, that and the other."

---

### 2. The Mastermind

**Principle:** Surround yourself with people smarter than you in areas you need.

**Application:**
- Build a team of specialists
- Hire for strengths you lack
- Create collaborative intelligence

**Carnegie's epitaph:** "Here lies a man who knew how to enlist in his service better men than himself."

---

### 3. Organized Knowledge

**Principle:** Knowledge is power only when organized and directed toward a definite end.

**Application:**
- Systematize what you know
- Create processes from insights
- Turn knowledge into action

---

### 4. Surplus Reinvestment

**Principle:** Reinvest profits into the enterprise for growth.

**Application:**
- Live below your means during building phase
- Compound returns through reinvestment
- Delay consumption for future wealth

---

### 5. The Gospel of Wealth

**Principle:** With wealth comes responsibility.

**Three modes of disposing surplus wealth:**
1. Leave it to heirs (least worthy)
2. Leave it for public purposes at death (better)
3. Administer it for the public good during life (best)

**Carnegie's belief:** "The man who dies rich, dies disgraced."
