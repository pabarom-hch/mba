## Key Principles Summary

### From Carnegie

1. **Know costs precisely.** You can't manage what you don't measure.

2. **Classify costs correctly.** Investment, necessary, or waste—treat each appropriately.

3. **Build the flywheel.** Cost advantage creates self-reinforcing cycle.

4. **Improve continuously.** Yesterday's best is today's baseline.

5. **Invest in technology.** Structural advantage compounds.

6. **Build cost culture.** Make efficiency everyone's job.

### The Integration

**Knowledge + Classification + Flywheel + Improvement + Technology + Culture = Cost Leadership**

Each element reinforces the others. Together, they create sustainable competitive advantage.

## Key Quote for the Week

> "Cut the prices; scoop the market; run the mills full."

This is cost leadership in action: Cut prices (because you have cost advantage) → Scoop the market (capture share) → Run full (maximize volume) → Which drives more cost advantage. The flywheel in one sentence. This is how cost leaders dominate markets.

## Next Week Preview

**Week 19: The Gospel of Wealth**

Carnegie didn't just build wealth—he developed a philosophy about what wealth was for. His essay "The Gospel of Wealth" argued that the wealthy have a responsibility to distribute their fortune for public good during their lifetime. Next week explores this philosophy and asks: what is your wealth ultimately for?
