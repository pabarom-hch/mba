# Day 7: Weekly Integration — The Complete Delegation Framework

**Week 16 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

> "I never give detailed instructions. I tell them what I want and let them find their own way."

---

## The Week in Review

This week explored delegation and trust—Carnegie's essential skills for building beyond personal capacity.

| Day | Topic | Core Concept |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Delegation as Multiplication | Personal capacity is finite; through others, impact is unlimited |
| 2 | Trust Before Delegation | Without trust, you delegate tasks but not authority |
| 3 | Authority, Not Just Tasks | Real delegation gives decision rights, not just work |
| 4 | The Accountability Balance | Tight on outcomes, loose on methods |
| 5 | Letting Go of Credit | Credit-need kills effective delegation |
| 6 | Delegation and Development | Every delegation is a development opportunity |

**3. Focus on what only you can do**
- Strategy
- Capital allocation
- Key relationships
- Major decisions

**4. Build through delegation**
- Develop leaders constantly
- Create successors
- Build lasting organization

### The Results

**What Carnegie achieved through delegation:**
- Empire that ran without him
- Months in Scotland while empire grew
- Leaders developed continuously
- Organization that outlasted him

## The CEO's Delegation Journey

### Stage 1: Doing

**The trap:**
- Doing everything yourself
- No delegation
- Limited capacity
- Burnout path

### Stage 2: Task Delegation

**The improvement:**

- Being the bottleneck
- Limited scale

### Stage 3: Authority Delegation

**The breakthrough:**
- Giving real authority
- Trusting judgment
- Focusing on outcomes
- Beginning to scale

### Stage 4: Organization Building

**The destination:**
- Delegation as norm
- Leaders throughout
- You focused on what matters
- Organization scales beyond you

### Where Are You?

**Assess honestly:**
- Which stage describes you?
- What's keeping you there?
- What would move you forward?
- What's the first step?

## Key Principles Summary

### From Carnegie

1. **Delegation is multiplication.** Your personal capacity is finite. Through others, impact is unlimited.

2. **Trust precedes delegation.** Build it incrementally. Verify it continuously. Without it, delegation fails.

3. **Give authority, not just tasks.** Real delegation includes decision rights, resources, and accountability.

4. **Balance autonomy and accountability.** Tight on outcomes, loose on methods. Check in without micromanaging.

5. **Let go of credit.** Give it generously. Find satisfaction in their success. The less you need, the more you get.

6. **Delegate for development.** Every delegation is a learning opportunity. Use it intentionally.

### The Integration

**Trust + Authority + Accountability + Development = Multiplication**

- Without trust: Micromanagement
- Without authority: Pseudo-delegation
- Without accountability: Abdication
- Without development focus: Wasted opportunity

## Key Quote for the Week

> "I never give detailed instructions. I tell them what I want and let them find their own way."

This is Carnegie's delegation philosophy in one sentence. Tell them what you want (outcomes). Let them find their own way (methods). Trust them (authority). Hold them accountable (results). Develop them (growth). This is how empires are built.

## Next Week Preview

Carnegie didn't just make steel—he owned the iron ore, coal, railroads, and ships. Next week explores when and how to control more of your value chain, and when integration is a distraction.
