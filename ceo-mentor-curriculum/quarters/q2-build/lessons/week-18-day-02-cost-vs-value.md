# Day 2: Cost vs. Value

**Week 18 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

## The Core Insight

Not all costs are equal. Some costs create value—they're investments that build capability, competitive advantage, and future earnings. Other costs are pure waste—they deliver nothing and should be eliminated. And some are necessary operations—required to function but not creating advantage.

The discipline of cost leadership distinguishes between these categories and treats each appropriately.

---

## The Three Categories

### Value-Creating Investments

**What they are:**
- Costs that build competitive advantage
- Spending that creates future earnings
- Investments in capability
- Strategic positioning costs

**Examples:**
- R&D that creates new products
- Technology that reduces future costs
- Training that builds capability
- Quality systems that create differentiation

**How to treat them:**
- Invest appropriately
- Measure return
- Protect from arbitrary cuts
- Increase when ROI is positive

### Necessary Operations

**What they are:**
- Required to function
- Don't create advantage
- Must be done, not differentiated
- Table stakes

**Examples:**
- Basic administration
- Compliance requirements
- Standard facilities
- Non-differentiated processes

**How to treat them:**
- Make efficient
- Minimize cost
- Outsource if others can do better
- Don't over-invest

### Pure Waste

**What it is:**
- Delivers no value
- Often invisible or accepted
- Accumulated over time
- Should be eliminated

**Examples:**
- Unnecessary meetings
- Redundant processes
- Obsolete systems
- Bureaucratic overhead

**How to treat it:**
- Identify ruthlessly
- Eliminate completely
- Prevent recurrence
- Challenge all assumptions

## The Classification Challenge

### Why It's Hard

**Everything claims to be value-creating:**
- Every department defends its budget
- Every activity claims importance
- Every cost has a justification
- Waste disguises itself

**The temptation:**
- Cut across the board
- Treat all costs equally
- Miss the distinction
- Damage value-creating investments

### The Test Questions

**For any cost, ask:**
1. Does this create competitive advantage?
2. Would customers notice if we stopped?
3. Does this build future capability?
4. Would competitors be affected if they had this and we didn't?
5. Is the return measurable and positive?

**Answers reveal category:**
- Yes to most = Value-creating
- No to most, but necessary to function = Necessary operations
- No to all = Waste

## Carnegie's Distinction

### Where He Invested

**Value-creating costs:**
- Latest technology for production
- Best engineers and managers
- Vertical integration for cost advantage
- Quality improvements

**His view:**
- These costs created advantage
- Competitors couldn't match
- Investment returned multiples
- Worth paying for

### Where He Was Ruthless

**Waste elimination:**
- Unnecessary overhead
- Inefficient processes
- Excess capacity
- Non-performing people

**His view:**
- These costs drained
- Created no value
- Should be eliminated
- No room for sentiment

### Where He Was Efficient

**Necessary operations:**
- Basic administration
- Standard processes
- Required functions
- Non-differentiated activities

**His view:**
- Do efficiently
- Don't over-invest
- Keep lean
- Focus resources on value creation

## The Investment Mindset

### Costs as Investments

**Some costs are investments:**
- Spend now, return later
- Create capability
- Build advantage
- Compound over time

**These should be evaluated like investments:**
- What's the return?
- What's the timeframe?
- What's the risk?
- What's the opportunity cost?

### The Danger of Cost Cutting

**Indiscriminate cutting damages:**
- Cuts to R&D hurt future
- Cuts to training hurt capability
- Cuts to quality hurt brand
- Cuts to people hurt culture

**The discipline:**
- Classify before cutting
- Protect investments
- Cut waste ruthlessly
- Make operations efficient

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Investment Protected

A CEO who distinguished wisely:

**The situation:**
- Pressure to cut costs
- All areas targeted equally
- Across-the-board cuts proposed

**The distinction:**
- Identified value-creating investments
- Protected R&D and key capabilities
- Cut waste aggressively
- Made operations efficient

**The result:**
- Short-term costs reduced
- Long-term capability preserved
- Competitors who cut investments fell behind
- Advantage maintained

**The lesson:** Classification enables intelligent cost management.

### Case 2: The Investment Destroyed

A CEO who cut indiscriminately:

**The situation:**
- Pressure to cut costs
- All costs treated equally
- Deep cuts everywhere

**What happened:**
- R&D gutted
- Training eliminated
- Quality suffered
- Best people left

**The result:**
- Short-term savings achieved
- Long-term capability destroyed
- Competitors gained ground
- Recovery took years

**The lesson:** Indiscriminate cutting destroys value.

### Case 3: The Waste Discovered

A company that found hidden waste:

**The investigation:**
- Classified all costs
- Challenged everything
- Asked hard questions
- Traced value creation

**What was found:**
- 15% of costs were pure waste
- Accumulated over years
- No one questioned
- Eliminating freed resources

**The result:**
- Waste eliminated
- Resources freed
- Investments increased
- Competitive position improved

**The lesson:** Waste hides in plain sight.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Cost Classification

**Classify your major costs:**

| Cost Category | $ Amount | Classification | Evidence |
|---------------|----------|----------------|----------|
| | | V/N/W | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

(V = Value-creating, N = Necessary, W = Waste)

### Application 2: Investment Assessment

**For costs classified as value-creating:**

| Investment | Current Spend | Return Achieved | Increase/Maintain/Decrease |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 3: Waste Identification

**Hunt for waste:**

| Area | Potential Waste | Evidence It's Waste | Action |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 4: Efficiency Opportunity

**For necessary operations:**

| Operation | Current Cost | Benchmark | Efficiency Opportunity |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## The Classification Process

### Step 1: Inventory All Costs

**List everything:**
- All cost categories
- All spending areas
- All activities
- All investments

### Step 2: Apply the Test

**For each cost, ask:**
- Does this create competitive advantage?
- Does this build future capability?
- Is this necessary to function?
- Is the return positive?

### Step 3: Classify

**Assign category:**
- Value-creating investment
- Necessary operations
- Waste

### Step 4: Treat Appropriately

**Based on classification:**
- Investments: Evaluate ROI, potentially increase
- Operations: Make efficient, minimize
- Waste: Eliminate

## Reflection Questions

1. How do you currently distinguish between value-creating costs and waste?

2. Are you investing enough in things that create competitive advantage?

3. What waste exists that you've been tolerating?

4. If you had to cut 20%, how would you protect value-creating investments?

5. What would Carnegie say about your cost classification?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The average person puts only 25% of his energy and ability into his work."

This isn't just about people—it's about costs. The average dollar spent doesn't create value. Some investments deliver 4x return. Some costs are pure waste. The discipline of cost leadership is knowing which is which and treating them accordingly.
