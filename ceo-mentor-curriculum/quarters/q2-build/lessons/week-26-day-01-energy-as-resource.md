# Day 1: Energy as Resource

**Week 26 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Napoleon Hill**

> "The person who can channel their emotions into their work is unbeatable."

## The Core Insight

Energy is the raw material of achievement. Physical energy, mental energy, emotional energy, creative energy—these are the inputs you convert into results. Hill understood that the CEO's job is partly an energy management job: ensuring sufficient energy exists and directing it toward purpose.

Those who channel energy well are unbeatable. Those who scatter it accomplish little.

|-------------|------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Physical | | | |
| Mental | | | |
| Emotional | | | |
| Creative | | | |

### Application 2: Leakage Identification

**Identify your energy leaks:**

| Leak Type | Specific Leaks | Energy Cost (H/M/L) | Action |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Distraction | | | |
| Conflict | | | |
| Worry | | | |
| Inefficiency | | | |

### Application 3: Renewal Assessment

**Assess your renewal practices:**

## Energy and Purpose

### The Connection

**Purpose organizes energy:**
- When purpose is clear, energy has direction
- Vague purpose = scattered energy
- Clear purpose = focused energy
- Purpose is the organizer

**Energy enables purpose:**
- No energy, no action
- Low energy, slow progress
- High energy, fast progress
- Energy is the fuel

### The Practice

**Daily energy management:**
- Begin day connected to purpose
- Direct energy toward purpose throughout
- Protect from leakage
- Renew for tomorrow

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The person who can channel their emotions into their work is unbeatable."

Not the person with the most energy. Not the smartest. Not the luckiest. The one who can channel—direct, focus, align—their energy into their work. That's who becomes unbeatable. Channel, not scatter. Direct, not dissipate. Align, not fragment. That's the energy game.
