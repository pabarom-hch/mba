**Week 19 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

> "The problem of our age is the proper administration of wealth."

## The Core Insight

Wealth doesn't just change what you have—it changes who you become. The pursuit and possession of wealth shapes character in profound ways, some positive, some negative. Carnegie understood that wealth was a test of character, not just a measure of success.

How you pursue wealth, how you hold it, and how you use it reveals and shapes who you are.

## How Wealth Changes Character

### The Potential Corruptions

**Arrogance:**
- Success breeds confidence
- Confidence can become arrogance
- Wealth can suggest superiority
- Position can corrupt humility

**Isolation:**
- Wealth creates separation
- Different problems than others
- Fewer who can relate
- Distance from reality

**Entitlement:**
- What was earned feels deserved
- Deserving becomes expecting
- Expecting becomes demanding
- Gratitude diminishes

**Hardness:**
- Tough decisions required
- Sentimentality is costly
- Empathy can soften
- Hardness protects

### The Potential Developments

**Capability:**
- Wealth requires building
- Building develops skills
- Skills create capability
- Capability enables impact

**Perspective:**
- Different vantage point
- See systems others miss
- Understand complexity
- Appreciate opportunity

**Generosity:**
- Resources enable giving
- Giving develops generosity
- Generosity creates connection
- Connection enriches character

**Responsibility:**
- Capacity creates obligation
- Obligation develops maturity

## The Character Test

### Wealth as Revealer

**What wealth reveals:**
- Core values (what you do with it)
- True priorities (where you focus)
- Real character (how you treat others)
- Underlying motivations (why you accumulate)

**Carnegie's observation:**
- How someone uses wealth reveals who they are
- Generosity or hoarding
- Service or domination
- Legacy or consumption

### Wealth as Shaper

**What wealth shapes:**
- Daily habits (how you spend time)
- Relationships (who you're with)
- Concerns (what you worry about)
- Identity (how you see yourself)

**The danger:**
- Wealth shapes you whether you want it to or not
- Without intention, default is corruption
- Character requires active maintenance
- Wealth makes maintenance harder

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Carnegie's Character Journey

How wealth affected Carnegie:

**The early years:**
- Intense focus on building
- Competitive and driven
- Tough on competitors
- Controversial labor practices

**The later years:**
- Shifted to distribution
- Developed philosophy of responsibility
- Became focused on legacy
- Character evolved

**The lesson:** Character can develop through and after accumulation.

### Case 2: The Corrupted Builder

A successful entrepreneur whose character corrupted:

**The pattern:**
- Early humility gave way to arrogance
- Relationships became transactional
- Isolation increased
- Entitlement grew

**The result:**
- Wealthy but alone

**The lesson:** Without guard rails, wealth corrupts.

### Case 3: The Protected Character

An entrepreneur who maintained character:

**The approach:**

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The problem of our age is the proper administration of wealth."

The problem isn't wealth itself—it's what to do with it. And what you do with wealth reveals and shapes your character. The "proper administration" is both external (how you distribute) and internal (who you become in the process).
