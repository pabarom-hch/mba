**Week 14 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

## The Core Insight

The mastermind principle extends beyond your immediate team. No CEO has all the perspectives, expertise, and wisdom they need. External masterminds—advisors, peers, mentors, networks—expand your collective intelligence beyond your organization's walls.

The deliberate CEO cultivates multiple masterminds: internal (leadership team), external (advisors and peers), and personal (mentors and confidants).

## Why External Masterminds Matter

## Key Quote for the Day

> "As I grow older, I pay less attention to what men say. I just watch what they do."

External masterminds extend your collective intelligence beyond your organization. They provide perspective you can't get internally, challenge you in ways your team can't, and connect you to wisdom and networks that multiply your capability. Build them deliberately.
