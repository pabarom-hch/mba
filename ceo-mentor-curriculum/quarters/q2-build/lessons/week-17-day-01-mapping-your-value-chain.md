# Day 1: Mapping Your Value Chain

**Week 17 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

> "Concentrate your energies, your thoughts and your capital."

## The Core Insight

Before you can decide what to integrate, you must understand your value chain—the complete sequence of activities from raw inputs to final customer. Carnegie didn't accidentally own iron mines and railroads; he systematically mapped where value was created and where he was vulnerable.

The CEO who understands their value chain sees where power lies, where margins accumulate, and where strategic control creates advantage.

## What Is a Value Chain

### The Basic Concept

**A value chain is:**
- Every step from raw materials to end customer
- Each transformation that adds value
- All the participants involved
- The flow of goods, money, and information

**Why it matters:**
- Value is distributed across the chain
- Power is distributed (often unevenly)
- Vulnerability exists where you're dependent
- Opportunity exists where you could control more

### Carnegie's Value Chain

**The steel industry chain:**
- Iron ore deposits
- Mining operations
- Rail transport
- Coal for fuel
- Coke production
- Steel manufacturing
- Rail transport (finished goods)
- End customers

**What Carnegie controlled:**
- Eventually: almost everything
- Iron mines, coal mines
- Transportation (railroads, ships)
- Steel mills
- Distribution

**What this meant:**
- Cost advantage (no middleman margins)
- Supply security (no shutoffs)
- Speed (no dependencies)
- Control (his destiny was his own)

## Mapping Your Value Chain

### Step 1: Identify All Steps

**List every transformation:**
- From raw materials
- Through each value-adding step
- To final delivery to customer
- Include services, not just products

**Questions to ask:**
- What has to happen before you add value?
- What happens after you're done?
- Who touches the product/service along the way?
- What information flows are required?

### Step 2: Identify Control at Each Step

**For each step, who controls it?**
- You (fully control)
- Partner (shared control)
- Supplier (they control)
- Market (commodity)

**Questions to ask:**
- Do you own this step?
- Do you depend on a specific party?
- Are there alternatives?
- Who has power here?

### Step 3: Assess Vulnerability

**Where are you vulnerable?**
- Single source dependencies
- Supplier power points
- Bottlenecks
- Quality dependencies

**Questions to ask:**
- What if this supplier failed?
- What if they raised prices?
- What if quality dropped?
- What if they served competitors first?

### Step 4: Identify Strategic Value

**Where is strategic value created?**
- Differentiation points
- Margin concentration
- Customer relationship
- Proprietary technology

**Questions to ask:**
- Where is the most margin in this chain?
- Where is differentiation created?
- Where does the customer relationship reside?
- Where is proprietary advantage built?

## Types of Value Chain Positions

### Upstream (Suppliers)

**What it includes:**
- Raw materials
- Components
- Technology inputs
- Services that enable your work

**Key questions:**
- Are you dependent on specific suppliers?
- Do they have power over you?
- Could you be disrupted?
- Is there value in controlling this?

### Your Core (Where You Operate)

**What it includes:**
- Your primary value creation
- What you do for customers
- Your main activity

**Key questions:**
- Is this where the most value is?
- Are you in the right place in the chain?
- Could you expand up or down?
- Where is your differentiation?

### Downstream (Customers and Distribution)

**What it includes:**
- Distribution channels
- Customer relationship
- Delivery mechanisms
- After-sale services

**Key questions:**
- Who owns the customer relationship?
- Are you dependent on channels?
- Could you go direct?
- Is there value in controlling this?

## The Power Analysis

### Where Does Power Concentrate?

**Power in value chains concentrates where:**
- Few alternatives exist
- Switching costs are high
- Differentiation is strong
- Information asymmetry exists
- Scale economies are significant

**Questions to ask:**
- Who has the power in your chain?
- Why do they have it?
- How does it affect you?
- Could the power balance shift?

### Carnegie's Power Move

**What he understood:**
- Iron ore and coal were essential inputs
- Transportation was a potential bottleneck
- Suppliers could gain power over him
- Control eliminated that vulnerability

**What he did:**
- Acquired upstream (mines)
- Acquired transport (railroads, ships)
- Eliminated dependencies
- Captured margin that went to suppliers

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Dependent Company

A manufacturer vulnerable to its value chain:

**The situation:**
- Dependent on single supplier for key component
- Supplier raised prices repeatedly
- No alternatives available
- Captive to supplier power

**The result:**
- Margin erosion
- Vulnerability to disruption
- Strategic weakness
- Eventually acquired by supplier

**The lesson:** Understand your vulnerabilities before they hurt you.

### Case 2: The Integrated Competitor

A competitor who integrated:

**What they did:**
- Acquired key supplier
- Secured input costs
- Potentially limited competitor access
- Built structural advantage

**What happened:**
- Cost advantage created
- Supply security achieved
- Competitors now at disadvantage
- Market position strengthened

**The lesson:** Integration can shift competitive dynamics.

### Case 3: The Value Chain Shift

An industry where value moved:

**What happened:**
- Historically, value was in manufacturing
- Value shifted to distribution
- Those who controlled customers won
- Manufacturers commoditized

**The winners:**
- Those who saw it coming
- Those who moved toward value
- Those who controlled customer relationship
- Those who weren't stuck upstream

**The lesson:** Know where value is going, not just where it is.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Value Chain Map

**Draw your value chain:**

| Step | Activity | Who Controls | Strategic Importance | Vulnerability |
|------|----------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1 | | You/Partner/Supplier | H/M/L | H/M/L |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

### Application 2: Vulnerability Assessment

**Assess your dependencies:**

| Dependency | Single Source? | Alternative? | Impact if Disrupted | Risk Level |
|------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|------------|
| | Y/N | | | H/M/L |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

### Application 3: Power Analysis

**Analyze power distribution:**

| Entity | Their Power Over You | Your Power Over Them | Net Position |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| | H/M/L | H/M/L | +/-/= |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 4: Value Location

**Where is value concentrated?**

| Step | Margin Level | Differentiation | Future Trend |
|------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| | H/M/L | H/M/L | ↑/→/↓ |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Concentrate your energies, your thoughts and your capital."

You can only concentrate effectively when you understand where in the value chain you operate, where value is created, and where you're vulnerable. Map your chain. Know your position. Understand the power dynamics. This is the foundation for strategic choices about integration.
