# Day 6: Giving While Living

**Week 19 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

> "The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced."

---

## The Core Insight

Carnegie didn't just believe in giving—he believed in giving while living. His most provocative claim was that a person who dies rich has failed. The wealthy have a duty to distribute their fortune during their lifetime, not leave it to heirs or estate plans.

Giving while living is fundamentally different from giving after death. The impact, the learning, the satisfaction—all require presence.

## The Case for Living Giving

### You Can Direct It

**When you're alive:**
- You can choose recipients carefully
- You can monitor impact
- You can adjust based on results
- You can apply your judgment

**When you're gone:**
- Others make decisions
- They may not share your values
- They can't consult you
- Intentions get lost in translation

### You Can Learn and Improve

**When you're alive:**
- You see what works
- You learn from failures
- You improve your approach
- You compound your impact

**When you're gone:**
- No feedback loop
- No learning
- No improvement
- One-time decisions

### You Experience the Impact

**When you're alive:**
- You see the results
- You feel the satisfaction
- You witness the change
- You participate in meaning

**When you're gone:**
- You experience nothing
- Others may benefit, but not you
- The joy belongs to others
- Connection is impossible

### You Model Behavior

**When you're alive:**
- Others see your giving
- You influence by example
- You normalize generosity
- You create culture

**When you're gone:**
- Example is historical
- Influence is limited
- Modeling is impossible
- Culture shifts without you

## Carnegie's Radical Position

### "Dies Disgraced"

**His argument:**
- The wealthy are trustees of their fortune
- Trustees have duty to distribute
- Hoarding until death is failure
- Death with wealth is disgrace

**His reasoning:**
- You can give better than your heirs
- Your judgment is worth something
- Delay serves no purpose
- The need exists now

### The Exceptions He Allowed

**Acceptable delay:**
- Moderate provision for family
- Time to give wisely
- Building institutions properly
- Ensuring sustainability

**Unacceptable delay:**
- Hoarding for hoarding's sake
- Fear of having less
- Control beyond the grave
- Unlimited provision for heirs

### What He Did

**Carnegie's giving:**
- Gave away 90% of his fortune
- Started giving in his 50s
- Accelerated giving after selling business
- Died with modest resources

**His satisfaction:**
- "The rich man who dies rich dies disgraced"
- He died without disgrace
- He witnessed his impact
- He directed his legacy

## What You Can Give Now

### Money

**The obvious:**
- Funds for causes
- Endowments for institutions
- Investments in people
- Resources for impact

**The challenge:**
- How much while still building?
- What percentage is right?
- When to accelerate?
- How to give wisely?

### Time

**Often more valuable:**
- Attention is scarce
- Your time is worth much
- Direct involvement creates impact
- Time is finite

**What time can do:**
- Mentorship
- Board service
- Direct involvement
- Teaching and advising

### Expertise

**What you know:**
- Business knowledge
- Industry insight
- Problem-solving ability
- Leadership capability

**How to share:**
- Advising
- Coaching
- Consulting pro bono
- Teaching

### Access

**What you have:**
- Network
- Connections
- Relationships
- Doors that open for you

**How to share:**
- Introductions

## The Timing Question

### When to Start

**Carnegie's answer:**
- Start as soon as you can give wisely
- Don't wait for perfect conditions
- Begin even while building
- Accelerate when possible

**The practical answer:**
- Give something now
- Increase over time
- Major giving when capacity allows
- Complete giving before death

### How Much Now

**Principles:**
- Enough to learn
- Enough to matter
- Not so much it undermines building
- More as building succeeds

**The balance:**
- Current needs vs. giving capacity
- Building more vs. giving now
- Family provision vs. public benefit
- Judgment, not formula

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Carnegie's Distribution Journey

How Carnegie gave while living:

**The timeline:**
- 1889: Published "Gospel of Wealth"
- 1890s: Began systematic giving
- 1901: Sold Carnegie Steel
- 1901-1919: Gave away $350+ million

**The approach:**
- Started while still building
- Accelerated after sale
- Directed personally
- Witnessed impact

**The result:**
- Experienced satisfaction
- Improved giving over time
- Created lasting institutions
- Died without disgrace

**The lesson:** Living giving allows learning and direction.

### Case 2: The Posthumous Giver

A wealthy person who waited until death:

**Their approach:**
- Accumulated throughout life
- Planned to give through estate
- Left detailed instructions
- Died very wealthy

**What happened:**
- Heirs contested the will
- Executors made different choices
- Intentions were diluted
- Much went to lawyers and taxes

**The lesson:** Posthumous giving is unpredictable and disconnected.

### Case 3: The Integrated Giver

A modern entrepreneur who gives while building:

**Their approach:**
- Gave from the beginning
- Increased percentage over time
- Involved in giving personally
- Learned and improved

**The result:**
- Built relationships with recipients
- Improved impact over time

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced."

The most provocative statement in the Gospel of Wealth. Not "the man who never gets rich" or "the man who fails at business"—the man who dies rich. Carnegie believed the failure wasn't in not accumulating, but in not distributing. What will you do with what you have while you can still do it?

## Tomorrow's Preview

**Day 7** integrates the week's lessons into Carnegie's complete philosophy of wealth as responsibility, and transitions to Napoleon Hill.
