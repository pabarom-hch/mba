# Day 5: Developing Excellence

**Week 15 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

> "The average person puts only 25% of his energy and ability into his work. The world takes off its hat to those who put in more than 50% of their capacity."

## The Core Insight

Excellence isn't static. It must be developed, cultivated, and grown. The CEO who invests in developing people multiplies capability over time. Each person who grows expands what the organization can achieve.

Development isn't just a benefit—it's a strategic imperative. It retains excellent people, builds organizational capability, and creates the leaders of tomorrow.

- Organizational gaps

**Create development understanding:**

- Learning through doing

### 3. Provide Support

**Support enables challenge:**

- Resources and tools
- Safety to fail
- Feedback for learning

**The balance:**
- Enough support to succeed
- Not so much support that there's no stretch
- Available but not hovering
- Guiding but not doing

### 4. Create Learning Opportunities

**Formal development:**
- Training and education
- Courses and programs
- Conferences and learning
- Structured development

**Experiential development:**
- Stretch assignments
- Cross-functional exposure

- Learning through doing

**Relational development:**
- Mentorship
- Coaching

- Feedback

### 5. Measure and Adjust

**Adjust approach:**

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The average person puts only 25% of his energy and ability into his work. The world takes off its hat to those who put in more than 50% of their capacity."

Development unlocks potential. Most people aren't fully utilized—their capability exceeds their current contribution. The CEO who develops people releases that potential, multiplies capability, and creates something that grows.
