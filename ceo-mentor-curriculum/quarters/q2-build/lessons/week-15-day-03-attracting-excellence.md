# Day 3: Attracting Excellence

**Week 15 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

> "People who are unable to motivate themselves must be content with mediocrity, no matter how impressive their other talents."

## The Core Insight

Excellent people have options. They choose where to invest their talents. To attract excellence, you must offer something compelling—a mission worth pursuing, an opportunity worth taking, growth worth having, and an environment worth inhabiting.

The question isn't "How do I find excellent people?" It's "Why would excellent people choose me?"

## Why Excellent People Have Options

### The Talent Asymmetry

**Excellent people:**
- Are in demand everywhere
- Receive constant opportunities
- Can choose their path
- Don't need you

**Average people:**
- Compete for positions
- Take what's offered
- Have limited choices
- Need opportunities

**The implication:**
- You're not selecting them; they're selecting you
- You must attract, not just recruit
- You must be chosen, not just choose

### What Excellent People Want

**Beyond compensation:**
- Mission worth pursuing
- Challenge worth engaging
- Growth worth having
- People worth joining
- Culture worth inhabiting

**The hierarchy:**
- Compensation is table stakes
- Purpose provides meaning
- Growth provides trajectory
- Culture provides experience
- Leadership provides trust
