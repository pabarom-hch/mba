**Week 16 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

## The Core Insight

Delegation isn't just about your capacity—it's about their development. Every delegation is a learning opportunity. Every stretch assignment builds capability. Every authority given develops judgment.

The CEO who delegates thoughtfully creates leaders. The one who hoards creates followers. Your delegation strategy is your development strategy.

## Delegation as Development Vehicle

### The Traditional View

**Delegation for capacity:**
- You have too much to do
- You give some away
- They execute
- You do more important things

**What this misses:**
- Development opportunity
- Leadership building
- Succession planning
- Organizational capability

### The Development View

**Delegation for growth:**
- You have development to do
- You create stretch opportunities
- They learn through doing
- Organization builds capability

**What this adds:**
- Leaders developed
- Capability multiplied
- Succession created
- Organization strengthened

---

## The Development Delegation Framework

### Step 1: Assess Development Needs

**For each person:**
- What capabilities do they need?
- What experiences are missing?
- What stretch would help?
- What's the next level?

### Step 2: Match Delegation to Need

**Intentional assignment:**
- This delegation builds X capability
- This experience fills Y gap
- This authority develops Z judgment
- This challenge creates growth

### Step 3: Provide Appropriate Support

**Development requires support:**
- Coaching before and during
- Safety to fail
- Feedback for learning
- Resources for success

### Step 4: Debrief and Consolidate

**Learning requires reflection:**
- What happened?
- What did you learn?
- What would you do differently?
- How will you apply this?

---

## Stretch Assignments

### What They Are

**Stretch assignments:**
- Beyond current capability
- Require new learning
- Involve some risk
- Create growth through challenge

**Not:**
- Doable without effort
- Within comfort zone
- No learning required
- Safe and easy

### Designing Stretch

**The right level of stretch:**
- Challenging but achievable
- Requires growth
- Has support available
- Not set up to fail

**Too much stretch:**
- Overwhelming
- Likely to fail
- Discouraging
- Damaging

**Too little stretch:**
- No development
- No challenge
- No growth
- Wasted opportunity

### The Stretch-Support Balance

**High stretch, high support:**
- Challenging assignment
- Coaching available
- Safety net exists
- Growth happens

**High stretch, low support:**
- Set up to fail
- Overwhelming
- Damaging
- Burned out or gone

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Carnegie's Leadership Factory

How Carnegie developed leaders through delegation:

**His approach:**
- Gave major responsibilities to promising people
- Let them make (and learn from) mistakes
- Provided mentorship and support
- Rewarded success with more opportunity

**The result:**
- Constant leadership development
- Deep bench of capable managers
- Many became industry leaders themselves
- Legacy extended beyond his tenure

**The lesson:** Delegation develops leaders.

### Case 2: The Missed Development

A CEO who didn't use delegation for development:

**The pattern:**
- Delegated for capacity only
- Gave tasks, not development
- No stretch, no support
- Transactional delegation

**The result:**
- No leadership development
- No succession depth
- Capable people left
- Organization limited

**The lesson:** Delegation without development intention wastes opportunity.

### Case 3: The Development Delegation

A CEO who delegated for development:

**The approach:**
- Matched assignments to development needs
- Provided coaching support
- Debriefed learnings
- Created progression

**The result:**
- Leaders developed throughout
- Strong succession bench
- People loyal and growing
- Organization capability expanded

**The lesson:** Intentional development delegation builds organizations.

|--------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 2: Delegation-Development Matching

**Match delegations to needs:**

| Person | Development Need | Delegation Opportunity | How It Develops |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 3: Stretch-Support Planning

**For planned stretch assignments:**

| Assignment | Person | Stretch Level | Support Plan |
|------------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| | | H/M/L | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 4: Debrief Calendar

**Schedule development debriefs:**

| Person | Assignment | Debrief Date | Key Questions |
|--------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

## The Coaching Approach

### Before the Delegation

**Set up for development:**
- This is a development opportunity
- Here's what you'll learn
- Here's the support available
- Here's what success looks like

### During the Delegation

**Coaching along the way:**
- Check in on learning, not just progress
- Ask about challenges
- Offer guidance, not answers
- Create space for struggle

### After the Delegation

**Consolidate the learning:**
- What happened?
- What did you learn?
- What would you do differently?
- How will you apply this going forward?

---

## Development Through Failure

### When They Fail

**The opportunity:**
- Failure teaches more than success
- This is development happening
- The question is how to maximize learning

**Your response:**
- Don't rescue prematurely
- Let them struggle productively
- Support without doing
- Debrief thoroughly afterward

### The Debrief

**After failure:**
- What happened?
- What were the decision points?
- What would you do differently?
- What did you learn?
- How will you apply this?

**Not:**
- What were you thinking?
- This was wrong
- I would have done X
- Blame and shame

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Development Opportunity Scan

Look at your upcoming delegations:
1. What development opportunities exist?
2. Who could benefit from each?
3. What support would they need?
4. How will you debrief afterward?

### Exercise 2: The Stretch Assignment

Design one stretch assignment:
1. Who needs it?
2. What's the assignment?
3. What development does it create?
4. What support will you provide?
5. When will you debrief?

### Exercise 3: The Development Debrief

After a recent delegation:
1. Have a development conversation
2. Focus on learning, not just results
3. Ask about challenges and insights
4. Discuss application going forward
5. Notice the impact

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Do you see delegation as capacity management or development opportunity?

2. Are you matching delegations to development needs, or just to workload?

3. How much stretch do you provide? Is it enough for development?

4. What support do you provide for stretch assignments?

5. How do you handle failure? Is it a development moment or a blame moment?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "You cannot push anyone up the ladder unless he is willing to climb."

Delegation is the ladder. Your job isn't to push—it's to provide rungs. Create stretch assignments that develop capability. Provide support that enables success. Debrief to consolidate learning. This is how leaders are made.
