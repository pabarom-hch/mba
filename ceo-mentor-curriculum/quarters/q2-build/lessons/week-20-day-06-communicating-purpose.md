# Day 6: Communicating Purpose

**Week 20 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Napoleon Hill**

> "It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed."

## The Core Insight

A leader's purpose must be communicated and shared. A Definite Major Purpose locked in your mind has limited power—it organizes only your own efforts. Communicated purpose becomes a rallying point, attracting resources, aligning people, and multiplying impact.

If you can't explain it, you haven't defined it. If others don't understand it, they can't help achieve it.

## Why Communication Matters

### Purpose Alone Is Not Enough

**Internal purpose:**
- Organizes your effort
- Guides your decisions
- Motivates your action
- But limited to you

**Communicated purpose:**
- Attracts aligned people
- Generates support
- Creates momentum
- Multiplies through others

### The Leader's Requirement

**CEOs must:**
- Articulate purpose clearly
- Communicate it consistently
- Inspire others with it
- Align teams around it

**The test:**
- Can your team repeat your purpose?
- Do they understand why it matters?
- Do they know how they contribute?
- Are they enrolled, not just employed?

## The Purpose Pitch

### The One-Sentence Version

**The formula:**
"We [do what] for [whom] so that [result]."

**Examples:**
- "We build technology that transforms healthcare access so that everyone can receive quality care."
- "We create educational content for entrepreneurs so that they can build successful businesses."
- "We manufacture sustainable products for conscious consumers so that business can heal the planet."

### The One-Paragraph Version

**The structure:**
1. The purpose (one sentence)
2. Why it matters (one sentence)
3. How we'll achieve it (one sentence)
4. The outcome we're creating (one sentence)

**Example:**
"We build technology that transforms healthcare access so that everyone can receive quality care. Millions of people suffer because they can't access the care they need. We're solving this by creating digital tools that connect patients with providers regardless of location or resources. The world we're creating is one where geography and economics no longer determine health outcomes."

### The Story Version

**The structure:**
1. The problem (what's wrong)
2. The opportunity (what could be)
3. Our role (what we do)
4. The future (what we'll create)

**Use this when:**
- Inspiring teams
- Pitching investors
- Attracting talent
- Building culture

## Key Quote for the Day

> "It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed."

And to help others succeed, they must understand what success means. They must know the purpose so they can contribute to it. Communication enables contribution. Contribution enables achievement. Your purpose, clearly communicated, enables everyone to help you—and themselves—succeed.
