# Day 3: Authority, Not Just Tasks

**Week 16 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

> "Concentrate your energies, your thoughts and your capital."

## The Core Insight

There's a crucial difference between delegating a task and delegating authority. Task delegation says "Do this specific thing and report back." Authority delegation says "This is your domain; own it completely."

Task delegation keeps you as the bottleneck—every decision still flows through you. Authority delegation removes the bottleneck—decisions are made by those with the responsibility. One adds hands; the other multiplies leadership.

---

## The Levels of Delegation

### Level 1: Do Exactly As I Say

**What it looks like:**
- Specific instructions given
- No deviation allowed
- Check in at every step
- No judgment required

**What it produces:**
- Task completion
- No development
- Total dependence
- You remain bottleneck

### Level 2: Look Into It and Report Back

**What it looks like:**
- Research assigned
- Findings reported
- You analyze
- You decide

**What it produces:**
- Information gathering
- Some learning
- Still dependent on you for decisions
- Bottleneck remains

### Level 3: Give Me Options With Your Recommendation

**What it looks like:**
- Analysis assigned
- Options presented
- Recommendation made
- You decide

**What it produces:**
- Analytical development
- Beginning of judgment
- You still decide
- Bottleneck reduced but present

### Level 4: Decide and Tell Me What You Decided

**What it looks like:**
- Area owned
- Decisions made
- You're informed
- You can veto (but rarely should)

**What it produces:**
- Decision-making development
- Real ownership
- Significant bottleneck reduction
- Real authority beginning

### Level 5: Decide and Act; Tell Me Only If Problems

**What it looks like:**
- Complete ownership
- Full authority
- Minimal reporting
- Full trust

**What it produces:**
- Complete development
- Full ownership
- Bottleneck eliminated
- True multiplication

### Where Most CEOs Operate

**Typical pattern:**
- Levels 1-3 most of the time
- Level 4 for favored few
- Level 5 almost never
- Constant bottleneck

**Where they should be:**
- Level 5 for many things
- Level 4 for important decisions
- Levels 1-3 only for new situations
- Bottleneck eliminated

## Why Authority Matters

### Task Delegation Problems

**What happens when you only delegate tasks:**
- You're consulted on everything
- Calendar full of decisions
- Team waits for you
- Speed limited by your availability
- No leadership development
- Exhaustion and frustration

### Authority Delegation Benefits

**What happens when you delegate authority:**
- Decisions made without you
- Calendar freed for what matters
- Team moves at full speed
- Organization scales beyond you
- Leaders develop throughout
- Sustainable pace

### The Multiplication Effect

**Task delegation math:**
- 1 CEO + 10 task-executors = 1 decision-maker (you)
- Limited by your bandwidth
- Linear at best

**Authority delegation math:**
- 1 CEO + 10 authority-holders = 11 decision-makers
- Limited only by collective capacity
- Multiplicative

## What Authority Really Means

### The Components of Authority

**1. Decision Rights**
- Can decide without asking
- Knows the boundaries
- Understands the limits
- Has clear scope

**2. Resource Access**
- Budget to deploy
- People to direct
- Tools to use
- Ability to act

**3. Accountability**
- Owns the outcome
- Measured on results
- Responsible for decisions
- Answers for area

**4. Cover**
- Backed when challenged
- Supported when failing
- Defended externally
- Not thrown under bus

### Pseudo-Authority

**When authority isn't real:**
- Decisions require approval
- Resources need permission
- Accountability without power
- No cover when challenged

**This is worse than no authority—it's false authority that frustrates and disempowers.**

## How to Delegate Authority

### Step 1: Define the Domain

**Clarify what they own:**
- What's included
- What's excluded
- Where the boundaries are
- What success looks like

### Step 2: Specify Decision Rights

**Make it explicit:**
- What can they decide alone
- What requires consultation
- What requires approval
- What's reserved to you

### Step 3: Provide Resources

**Give what's needed:**
- Budget authority
- People authority
- Time and space
- Tools and access

### Step 4: Establish Accountability

**Define the measures:**
- What outcomes matter
- How they'll be measured
- When they'll be reviewed
- What success and failure look like

### Step 5: Commit to Support

**Back them up:**
- Defend their decisions
- Support through failures
- Provide air cover
- Don't undermine

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Carnegie's Managers

How Carnegie delegated authority:

**His approach:**
- Hired excellent managers
- Defined their domains clearly
- Gave real authority over operations
- Held accountable for results
- Rarely interfered with methods

**The result:**
- Operations ran without him
- Decisions made locally
- Speed of execution high
- Leaders developed constantly
- Empire scaled

**The lesson:** Real authority creates real scale.

### Case 2: The False Delegation

A CEO who delegated tasks, not authority:

**The pattern:**
- Gave responsibilities
- Required approval for decisions
- Second-guessed constantly
- Took back when stressed

**The result:**
- Team frustrated
- Decisions delayed
- No development
- CEO exhausted
- Organization stuck

**The lesson:** Pseudo-authority is worse than none.

### Case 3: The Authority Transformation

A CEO who learned to give real authority:

**The before:**
- All decisions through her
- Calendar packed
- Team waiting
- Growth stalled

**The change:**
- Defined domains clearly
- Gave decision rights explicitly
- Backed decisions
- Focused on what mattered

**The result:**
- Decisions made quickly
- Team empowered
- Leaders emerged
- Organization scaled

**The lesson:** Delegation style can change.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Authority Assessment

**For each direct report:**

| Person | Domain | Decision Rights | Resources | Accountability | Real Authority? |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| | Clear? | Explicit? | Adequate? | Clear? | Y/N |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

### Application 2: Level Audit

**What level are you delegating at?**

| Area/Person | Current Level | Should Be | What's Preventing |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| | 1-5 | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 3: Authority Grant

**Plan one authority upgrade:**

| Who | Current State | Authority to Grant | Boundaries | Resources | Accountability |
|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| | | | | | |

### Application 4: Cover Check

**Do you truly back your people?**

| Person | Recent Challenge | Did You Back Them? | What Would Full Cover Look Like? |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| | | Y/N | |
| | | | |

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Level Assessment

For each major area you've delegated:
1. What level are you really at?
2. What would moving up a level look like?
3. What's preventing it?
4. What's the cost of staying where you are?

### Exercise 2: The Authority Grant

Choose one area to upgrade:
1. Define the domain clearly
2. Specify decision rights explicitly
3. Ensure resources are available
4. Clarify accountability
5. Commit to backing them up

### Exercise 3: The Cover Test

Recall a recent challenge to someone's decision:
1. How did you respond?
2. Did you back them fully?
3. What message did you send?
4. What would full cover look like?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. When you delegate, are you delegating tasks or authority? What's the honest evidence?

2. What level of delegation do you typically operate at? What's preventing you from moving higher?

3. Do the people you've delegated to feel they have real authority? How would you know?

4. Have you ever taken back authority? What message did that send?

5. What would your organization look like if you delegated at Level 5 throughout?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Concentrate your energies, your thoughts and your capital."

You can only concentrate your energies on what matters if you've delegated authority—not just tasks—for everything else. Give real authority: clear domains, explicit decision rights, adequate resources, defined accountability, and genuine cover. This is how empires are built.
