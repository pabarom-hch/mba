# Day 6: Q2 Achievement Assessment

**Week 26 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Napoleon Hill**

> "The starting point of all achievement is desire. Weak desires bring weak results."

---

## The Core Insight

A quarter has passed. Thirteen weeks of study, practice, and application. Q2's theme was BUILD—translating thinking into tangible creation. Now is the time for honest assessment: What did you actually build? What progress was made? What worked, what didn't, and what will you do differently?

Assessment without honesty is useless. Be rigorous. Be truthful.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The starting point of all achievement is desire. Weak desires bring weak results."

If your Q2 results were weak, examine your desire. Was it truly burning? Or was it lukewarm? Weak desire produces weak results. Strong desire produces strong results. The desire level explains much of the result. If you want different results in Q3, intensify your desire.
