# Day 6: Building Persistence

**Week 24 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Napoleon Hill**

> "Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success."

---

## The Core Insight

Persistence is not a fixed trait—it's a capacity that can be developed. Like a muscle, it grows stronger with exercise and weakens with disuse. Hill identified specific practices that build persistence. Through deliberate effort, anyone can develop the persistence required for achievement.

Persistence is not a gift. It's a skill.

- Persistence was automatic
- Achievement followed

### Case 3: The Gradual Builder

An entrepreneur who built persistence gradually:

**Their approach:**
- Started where they were
- Chose manageable challenges
- Completed them
- Gradually increased difficulty

**The progression:**
- Month 1: Small daily disciplines

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success."

These three are all cultivated, not given. Patience is learned. Persistence is built. Perspiration is chosen. Together, they're unbeatable—but they require development. The good news: anyone can develop them. The question: will you?
