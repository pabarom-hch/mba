# Day 2: Trust Before Delegation

**Week 16 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

## The Core Insight

Delegation without trust is micromanagement in disguise. You delegate the task but not the authority. You give the responsibility but withhold the trust. This creates the worst of both worlds: the appearance of delegation with none of its benefits.

Trust must precede delegation. Without it, you'll take back control at the first difficulty, undermine decisions, and destroy the very development you're trying to create.

## Why Trust Is the Foundation

### The Trust-Delegation Connection

**With trust:**
- You delegate completely
- You don't second-guess
- You back decisions
- You allow failure as learning
- Real authority is given

**Without trust:**
- You delegate partially
- You check constantly
- You override decisions
- You punish mistakes
- No real authority exists

### The Delegation Paradox

**The problem:**
- To trust, you need to see track record
- To see track record, you need to delegate
- To delegate, you need to trust
- Circular dependency

**The resolution:**
- Start with small delegations
- Build trust incrementally
- Expand as trust grows
- Trust begets more trust

## Understanding Trust

### Components of Trust

**1. Competence Trust**
- Belief in their ability
- Confidence in their skills
- Faith in their judgment
- Track record of delivery

**2. Character Trust**
- Belief in their integrity
- Confidence in their values
- Faith in their honesty
- Track record of reliability

**3. Care Trust**
- Belief they have your interests at heart
- Confidence in their loyalty
- Faith in shared purpose
- Track record of alignment

### The Trust Equation

**Trust = (Competence + Character + Care) / Self-Interest**

- High competence alone isn't enough
- High character alone isn't enough
- Care without competence is insufficient
- Self-interest erodes all trust

## Diagnosing Your Trust

### Why You Don't Trust

**Is it them?**
- Have they demonstrated incompetence?
- Have they shown character flaws?
- Have they put self-interest first?
- Is there evidence for distrust?

**Or is it you?**
- Do you have control needs?
- Is your ego preventing trust?
- Are your standards impossible?
- Is trust difficult in general?

### The Honest Assessment

**For each person:**

| Person | Competence Trust | Character Trust | Care Trust | Overall | Root Issue |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|------------|---------|------------|
| | H/M/L | H/M/L | H/M/L | | Them/Me/Both |

### Common Patterns

**Over-trusters:**
- Trust too easily
- Don't verify
- Get burned
- Still don't verify

**Under-trusters:**
- Trust too little
- Verify everything
- Micromanage
- Never let go

**Selective trusters:**
- Trust some completely
- Trust others not at all
- Often based on personal preference
- Not always based on evidence

---

## Building Trust

### Strategy 1: Incremental Delegation

**Start small:**
- Low-risk tasks first
- Observe performance
- Expand as trust grows
- Build track record

**The progression:**
- Research and report
- Analyze and recommend
- Decide and inform
- Decide and act

### Strategy 2: Clear Expectations

**Set up for success:**
- Define outcomes clearly
- Explain the boundaries
- Specify decision rights
- Agree on check-in points

**When expectations are clear:**
- Trust is easier
- Performance is measurable
- Course correction is possible
- Both parties understand success

### Strategy 3: Verify Without Micromanaging

**Appropriate oversight:**
- Agree on check-in rhythm
- Focus on outcomes, not methods
- Ask questions, don't dictate
- Use systems, not surveillance

**The difference:**
- Micromanaging: Checking everything, directing methods
- Appropriate oversight: Agreed check-ins, outcome focus

### Strategy 4: Build Relationship

**Trust requires connection:**
- Know them as people
- Understand their motivations
- Build genuine relationship
- Create shared experience

**Beyond work:**
- Their aspirations
- Their challenges
- Their values
- Their life

## When Trust Is Broken

### Diagnosing the Break

**What happened:**
- Competence failure?
- Character breach?
- Care misalignment?
- Communication breakdown?

**How serious:**
- Mistake or pattern?
- Recoverable or disqualifying?
- Learning opportunity or fundamental issue?
- Worth rebuilding?

### Rebuilding Trust

**If worth rebuilding:**
- Name what happened
- Understand the cause
- Agree on changes
- Start with small trust again
- Rebuild incrementally

**If not worth rebuilding:**
- Be honest with yourself
- Make the necessary decision
- Don't pretend trust exists
- Either fix it or exit it

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Trust Built Deliberately

A CEO who built trust systematically:

**The approach:**
- Started new executives with defined projects
- Observed performance carefully
- Gave feedback openly
- Expanded trust as earned
- Communicated trust explicitly

**The result:**
- Strong, trusting relationships
- Effective delegation
- High performance
- Mutual loyalty

**The lesson:** Trust can be built deliberately.

### Case 2: Trust Given Prematurely

A CEO who trusted too fast:

**The mistake:**
- Hired impressive executive
- Gave full authority immediately
- Didn't verify claims
- Ignored early warning signs

**The result:**
- Major failures
- Significant damage
- Had to terminate
- Trust harder next time

**The lesson:** Trust must be earned, not assumed.

### Case 3: Trust Withheld Inappropriately

A CEO who couldn't trust:

**The pattern:**
- Hired excellent people
- Couldn't let go
- Checked everything
- Overrode decisions
- Frustrated team

**The result:**
- Top talent left
- Mediocrity remained
- Organization limited
- CEO overwhelmed

**The lesson:** Withholding trust is expensive.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Trust Inventory

**Assess your trust in each direct report:**

| Person | Competence | Character | Care | Overall | Delegation Level | Gap |
|--------|------------|-----------|------|---------|------------------|-----|
| | 1-10 | 1-10 | 1-10 | 1-10 | Current | |

### Application 2: Trust Building Plan

**For each trust gap:**

| Person | Trust Gap | Root Cause | Building Strategy | Timeline |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

### Application 3: Self-Assessment

**Rate yourself:**

| Question | Rating (1-10) |
|----------|---------------|
| I give trust appropriately | |
| I build trust deliberately | |
| I don't withhold trust due to control needs | |
| I rebuild trust after breaks | |
| I know when trust isn't possible | |

### Application 4: Trust Conversation

**Plan a trust conversation:**

- Who needs it?
- What needs to be said?
- What trust level do you want?
- What would demonstrate it?

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Trust Audit

For each direct report:
1. What's your trust level?
2. What's it based on?
3. Is it appropriate?
4. What would increase it?

### Exercise 2: The Trust Conversation

Have a conversation with someone:
1. Express your trust level honestly
2. Explain what you need to trust more
3. Ask what they need from you
4. Agree on building strategy

### Exercise 3: Trust Self-Examination

Ask yourself:
1. Is my trust calibrated to evidence?
2. Am I withholding trust due to control needs?
3. Am I trusting too easily?
4. What patterns do I see?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Do you trust your team? Truly? What's the evidence for your answer?

2. For those you don't fully trust, is the issue competence, character, or care? What would change it?

3. Is your level of trust calibrated to evidence, or driven by control needs?

4. What trust are you withholding that you should give?

5. What would it take for you to trust more fully?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "As I grow older, I pay less attention to what men say. I just watch what they do."

Trust is built through action, not words. Watch what people do. Build trust incrementally. Verify without micromanaging. And give trust when it's earned—fully, not partially. Without trust, delegation is impossible.

## Tomorrow's Preview

**Day 3** explores **Authority, Not Just Tasks**—the critical difference between delegating tasks and delegating real authority, and why the latter is essential for true multiplication.
