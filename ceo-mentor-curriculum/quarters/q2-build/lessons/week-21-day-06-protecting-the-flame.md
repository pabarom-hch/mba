## The Core Insight

Burning desire is vulnerable. Negativity, doubt, discouragement, and the wrong environment can extinguish even the most intense flame. Building burning desire is only half the challenge—protecting it is the other half. The flame must be guarded.

What threatens your flame? And how will you protect it?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way."

And if you cannot eliminate all threats to your desire, eliminate what you can. Control what's controllable. Protect what's protectable. Small things done greatly—daily protection practices, environment control, mental discipline—add up to a flame that cannot be extinguished.

## Tomorrow's Preview
