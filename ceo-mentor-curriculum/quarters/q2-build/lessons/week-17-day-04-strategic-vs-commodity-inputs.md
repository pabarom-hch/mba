# Day 4: Strategic vs. Commodity Inputs

**Week 17 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

> "Watch the costs and the profits will take care of themselves."

## The Core Insight

Not all inputs are equal. Some are strategic—they affect your differentiation, quality, or competitive position. Others are commodities—interchangeable, widely available, and undifferentiated. Carnegie integrated iron ore (strategic) but bought office supplies (commodity).

The distinction matters because integration makes sense for strategic inputs but often wastes resources on commodities. Know the difference.

## Strategic vs. Commodity

### Strategic Inputs

**Characteristics:**
- Affect your differentiation
- Impact quality significantly
- Limited alternatives
- Supplier has power
- Critical to competitive position

**Examples:**
- Key components that define quality
- Technology that enables differentiation
- Specialized expertise
- Critical raw materials

**Integration calculus:**
- High value from control
- Competitive advantage from ownership
- Worth the investment
- Focus is justified

### Commodity Inputs

**Characteristics:**
- Widely available
- Undifferentiated
- Many suppliers
- Price is main variable
- Doesn't affect your differentiation

**Examples:**
- Office supplies
- Standard utilities
- Common materials
- Generic services

**Integration calculus:**
- Little value from control
- No competitive advantage from ownership
- Investment not justified
- Distraction from core

## The Classification Framework

### Dimension 1: Impact on Differentiation

**Ask:**
- Does this input affect what makes us unique?
- Does it impact customer-perceived quality?
- Does it enable our competitive advantage?
- Would customers notice if it changed?

**High impact = Strategic**
**Low impact = Commodity**

### Dimension 2: Supplier Power

**Ask:**
- How many alternatives exist?
- How easy is switching?
- Does the supplier have leverage?
- Are we dependent on specific suppliers?

**High supplier power = Strategic**
**Low supplier power = Commodity**

### Dimension 3: Substitutability

**Ask:**
- Are there substitutes for this input?
- Is it interchangeable with alternatives?
- Does the source matter?
- Is it standardized?

**Low substitutability = Strategic**
**High substitutability = Commodity**

### The Matrix

|  | Low Differentiation Impact | High Differentiation Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **High Supplier Power** | Manage carefully | Integrate strongly |
| **Low Supplier Power** | Pure commodity | Integrate if economics work |

## Carnegie's Classification

### What He Treated as Strategic

**Iron ore:**
- Essential to steel quality
- Location-specific advantages
- Growing supplier power
- Critical to cost position

**Coal and coke:**
- Essential fuel
- Quality affected steel quality
- Transportation cost significant
- Supply security mattered

**Transportation:**
- Significant cost component
- Bottleneck potential
- Reliability essential
- Control created advantage

### What He Treated as Commodity

**Office operations:**
- Didn't affect steel
- Many alternatives
- No competitive advantage from ownership
- Not worth focus

**Non-core services:**
- Let others specialize
- Bought on market
- Didn't distract
- Stayed focused

### His Principle

**Strategic:**
- Invest heavily
- Integrate when possible
- Build competitive advantage
- Worth the focus

**Commodity:**
- Manage efficiently
- Buy on market
- Don't invest in ownership
- Don't distract

## Applying the Classification

### Step 1: List All Inputs

**Everything you use:**
- Materials
- Components
- Services
- Technology
- Expertise

### Step 2: Classify Each

**For each input:**

| Input | Differentiation Impact | Supplier Power | Substitutability | Classification |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| | H/M/L | H/M/L | H/M/L | Strategic/Commodity |

### Step 3: Align Strategy

**For strategic inputs:**
- Consider integration
- Build strong relationships
- Invest in control
- Prioritize attention

**For commodity inputs:**
- Manage efficiently
- Use market mechanisms
- Don't over-invest
- Minimize attention

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Strategic Distinction

A company that classified correctly:

**The analysis:**
- Key component was strategic (affected quality)
- Office supplies were commodity (didn't matter)
- Focused integration on strategic
- Managed commodity efficiently

**The result:**
- Captured value where it mattered
- Didn't waste resources
- Maintained focus
- Built competitive advantage

**The lesson:** Classification enables focus.

### Case 2: The Commodity Mistake

A company that integrated commodity:

**The situation:**
- Acquired supplier of standard component
- Thought it would save money
- Component was commodity—many alternatives

**What happened:**
- Distraction from core
- No competitive advantage
- Could have bought cheaper on market
- Wasted resources

**The lesson:** Integrating commodity wastes resources.

### Case 3: The Strategic Miss

A company that failed to integrate strategic:

**The situation:**
- Key component was strategic
- Left it with supplier
- Supplier gained power
- Eventually raised prices and limited supply

**What happened:**
- Lost competitive position
- Costs increased
- Quality suffered
- Competitor who integrated won

**The lesson:** Failing to integrate strategic is risky.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Input Classification

**Classify your key inputs:**

| Input | Differentiation Impact | Supplier Power | Substitutability | Strategic? |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| | 1-10 | 1-10 | 1-10 | Y/N |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

### Application 2: Strategy Alignment

**Check strategy-classification alignment:**

| Input | Classification | Current Approach | Aligned? | Change Needed |
|-------|---------------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| | Strategic/Commodity | Integrated/Market | Y/N | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

### Application 3: Investment Review

**Review where you're investing:**

| Investment | Related Input | Classification | Appropriate? |
|------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| | | Strategic/Commodity | Y/N |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 4: Focus Assessment

**Where is attention going?**

| Area | Strategic Value | Attention Level | Appropriate? |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| | H/M/L | H/M/L | Y/N |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## When Commodities Become Strategic

### Watch for Shifts

**Commodities can become strategic when:**
- Supply concentrates
- Quality differentiates
- Scarcity emerges
- Technology changes

**Strategic can become commodity when:**
- Standardization occurs
- Alternatives emerge
- Substitutes appear
- Technology commoditizes

### Monitor and Adapt

**Regular assessment:**
- Has the input classification changed?
- Are new strategic factors emerging?
- Are formerly strategic inputs commoditizing?
- Does strategy need adjustment?

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Full Classification

Classify all your significant inputs:
1. List everything material you use
2. Rate each on three dimensions
3. Classify as strategic or commodity
4. Check strategy alignment

### Exercise 2: The Misalignment Audit

Find misalignments:
1. Where are you treating commodity as strategic?
2. Where are you treating strategic as commodity?
3. What should change?
4. What's the priority?

### Exercise 3: The Evolution Watch

Monitor for change:
1. What inputs might become strategic?
2. What strategic inputs might commoditize?
3. How would you respond?
4. What should you watch?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Do you distinguish between strategic and commodity inputs? How explicitly?

2. Are you investing appropriately in strategic inputs? Underinvesting?

3. Are you over-investing in commodity inputs? Wasting resources?

4. How would your integration strategy change if you classified more rigorously?

5. What inputs are at risk of shifting classification?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Watch the costs and the profits will take care of themselves."

This applies to strategic inputs—where watching costs means controlling them through integration. For commodity inputs, watching costs means buying efficiently on the market, not investing in ownership. Know the difference, and treat each appropriately.
