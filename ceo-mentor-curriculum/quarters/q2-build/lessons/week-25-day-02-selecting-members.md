## The Core Insight

The power of a mastermind depends entirely on its members. Choose poorly, and you get polite conversation. Choose well, and you access collective genius. Member selection is the most important decision in forming a mastermind alliance. It determines everything that follows.

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Character Failure

## Key Quote for the Day

> "You may rely upon this as being a statement of fact—that those who have acquired great fortunes did so through the use of this principle."

Hill studied 500 successful people. All used the mastermind principle. But the principle only works with the right people. Selection determines success. Choose carefully, and the principle delivers extraordinary results. Choose poorly, and you waste time or worse.
