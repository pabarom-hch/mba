| 4 | The Deliberate Mastermind | Design, don't hope for, collective intelligence |
| 5 | External Masterminds | Extend beyond your team to advisors and peers |
| 6 | Maintaining the Mastermind | Ongoing investment keeps the mastermind alive |

## Key Principles Summary

### From Carnegie

1. **The third mind is real.** When minds align, something emerges that didn't exist before.

2. **Harmony is essential.** Without it, minds collide rather than combine.

3. **Ego is the enemy.** You must genuinely want people better than yourself.

4. **Masterminds require design.** Don't hope—deliberately create.

5. **External masterminds matter.** Extend beyond your organization.

6. **Maintenance is non-negotiable.** Investment keeps it alive.

### The Integration

**Purpose + Minds + Harmony + Maintenance = Mastermind**

- Without purpose: No direction
- Without right minds: No complementarity
- Without harmony: No combination
- Without maintenance: No longevity
