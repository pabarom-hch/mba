# Day 2: What to Look For

**Week 15 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

> "As I grow older, I pay less attention to what men say. I just watch what they do."

## The Core Insight

Credentials impress. Interviews polish. Resumes craft. But Carnegie learned to look beyond the surface—to watch what people actually do. Track record trumps credentials. Character outlasts capability. And the pattern of past behavior predicts future performance.

What to look for isn't what's presented; it's what's revealed through action.

## Beyond Credentials

### The Credential Trap

**What credentials tell you:**
- They checked the boxes
- They have the formal qualifications
- They're part of the approved pool
- They can navigate selection processes

**What credentials don't tell you:**
- How they perform under pressure
- Whether they build or destroy teams
- If they'll adapt when things change
- What they'll do when no one's watching

### The Interview Performance

**What interviews reveal:**
- Presentation skills
- Articulateness
- Confidence in controlled settings
- Ability to prepare for known scenarios

**What interviews hide:**
- Real behavior under stress
- Authentic character
- Actual working style
- How they treat people when it doesn't matter

### Carnegie's Wisdom

**"Watch what they do":**
- Past behavior predicts future behavior
- Action reveals character
- Performance beats promises
- Track record doesn't lie

## The Deep Reference Check

### Beyond the Standard

**Standard reference check:**
- "Would you hire them again?"
- "What were their strengths?"
- "Any concerns?"
- (Usually worthless)

**Deep reference check:**
- Specific situations explored
- Character under pressure probed
- Working style investigated
- Patterns identified

### How to Do It

**Preparation:**
- Identify what matters most for this role
- Prepare specific scenarios to explore
- Find references who worked closely
- Include people not provided by candidate

**Questions that reveal:**
- "Tell me about a time they faced a major setback..."
- "How did they handle conflict with their team..."
- "What happened when they disagreed with leadership..."
- "How did people below them experience working for them..."
- "What would they need to work on to be more effective..."

### Red Flags to Notice

**Concerning patterns:**
- References who are evasive
- Inconsistent stories across references
- No one enthusiastic
- Character concerns from any source
- Pattern of bridge-burning

## Assessing Character

### The Small Moments Test

**Character reveals in small moments:**
- How they treat servers, assistants, junior people
- What they do when running late
- How they respond to minor frustrations
- What they talk about when no one important is listening

### The Pressure Test

**Character reveals under pressure:**
- Do they blame or own?
- Do they protect others or themselves?
- Do they maintain integrity or cut corners?
- Do they stay consistent or shift with wind?

### The Private Behavior Test

**Character reveals in private:**
- What's said about others when they're not present
- What's done when there's no oversight
- How commitments are kept when no one's checking
- What happens when they could get away with something

### The Pattern Over Time

**Character is pattern, not incident:**
- Consistent behavior across situations
- Predictable response to challenges
- Reliable treatment of people
- Stable values regardless of context

**The investigation:**
- Deep reference checks conducted
- Former colleagues interviewed
- Specific situations explored
- Patterns identified

**What was revealed:**
- Consistent excellence
- Strong character under pressure
- People loved working for them

**The result:** Outstanding hire.

**The lesson:** Track record reveals truth.

### Case 3: The Character Catch

A candidate whose character concerns were caught:

**The warning signs:**
- Something felt off
- References were evasive
- Stories didn't quite match
- Small inconsistencies

**The investigation:**

## Key Quote for the Day

> "As I grow older, I pay less attention to what men say. I just watch what they do."

Look beyond credentials to track record. Look beyond interviews to references. Look beyond presentations to character. What people do predicts what they'll do. Watch carefully.
