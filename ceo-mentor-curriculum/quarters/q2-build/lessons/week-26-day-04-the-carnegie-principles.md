# Day 4: The Carnegie Principles

**Week 26 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Napoleon Hill**

> "Here lies a man who knew how to enlist in his service better men than himself." — Andrew Carnegie's epitaph

---

## The Core Insight

Before Hill, there was Carnegie. Hill learned the mastermind principle from Carnegie and studied 500 successful people at Carnegie's suggestion. But Carnegie's teachings extend beyond what Hill made famous. This day reviews the Carnegie principles from Weeks 14-19, integrating his legacy into your operating system.

Carnegie built empires through people. His principles remain essential.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Here lies a man who knew how to enlist in his service better men than himself."

Carnegie chose this for his epitaph—above all his achievements, this is what he wanted remembered. Not the steel empire. Not the wealth. Not the libraries he built. The ability to enlist better men than himself. That's the master skill. That's the Carnegie legacy. Build through others.
