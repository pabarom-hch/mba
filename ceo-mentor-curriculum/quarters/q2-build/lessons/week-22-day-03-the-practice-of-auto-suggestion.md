# Day 3: The Practice of Auto-Suggestion

**Week 22 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Napoleon Hill**

> "Any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought."

---

## The Core Insight

Auto-suggestion is Hill's term for the deliberate practice of feeding thoughts to your subconscious mind. It's not mystical—it's the systematic use of repetition and emotion to create belief. The practice is simple; the consistency required is hard. But the results are real.

You can tell yourself anything. What you tell yourself repeatedly becomes what you believe.

## What Auto-Suggestion Is

### The Definition

**Auto-suggestion is:**
- Self-directed communication with the subconscious
- Repeated affirmation of purpose and belief
- Deliberate programming of the mind
- The bridge between conscious intention and subconscious belief

**It is not:**
- Magical thinking
- Passive hoping
- Mindless repetition
- Substitute for action

### The Mechanism

**How it works:**
- Conscious mind creates the statement
- Repetition sends it to subconscious
- Emotion intensifies the imprinting
- Subconscious accepts it as truth over time
- Belief shapes behavior
- Behavior creates results

**The key elements:**
- Specific statement of purpose
- Spoken aloud (not just thought)
- With genuine emotion
- Repeated consistently
- Morning and evening minimum

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought."

Any idea. Any plan. Any purpose. The mechanism of repetition works for whatever you feed it. The question is what you're repeating. Are you repeating affirmations of faith, or letting doubts repeat themselves? The mind will accept whatever you repeat with emotion. Choose deliberately.
