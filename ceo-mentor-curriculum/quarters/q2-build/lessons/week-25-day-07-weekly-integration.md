## Key Quote for the Week

> "No two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third, invisible, intangible force which may be likened to a third mind."

This is Hill's core insight about the mastermind. It's not just collaboration—it's synergy. It's not just cooperation—it's creation. When minds unite in harmony around purpose, something new emerges that neither possessed alone. This is the mastermind effect. It's available to anyone who builds the alliance.

## The Mastermind Check

**Before moving on, verify:**

□ I understand the difference between team and mastermind
□ I know the criteria for selecting members
□ I understand why harmony is essential
□ I can design effective operating structure
□ I understand mutual benefit as sustaining force
□ I know how to maintain an alliance
□ I have a plan for my mastermind (form, strengthen, or continue)

If any box is unchecked, address it before proceeding.
