# Day 6: Maintaining the Mastermind

**Week 14 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Andrew Carnegie**

## The Core Insight

Masterminds don't maintain themselves. Like any valuable relationship or asset, they require ongoing investment. Left untended, harmony fades, alignment drifts, and the third mind disappears.

The CEO must invest in mastermind maintenance—regular alignment, relationship cultivation, conflict resolution, and purpose renewal. This investment isn't extra work; it's essential to keeping the mastermind functioning.
