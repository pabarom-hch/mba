## The Core Insight

Excellent people have options every day. Recruiters call. Competitors court. Opportunities appear. Retention isn't automatic—it's earned daily through providing what excellent people need.

The keys to retention are the same as attraction: mission, challenge, growth, people, and culture. But retention requires knowing each individual's specific needs and delivering on them consistently.
