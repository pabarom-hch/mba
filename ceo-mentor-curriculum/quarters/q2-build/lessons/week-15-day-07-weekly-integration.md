- Are you excited when candidates intimidate you?
- Do you celebrate when team members outperform you?

### The Cycle of Excellence

**1. Hire Better**

- Look for track record and character
- Use deep reference checks
- Make excellent hires

**2. Attract Excellence**

**4. Develop Excellence**

**5. Maintain Excellence**

### The Compounding Effect

### The Carnegie Test

**Ask yourself:**

- Is my excellence standard clear and maintained?
- Could I earn Carnegie's epitaph?
