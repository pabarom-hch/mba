# Day 1: Wishing vs. Wanting vs. Burning

**Week 21 | Q2 — BUILD | Mentor: Napoleon Hill**

> "Desire is the starting point of all achievement, not a hope, not a wish, but a keen pulsating desire which transcends everything."

---

## The Core Insight

Hill didn't just say desire matters—he distinguished between three levels of desire. A wish is passive hoping. A want is active interest. A burning desire is all-consuming obsession. The level of your desire determines whether you'll persist through obstacles or give up when things get hard.

Most people wish. Some people want. The achievers burn.

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Edison's Burning Desire

Edison's level of desire:

**The evidence:**
- Thousands of failed experiments
- No discouragement
- "I have not failed. I've found 10,000 ways that don't work"
- Continued until success

**The level:** Burning
- Nothing could stop him
- Obstacles were information
- No thought of giving up
- All-consuming pursuit

**The result:** Achieved everything he set out to achieve

### Case 2: The Wishing Entrepreneur

An entrepreneur who only wished:

**The situation:**
- "I'd like to build a successful company"
- Took some action
- Hit first major obstacle
- Concluded "it wasn't meant to be"

**The level:** Wishing
- Passive desire
- Minimal sacrifice
- Quick surrender
- Dreams unrealized

**The result:** Never achieved the desire

### Case 3: The Transition from Wanting to Burning

An entrepreneur who intensified:

**Before:**
- Wanted to succeed
- Worked hard
- But not all-consuming
- Other priorities competed

**The shift:**
- Faced a crisis that clarified
- Realized it was now or never
- Eliminated other options
- Became obsessed

**After:**

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Desire is the starting point of all achievement, not a hope, not a wish, but a keen pulsating desire which transcends everything."

Not a hope. Not a wish. A keen pulsating desire that transcends everything. That's the level required for achievement. Hill studied 500 successful people—they all had this quality. The question is: do you?
