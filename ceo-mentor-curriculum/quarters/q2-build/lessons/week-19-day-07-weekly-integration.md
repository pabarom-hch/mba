## The Complete Philosophy of Wealth

### The Foundation: Wealth as Means

**The starting point:**
- Wealth is not an end in itself
- It is a means to something greater
- "Enough" should be defined
- Purpose gives meaning

### The Responsibility: Capacity Creates Obligation

**The ethical claim:**
- Those who can build have unique capacity
- Capacity creates responsibility
- The wealthy are trustees
- Benefit must extend beyond self

### The Method: Ladders, Not Hammocks

**The implementation:**
- Help people help themselves
- Create opportunity, not dependency
- Build institutions that persist
- Invest in capability

### The Character: Wealth as Test

**The personal challenge:**
- Wealth reveals and shapes character
- Guard rails protect integrity
- Values must be maintained
- The inner work matters

### The Legacy: What Outlasts

**The long view:**
- Business achievements are temporary
- Institutions can endure
- People create lasting impact
- Ideas persist indefinitely

### The Timing: Giving While Living

**The urgency:**
- Living giving has unique value

## Key Quote for the Week

> "The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced."

This is Carnegie's most provocative claim. It challenges the default assumption that wealth accumulation is an end in itself. The question isn't whether you can accumulate—it's what you'll do with what you accumulate. Will you die disgraced, or will you fulfill your responsibility as a trustee?

## Farewell to Carnegie

Carnegie was our mentor for six weeks. He taught us:
- How to leverage others through masterminds
- How to build organizations through delegation
- How to create competitive advantage through integration and cost leadership
- How to think about wealth as responsibility

He showed that building and giving are not opposites—they're phases of the same responsibility.

## Next Week Preview

**Week 20: Definiteness of Purpose**

Napoleon Hill begins by teaching that everything starts with a definite chief aim. Without it, effort is scattered and achievement is unlikely. Next week, we learn to define what we're building toward.
