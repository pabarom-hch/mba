## The Core Insight

Not every purpose is worth pursuing. Some are inherited from others' expectations. Some are too small to matter. Some are impossible to achieve. Before committing fully, test your purpose against criteria that reveal whether it's truly worthy of your life's energy.

A purpose worth pursuing must pass rigorous tests. Apply them before you commit.

## The Five Tests

### Test 1: Is It Specific?

**The requirement:**
- Clear, concrete, measurable
- No ambiguity
- Someone else could verify achievement
- Definite, not vague

**Questions to ask:**
- Can I describe exactly what success looks like?
- Could someone else tell if I achieved it?
- Is there any ambiguity?
- Is it measurable?

**Red flags:**
- "Be successful"
- "Make a difference"
- "Do well"
- Any goal without measurement

### Test 2: Is It Yours?

**The requirement:**
- Genuinely your desire
- Not inherited from others
- Not imposed by expectations
- Authentically chosen

**Questions to ask:**
- Do I want this, or do I think I should want it?
- Where did this goal come from?
- Whose voice am I hearing when I think of it?
- Would I pursue this if no one knew?

**Red flags:**
- "My parents always wanted..."
- "Society expects..."
- "I should..."
- "Everyone says..."

### Test 3: Does It Excite You?

**The requirement:**
- Creates energy, not drain
- Pulls you forward
- Generates enthusiasm
- Survives bad days

**Questions to ask:**
- Does thinking about this give me energy?
- Do I look forward to pursuing it?
- Would I work on it even if I didn't have to?
- Does it survive my worst days?

**Red flags:**
- Feels like obligation
- Creates dread
- Requires constant motivation
- Loses appeal on reflection

### Test 4: Is It Possible?

**The requirement:**
- Achievable (even if difficult)
- Within realm of possibility
- Others have done similar
- Laws of physics permit it

**Questions to ask:**
- Has anything like this been achieved before?
- Do I have the capacity (or could I develop it)?
- Are the resources available (or obtainable)?
- Is this realistically possible for someone like me?

**Red flags:**
- Violates physical laws
- Requires capabilities you can't develop
- Depends on others' choices you can't influence
- Has never been done and can't be imagined

### Test 5: Is the Sacrifice Worth It?

**The requirement:**
- What you'd gain exceeds what you'd give
- The trade is worthwhile
- You'd make it again knowing the cost
- Regret is unlikely

**Questions to ask:**
- What would I have to give up?
- What would I gain?
- Is that a trade I'd make consciously?
- Would I regret the trade?

**Red flags:**
- Requires sacrificing what's sacred
- Gains seem smaller than costs
- Hesitancy about the trade
- Would regret the sacrifice

## The Composite Test

### Scoring Your Purpose

| Test | Passes? (Y/N) | Evidence/Notes |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Specific | | |
| Yours | | |
| Excites you | | |
| Possible | | |
| Worth the sacrifice | | |
| **Total** | /5 | |

**Interpretation:**

- **5/5:** Strong purpose—commit fully
- **4/5:** Good purpose—address the gap
- **3/5:** Questionable—investigate deeply
- **2/5 or less:** Likely not your true purpose—reconsider

---

## Deep Dive: Is It Yours?

### How We Inherit Others' Goals

**Sources of inherited goals:**
- Parents' expectations
- Cultural norms
- Social comparison
- Fear of judgment
- Need for approval

**How it happens:**
- Absorb expectations as children
- Internalize others' definitions of success
- Pursue without questioning
- Realize later it wasn't ours

### Testing for Authenticity

**The solitude test:**
- If you were alone on an island, would you still want this?
- Remove social pressure—does desire remain?
- Strip away approval—is it still compelling?

**The origin test:**
- Where did this goal come from?
- Trace it back to its source
- Was it adopted or discovered?
- Is it truly yours?

**The energy test:**
- Do you light up when you pursue it?
- Does it feel like expression or obligation?
- Is the energy flowing out or being forced?
- Does it match who you are?

---

## Deep Dive: Does It Excite You?

### The Importance of Excitement

**Why it matters:**
- Difficult pursuits require internal fuel
- External motivation doesn't last
- Excitement survives setbacks
- Purpose without passion fails

**What real excitement looks like:**
- You think about it without trying
- You'd pursue it without payment
- You lose track of time working on it
- It aligns with your sense of identity

### Testing for Genuine Excitement

**The 5AM test:**
- Would you get up early to work on this?
- Would you sacrifice sleep for it?
- Does it pull you out of bed?

**The Monday test:**
- Do you look forward to Monday?
- Does the week feel like opportunity?
- Or does it feel like burden?

**The decade test:**
- Would you still want to be doing this in 10 years?
- Does it have long-term appeal?
- Or is it a phase?

## Deep Dive: Is It Possible?

### The Distinction: Difficult vs. Impossible

**Difficult:**
- Has been done before
- Requires growth but is achievable
- Demands effort but is within reach
- Stretch but possible

**Impossible:**
- Violates physical reality
- Requires something you can't develop
- Depends on things you can't control
- Beyond human capability

### Testing Possibility

**The precedent test:**
- Has someone done something similar?
- If so, what did it take?
- Could you do what they did?
- If no one has, could it be done?

**The capability test:**
- Do you have (or could you develop) the required capabilities?
- What would development require?
- Is that development realistic?

**The dependency test:**
- Does success depend on others' choices you can't influence?
- Is it within your control?
- Or are you hoping for others' actions?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle."

But effort and struggle for the right purpose. Testing your purpose before committing saves you from struggling for the wrong goal. The tests ensure your effort goes toward something worthy—something specific, yours, exciting, possible, and worth the sacrifice.
