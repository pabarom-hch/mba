# Week 21: Burning Desire

**Quarter:** Q2 — BUILD
**Mentor:** Napoleon Hill
**Theme:** The fuel of all accomplishment

> "The starting point of all achievement is desire. Weak desires bring weak results, just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat." — Napoleon Hill

---

## Overview

Hill distinguished between wishing and burning desire. A wish is passive; a burning desire is all-consuming. The difference determines achievement.

This week examines the quality of your desire—and how to intensify it when it's not yet burning.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Wishing vs. Wanting vs. Burning
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Desire is the starting point of all achievement, not a hope, not a wish, but a keen pulsating desire which transcends everything."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Rate your desire for your Definite Major Purpose: wish (passive), want (active), or burning (obsessive)? Be honest.

**CEO Application:**
If your desire isn't burning, why not? What would have to change for it to consume you?

---

### Day 2 — The Cost of Lukewarm Desire
**Morning Meditation:**
> "If you don't see yourself as a winner, then you cannot perform as a winner."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What opportunities have you missed because desire wasn't strong enough to overcome obstacles? What does lukewarm desire cost?

**CEO Application:**
Think of someone you know with truly burning desire. What's different about how they operate compared to you?

---

### Day 3 — Intensifying Desire
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Desire can be cultivated. What intensifies your desire? Vivid visualization? High stakes? Emotional connection? Proximity to success?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one technique for intensifying desire. Practice it today with your Definite Major Purpose.

---

### Day 4 — Burning Bridges
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Don't wait. The time will never be just right."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Some burn bridges behind them to intensify commitment. Others keep options open. What's your pattern? Does it serve you?

**CEO Application:**
Is there a commitment you're hedging that, if you fully committed, would intensify your burning desire?

---

### Day 5 — The Role of Dissatisfaction
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Desire often comes from dissatisfaction with the status quo. What are you dissatisfied enough about to fuel burning desire for change?

**CEO Application:**
Connect your Definite Major Purpose to what you're running from, not just what you're running toward. Does this intensify desire?

---

### Day 6 — Protecting the Flame
**Morning Meditation:**
> "If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Burning desire can be extinguished by negativity, doubt, and discouraging people. What threatens your flame? How do you protect it?

**CEO Application:**
Who or what dampens your desire? What can you do about it?

---

1. How burning is your desire now versus the start of the week?

- You persist when others would give up
- Your energy increases when working toward the purpose

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"A quitter never wins and a winner never quits."* — Napoleon Hill

The CEO with burning desire is unstoppable. Obstacles become problems to solve. Setbacks become learning opportunities. Doubters become motivation.

But many CEOs operate with lukewarm desire—enough to show up, not enough to break through. They accept "good enough" because true excellence would require too much.

Check your desire. If it's not burning, either intensify it or find a purpose that ignites you. Life is too short for tepid pursuits.
