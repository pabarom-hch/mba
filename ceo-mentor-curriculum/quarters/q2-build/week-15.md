**Quarter:** Q2 — BUILD
**Mentor:** Andrew Carnegie
**Theme:** Hiring, attracting, and cultivating talent better than yourself

## Overview

Carnegie's steel empire was built by Charles Schwab, Henry Frick, and dozens of other exceptional managers. Carnegie's genius was recognizing, attracting, and retaining them.

This week examines how to surround yourself with people who are better than you in their domains—and why your ego must allow it.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — The Humility to Hire Better
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Here lies a man who knew how to enlist in his service better men than himself."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Do you genuinely seek people better than yourself? Or do you unconsciously hire people who won't threaten your ego?

**CEO Application:**
Think about your last three hires. Did you seek people who would challenge you and raise the bar? Or people who would fit comfortably?

---

### Day 2 — What to Look For
**Morning Meditation:**
> "As I grow older, I pay less attention to what men say. I just watch what they do."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What qualities matter most in the people you surround yourself with? How do you assess for those qualities versus surface impressions?

**CEO Application:**
Write down your hiring criteria for senior roles. Are they focused on credentials, or on demonstrated capability and character?

---

### Day 3 — Attracting Excellence
**Morning Meditation:**
> "People who are unable to motivate themselves must be content with mediocrity, no matter how impressive their other talents."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What makes excellent people want to work with you? Is it compensation alone, or something more? What's your unique draw?

**CEO Application:**
Interview (informally) your best team member about why they joined and why they stay. What does it reveal about your value proposition?

---

### Day 4 — Retaining Excellence
**Morning Meditation:**
> "You cannot push anyone up the ladder unless he is willing to climb."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Excellent people have options. What keeps them? Challenge? Growth? Purpose? Compensation? Do you know what your best people need?

**CEO Application:**
Identify your top 3 critical performers. Do you know what keeps them engaged? If not, find out this week.

### Day 5 — Developing Excellence
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The average person puts only 25% of his energy and ability into his work. The world takes off its hat to those who put in more than 50% of their capacity."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Are you developing your people, or just using them? What investment are you making in their growth?

**CEO Application:**
For each direct report, answer: What have I done in the last month to develop them? Is it enough?

---

### Day 6 — The Excellence Standard
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Do your duty and a little more and the future will take care of itself."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What's your standard for excellence? Is it clear? Is it consistent? Does your organization know what "excellent" looks like?

**CEO Application:**
Articulate your standard of excellence in one paragraph. Is this standard known and lived throughout your organization?

---

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

1. Where is your team excellent? Where is it merely adequate?
2. What's preventing you from hiring better than yourself in key areas?
3. What's your value proposition to excellent people?

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"Take away my people, but leave my factories, and soon grass will grow on the factory floors. Take away my factories, but leave my people, and soon we will have a new and better factory."* — Andrew Carnegie

The business is the people. Factories depreciate; technology becomes obsolete; markets shift. But a team of excellent people will adapt, rebuild, and triumph.

Your most important work as CEO is assembling that team.
