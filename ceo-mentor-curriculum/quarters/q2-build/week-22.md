# Week 22: Faith and Auto-Suggestion

**Quarter:** Q2 — BUILD
**Mentor:** Napoleon Hill
**Theme:** Programming the subconscious mind for achievement

> "Faith is the starting point of all accumulation of riches." — Napoleon Hill

---

## Overview

Hill taught that the subconscious mind can be programmed through repeated suggestion. "Auto-suggestion" is the practice of deliberately feeding thoughts, affirmations, and visualizations to your subconscious until they become belief.

Faith, in Hill's framework, is not passive hope but active, cultivated belief—the conviction that your purpose will be achieved.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Faith as Active Belief
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Faith is the state of mind which may be induced, or created, by affirmation or repeated instructions to the subconscious mind."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Do you believe your Definite Major Purpose is achievable? Truly? Or are there doubts lurking beneath the surface?

**CEO Application:**
Write down your doubts about achieving your purpose. Now examine each: Is it evidence-based or fear-based?

---

### Day 2 — The Subconscious Mind
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The subconscious mind will not remain idle. If you fail to plant desires in your subconscious mind, it will feed upon the thoughts which reach it as the result of neglect."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What is your subconscious currently feeding on? What thoughts dominate your mental environment? Are they aligned with your purpose?

**CEO Application:**
Audit your mental inputs today. News? Social media? Conversations? Are they building faith or eroding it?

---

### Day 3 — The Practice of Auto-Suggestion
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Hill prescribed reading your purpose statement aloud twice daily with emotion. Have you tried this? What's your practice for reinforcing belief?

**CEO Application:**
Create an auto-suggestion practice: Write your purpose, read it aloud with emotion morning and evening. Try it today.

---

### Day 4 — Visualization
**Morning Meditation:**
> "If you do not see riches in your imagination, you will never see them in your bank balance."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Can you vividly see yourself having achieved your purpose? In detail? With emotion? What does it look like, feel like, sound like?

**CEO Application:**
Spend 5 minutes in detailed visualization of having achieved your purpose. Engage all senses. Feel the emotions.

---

### Day 5 — Overcoming Doubt
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Faith and fear make poor bedfellows. Where one is found, the other cannot exist."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What doubts recur when you think about your purpose? Where do they come from? How can you address them?

**CEO Application:**
For each recurring doubt, write a counter-statement of faith. Use these in your auto-suggestion practice.

---

### Day 6 — Environment and Faith
**Morning Meditation:**
> "You are the master of your destiny. You can influence, direct and control your own environment."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Your environment shapes your subconscious. What in your environment supports faith? What undermines it?

**CEO Application:**
Make one change to your environment that supports faith in your purpose. Remove something negative or add something positive.

---

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

**Review Questions:**
1. How strong is your faith in achieving your purpose?
2. What auto-suggestion practice did you establish?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Faith is cultivated, not just felt.** It can be developed through practice.

2. **The subconscious accepts repeated thoughts.** Program it deliberately or it programs itself.

3. **Auto-suggestion is the mechanism.** Repetition with emotion plants belief.

4. **Visualization reinforces faith.** See the achievement in detail.

5. **Environment shapes subconscious.** Curate inputs that support faith.

2. **Determine what you'll give in return** — Balance the equation
3. **Establish a definite date** — Create urgency
4. **Create a definite plan** — Know the path
5. **Write a clear statement** — Commit to paper
6. **Read aloud twice daily** — Morning and evening
7. **See and feel yourself achieving** — Engage emotion

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"Your subconscious mind recognizes and acts only upon thoughts which have been well-mixed with emotion or feeling."* — Napoleon Hill

Many CEOs intellectually know what they want but haven't truly programmed their subconscious to believe it and work toward it. They think about goals; they don't feel them.

The practices Hill describes may seem soft or strange. But the underlying principle is solid: what you repeatedly think and feel shapes your belief, which shapes your action, which shapes your results.

Take the auto-suggestion practice seriously. Try it for 30 days. Let results speak.
