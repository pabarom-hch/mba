# Week 16: Delegation and Trust

**Quarter:** Q2 — BUILD
**Mentor:** Andrew Carnegie
**Theme:** Building through others by giving real authority

> "No man will make a great leader who wants to do it all himself, or to get all the credit for doing it." — Andrew Carnegie

---

## Overview

Carnegie ran an empire from a distance. He trusted his managers with real authority, held them accountable for results, and didn't micromanage their methods. This enabled scale that hands-on management never could.

Delegation isn't about offloading work—it's about multiplying impact through others. But it requires trust, clear expectations, and the discipline to let go.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Delegation as Multiplication
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The secret of success is not in doing your own work, but in recognizing the right man to do it."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What are you doing that someone else could do? What are you not doing because you're consumed by delegable work?

**CEO Application:**
List everything on your plate this week. Mark each item: Must be me / Should delegate / Should eliminate. Act accordingly.

---

### Day 2 — Trust Before Delegation
**Morning Meditation:**
> "As I grow older, I pay less attention to what men say. I just watch what they do."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Do you trust your team? Truly? If not, why not? Is it their competence, their character, or your control needs?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one person you trust completely. What makes them trustworthy? Can you build that trust with others?

---

### Day 3 — Authority, Not Just Tasks
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Concentrate your energies, your thoughts and your capital."

**Reflection Prompt:**
When you delegate, do you delegate authority or just tasks? Is there a difference? What would delegating authority look like?

**CEO Application:**
Take one area where you've delegated tasks but retained authority. Give real authority. Define the boundaries, then step back.

---

### Day 4 — The Accountability Balance
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Do your duty and a little more and the future will take care of itself."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How do you hold people accountable without micromanaging? What's the right balance of freedom and accountability?

**CEO Application:**
Review how you track delegated work. Are you focused on outcomes or methods? Could you reduce check-ins while maintaining accountability?

---

### Day 5 — Letting Go of Credit
**Morning Meditation:**
> "No man will make a great leader who wants to do it all himself, or to get all the credit for doing it."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How do you feel when your team gets credit for something you contributed to? Can you genuinely celebrate their success?

**CEO Application:**
Find an opportunity this week to publicly give credit to someone on your team for something you could have claimed.

---

### Day 6 — Delegation and Development
**Morning Meditation:**
> "You cannot push anyone up the ladder unless he is willing to climb."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Is your delegation developing people, or just distributing work? What's the difference?

**CEO Application:**
Delegate something slightly beyond someone's current capability—a stretch assignment. Provide support but let them own it.

1. What did you successfully delegate this week?
2. Where are you holding on when you should let go?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Delegation is multiplication.** You can only do so much; through others, you can do far more.

2. **Delegate authority, not just tasks.** Tasks without authority isn't real delegation.

3. **Trust is prerequisite.** Build trust first, or delegation fails.

4. **Accountability and autonomy coexist.** Clear outcomes, freedom in methods.

5. **Delegation develops people.** It's not just about your capacity but their growth.

## Levels of Delegation

1. **Do exactly as I say** — Not real delegation
2. **Look into it and report back** — Research delegation
3. **Give me options with your recommendation** — Analysis delegation
4. **Decide and tell me what you decided** — Decision delegation
5. **Decide and act; tell me only if problems** — Full delegation

Most CEOs operate at levels 1-3 when they should be at levels 4-5.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"I never give detailed instructions. I tell them what I want and let them find their own way."* — Andrew Carnegie

Carnegie built an empire by hiring excellent people and trusting them with real authority. He focused on strategy, capital allocation, and relationships. His managers ran operations.

The CEO who can't let go builds a small company. The CEO who delegates with trust builds something that transcends any individual.
