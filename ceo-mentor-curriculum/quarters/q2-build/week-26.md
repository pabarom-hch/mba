**Morning Meditation:**

Hill taught that negative emotions (anger, frustration, fear) could be transmuted into fuel for achievement. How do you handle negative energy?

## Key Takeaways from Q2

1. **Build through others.** The mastermind and team excellence exceed individual capacity.

2. **Definiteness of purpose organizes everything.** Know exactly what you want.

3. **Desire must be burning.** Lukewarm desire produces lukewarm results.

4. **Plans convert desire to action.** Write them down. Execute them.

5. **Decision and persistence are the master keys.** Decide quickly, persist relentlessly.

6. **Wealth carries responsibility.** What is yours for?

## Transition to Q3: BE

Q1 taught you to think. Q2 taught you to build. Q3 teaches you to be.

With Jim Rohn and Gandhi, you'll turn inward—examining personal philosophy, self-discipline, daily habits, and character. The leader's inner life shapes the outer organization.

The organization reflects its leader. Q3 ensures you're worthy of what you're building.

## Mentor's Final Words

**Carnegie:**
*"My heart is in the work. No man will make a great business who wants to do it all himself or get all the credit."*

**Hill:**
*"Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve. The starting point of all achievement is a definite chief aim."*

You've spent 26 weeks building your thinking capacity and your building capacity. The second half of this curriculum focuses on being—who you are shapes everything else.
