# Week 19: The Gospel of Wealth

**Quarter:** Q2 — BUILD
**Mentor:** Andrew Carnegie
**Theme:** The purpose and responsibility of accumulation

> "The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced." — Andrew Carnegie

---

## Overview

Carnegie didn't just build wealth—he developed a philosophy about what wealth was for. His 1889 essay "The Gospel of Wealth" argued that the wealthy are trustees of their fortune, with a duty to distribute it for the public good during their lifetime.

This week examines wealth as responsibility, not just reward—and asks what your wealth is ultimately for.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Wealth as Means, Not End
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Surplus wealth is a sacred trust which its possessor is bound to administer in his lifetime for the good of the community."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What is your wealth for? Is it an end in itself or a means to something greater? What would you do if you had "enough"?

**CEO Application:**
Define "enough" for yourself. At what point does accumulation shift from necessary to purposeless?

---

### Day 2 — The Responsibility of Capacity
**Morning Meditation:**
> "No man becomes rich unless he enriches others."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Those who can build wealth have a capacity that most don't. What responsibility comes with that capacity?

**CEO Application:**
Beyond shareholders and employees, who benefits from your company's existence? Is that benefit intentional or accidental?

---

### Day 3 — Building vs. Giving
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The best means of benefiting the community is to place within its reach the ladders upon which the aspiring can rise."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Carnegie believed in helping people help themselves—libraries, universities, institutions—not handouts. Do you agree? What approach to impact resonates with you?

**CEO Application:**
If you were to direct significant resources to public benefit, what form would it take? What would create lasting impact?

---

### Day 4 — Wealth and Character
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The problem of our age is the proper administration of wealth."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How has wealth (or the pursuit of it) affected your character? For better? For worse? What guard rails do you have?

**CEO Application:**
What values guide your accumulation and use of wealth? Are they explicit? Do your actions align with them?

---

### Day 5 — Legacy Beyond Accumulation
**Morning Meditation:**
> "My heart is in the work."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Carnegie's legacy isn't the steel empire—it's the 2,500 libraries, Carnegie Mellon University, the Carnegie Foundation. What will your legacy be?

**CEO Application:**
If you were remembered for one thing beyond your business success, what would you want it to be?

---

### Day 6 — Giving While Living
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Carnegie argued for giving while living, not just through estates. Why does that matter? What's different about giving while you're alive?

**CEO Application:**
What could you give now that would have more impact than giving later? Time? Money? Expertise? Access?

---

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

**Review Questions:**
1. What is your wealth ultimately for?
2. How does the pursuit of wealth affect your character?
3. What legacy do you want beyond business success?
4. What could you give now rather than later?

**Weekly Synthesis:**
Write 2-3 sentences articulating your philosophy of wealth and its purpose.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"The man who acquires the ability to take full possession of his own mind may take possession of anything else to which he is justly entitled."* — Andrew Carnegie

Carnegie's life had two acts: building wealth and distributing it. He considered the second more important than the first. The steel empire was a means to the end of public benefit.

You don't have to wait until retirement to consider these questions. The philosophy of wealth affects how you build, not just how you give. And building with purpose creates a different outcome than building without it.

**Transition to Napoleon Hill:**
The next seven weeks shift to Napoleon Hill's codified principles of achievement. Where Carnegie showed what's possible through example, Hill extracted the principles through systematic study of 500 successful people.
