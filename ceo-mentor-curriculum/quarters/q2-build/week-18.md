# Week 18: Cost Leadership

**Quarter:** Q2 — BUILD
**Mentor:** Andrew Carnegie
**Theme:** The discipline of efficiency

> "Watch the costs and the profits will take care of themselves." — Andrew Carnegie

## Overview

Carnegie was obsessed with costs. He knew the cost of producing a ton of steel to the penny. His relentless cost reduction enabled lower prices, which drove volume, which enabled more scale advantages, which reduced costs further—a virtuous cycle that crushed competitors.

Cost leadership isn't about being cheap—it's about creating structural advantages through operational excellence.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"Cut the prices; scoop the market; run the mills full."* — Andrew Carnegie

Carnegie understood that in commodity markets, the low-cost producer wins. He invested in technology, drove efficiency, and used cost leadership to grow market share.

Not every business competes on cost. But every business should understand its cost structure deeply. Even if you compete on differentiation, cost discipline provides the resources to invest in your advantage.
