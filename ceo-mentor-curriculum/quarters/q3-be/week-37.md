## Overview

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"A leader is like a shepherd. He stays behind the flock, letting the most nimble go out ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind."* — Nelson Mandela (on Gandhi's approach)

The CEO who sees leadership as service attracts different people, builds different culture, and leaves different legacy than the CEO who sees leadership as power.

This doesn't mean being soft or permissive. Gandhi was fiercely determined. But his determination was in service of others, not himself.

Ask: Does my organization exist to serve me, or do I exist to serve my organization?
