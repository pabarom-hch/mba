# Week 27: Personal Philosophy

**Quarter:** Q3 — BE
**Mentor:** Jim Rohn
**Theme:** The foundation of all results

> "Your philosophy determines your actions, your actions determine your results, and your results determine your lifestyle." — Jim Rohn

---

## Overview

Rohn taught that everything begins with philosophy—how you think about life, work, success, failure, and yourself. Your philosophy is the lens through which you see the world, and it determines what actions you take.

Change your philosophy, change your life. This week examines and evolves your operating philosophy.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change."* — Jim Rohn

Most CEOs inherit their philosophy accidentally—from upbringing, culture, and unexamined experience. They operate on autopilot, wondering why results don't match intentions.

The examined philosophy becomes a powerful tool. You can consciously choose beliefs that serve your goals. You can discard beliefs that limit you. You can upgrade continuously through reading, mentors, and reflection.

Start with examination. What do you actually believe? Where did it come from? Does it serve you?
