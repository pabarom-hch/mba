# Week 35: Non-Violence (Ahimsa)

**Quarter:** Q3 — BE
**Mentor:** Mahatma Gandhi
**Theme:** Strength without destruction

> "Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction." — Gandhi

---

## Overview

Ahimsa—non-violence—extends far beyond physical violence. Gandhi applied it to thought, speech, and action. It includes not harming others through harsh words, manipulation, or competitive destruction.

For CEOs, ahimsa asks: How do you handle conflict, competition, and underperformance without causing unnecessary harm?

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Beyond Physical Violence
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Non-violence is the first article of my faith. It is also the last article of my creed."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Violence exists in words, manipulation, and competitive destruction. Where might you cause harm without physical violence?

**CEO Application:**
Notice today: Where do you cause harm through tone, criticism, or pressure? This isn't about being soft—it's about awareness.

---

### Day 2 — Strength, Not Weakness
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Non-violence and cowardice are contradictory terms. Non-violence is the greatest virtue, cowardice the greatest vice."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Ahimsa is not passive or weak. Gandhi's non-violent resistance required immense courage. How can you be forceful without being harmful?

**CEO Application:**
Think of a situation requiring firmness. How can you be strong without being destructive?

---

### Day 3 — Competition and Ahimsa
**Morning Meditation:**
> "I want to win not through violence but through truth and love."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How do you approach competition? To win by building yourself up, or by tearing competitors down? What's the difference?

**CEO Application:**
Review your competitive strategy. Does it create value, or primarily destroy rivals? What would non-violent competition look like?

---

### Day 4 — Handling Underperformance
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Hate the sin, love the sinner."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How do you handle underperformers? With dignity and development, or with shame and disposal? What's the most effective and humane approach?

**CEO Application:**
Think about a recent difficult conversation about performance. Was it handled with ahimsa? What could improve?

---

### Day 5 — Conflict Resolution
**Morning Meditation:**
> "An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind."

**Reflection Prompt:**
When wronged—by partners, employees, competitors—how do you respond? Retaliation? Reconciliation? What serves long-term interests?

**CEO Application:**
Identify a current conflict. What would a non-violent resolution look like? Not avoiding the conflict—resolving it without unnecessary harm.

---

### Day 6 — Inner Violence
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Non-violence is not a garment to be put on and off at will. Its seat is in the heart."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Ahimsa begins within. Do you treat yourself with violence—harsh self-criticism, unrealistic expectations, no rest?

**CEO Application:**
Notice your inner dialogue today. Is it constructive or violent? What would self-compassion without self-indulgence look like?

---

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will."* — Gandhi

The CEO who masters ahimsa discovers that non-violent approaches often work better. People respond to respect. Teams perform under challenge, not abuse. Competitors can be outbuilt, not just outlasted.

This doesn't mean being soft on performance or conflict-avoidant. It means being firm and clear without being destructive. The distinction matters.
