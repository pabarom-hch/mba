# Week 31: The Law of Averages — You Become Your Associations

**Quarter:** Q3 — BE
**Mentor:** Jim Rohn
**Theme:** The power of who you spend time with

> "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with." — Jim Rohn

---

## Overview

Rohn's most quoted teaching: your associations shape you more than willpower. If you spend time with people who settle, you'll settle. If you spend time with people who grow, you'll grow. Upgrading your results often requires upgrading your associations.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — The Five People
**Morning Meditation:**
> "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Who are the five people you spend the most time with? What do they value? How do they think? What do they aspire to?

**CEO Application:**
List your five closest associations. For each, note: What do they contribute to who you're becoming?

### Day 2 — Expanded vs. Limited
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Don't join an easy crowd; you won't grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Do your associations expand you or limit you? Do they raise the bar or lower it? Are you comfortable or challenged?

**CEO Application:**
Categorize your regular associations: Expanders (pull you up), Maintainers (neutral), or Limiters (pull you down).

### Day 3 — The Disassociation Challenge
**Morning Meditation:**
> "You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Are there associations you need to reduce or eliminate? What makes that difficult? What's the cost of not doing it?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one association that consistently drains you or limits your growth. What would reducing that association require?

### Day 4 — Seeking Expanders
**Morning Meditation:**
> "It's better to hang out with people better than you. Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you'll drift in that direction."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Who do you know (or could know) who would expand you? What's preventing more time with them?

**CEO Application:**
List three people who are where you want to be. How could you increase association with them?

### Day 5 — Your Contribution
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Let others lead small lives, but not you. Let others argue over small things, but not you. Let others cry over small hurts, but not you."

**Reflection Prompt:**
You're in someone else's five people too. What do you contribute to them? Are you an expander or limiter for others?

**CEO Application:**
For your key relationships, ask: Am I contributing to their growth? How could I add more value?

### Day 6 — Deliberate Association Design
**Morning Meditation:**
> "If you want to have more, you have to become more."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Most people's associations are accidental—proximity and history. What would deliberate association design look like?

**CEO Application:**
Design your ideal association portfolio. Who would be in your five? How would you cultivate those relationships?

## Rohn's Association Categories

**Disassociation:** Some relationships must be ended or minimized.

**Limited Association:** Some relationships should have boundaries—limited time and influence.

**Expanded Association:** Some relationships should be deepened and prioritized.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"Go where the expectations are high. Go where the demands to perform are high."* — Jim Rohn

The CEO who spends time only with people who affirm them gets stale. The CEO who seeks out people who challenge them keeps growing.

Your peer group matters more than you realize. Seek out CEOs who are ahead of you. Join masterminds with people who make you uncomfortable. The discomfort is the growth.
