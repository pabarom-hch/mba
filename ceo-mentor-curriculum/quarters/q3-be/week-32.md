# Week 32: Goal Setting and Achievement

**Quarter:** Q3 — BE
**Mentor:** Jim Rohn
**Theme:** Dreams with deadlines

> "If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much." — Jim Rohn

---

## Overview

Rohn taught practical goal-setting as an essential discipline. Goals give direction, motivation, and measurement. Without them, you drift into others' agendas. This week establishes a comprehensive goal-setting practice.

---

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Why Goals Matter
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The ultimate reason for setting goals is to entice you to become the person it takes to achieve them."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What's the purpose of goals for you? Achievement? Direction? Motivation? Measurement? Growth?

**CEO Application:**
Review your current goals. Are they written? Specific? Dated? If not, they're wishes, not goals.

---

### Day 2 — Goal Categories
**Morning Meditation:**
> "We all need lots of powerful long-range goals to help us past the short-term obstacles."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Rohn set goals across categories: economic, material, personal development, family/social. Do your goals span multiple dimensions of life?

**CEO Application:**
Ensure you have goals in at least four life categories. An imbalanced life eventually undermines even business success.

---

### Day 3 — Short, Medium, and Long
**Morning Meditation:**
> "A goal is a dream with a deadline."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Do you have goals at multiple time horizons? 90-day, 1-year, 5-year, lifetime? How do they connect?

**CEO Application:**
For your most important goal, cascade it: What's the lifetime vision? 5-year milestone? 1-year target? 90-day objective?

---

### Day 4 — The Pull of Goals
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it."

**Reflection Prompt:**
The best goals pull you—they're exciting enough that you run toward them. Do your goals pull you, or do you push toward them?

**CEO Application:**
Rate each goal on pull (1-10). Goals below 7 may need to be reframed or replaced.

---

### Day 5 — Review and Adjustment
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Review your goals twice every day in order to be focused on achieving them."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How often do you review your goals? Daily? Weekly? Or are they forgotten after being set?

**CEO Application:**
Establish a goal review rhythm: daily glance, weekly review, monthly assessment, quarterly revision.

---

### Day 6 — Achievement and Celebration
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Learn how to be happy with what you have while you pursue what you want."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Do you celebrate achieved goals, or immediately move to the next? What does achievement feel like?

**CEO Application:**
Look at recent accomplishments. Did you celebrate? If not, how does that affect your motivation?

---

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

**Review Questions:**
1. How complete is your goal system?
2. Are your goals pulling you forward?
3. What's your review and adjustment rhythm?
4. How do you celebrate achievement?

**Weekly Synthesis:**
Write 2-3 sentences on your philosophy of goal-setting.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Goals give direction.** Without them, you drift.

2. **Categories ensure balance.** Don't achieve professionally while failing personally.

3. **Time horizons connect.** Daily actions should serve lifetime visions.

4. **Goals should pull.** If they don't excite you, revise them.

5. **Review sustains focus.** A goal set and forgotten accomplishes nothing.

---

## Rohn's Goal-Setting Process

1. **Write them down.** Unwritten goals are wishes.
2. **Make them specific.** Vague goals produce vague results.
3. **Add deadlines.** A dream with a deadline is a goal.
4. **Categorize.** Ensure life balance.
5. **Review daily.** Focus requires repetition.
6. **Celebrate achievement.** Reward the accomplishment.
