# Week 36: Self-Discipline (Brahmacharya)

**Quarter:** Q3 — BE
**Mentor:** Mahatma Gandhi
**Theme:** Mastering desires

> "Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will." — Gandhi

## Overview

Gandhi practiced brahmacharya—self-discipline and control over desires. For him, this included fasting, simplicity, and abstinence. The deeper principle: the person who cannot master themselves cannot lead others.

This week examines self-mastery as the foundation of leadership authority.

### Day 4 — The Practice of Fasting
**Morning Meditation:**
> "To a man whose mind is free there is something even more intolerable in the sufferings of others than in his own."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Gandhi fasted as a practice of self-discipline and clarity. What's your equivalent? How do you develop self-mastery through practice?

**CEO Application:**
Consider a mini-fast—from food, technology, or a habit—for one day. Notice what it reveals about your self-discipline.

### Day 5 — Desire and Decision
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Our thoughts become our words, our words become our actions, our actions become our habits, our habits become our character."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How do unchecked desires affect your decisions? Where has wanting (rather than thoughtful analysis) driven choices?

**CEO Application:**
Review a recent decision. How much was driven by desire (wanting) versus deliberation (thinking)? Was that appropriate?

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver."* — Gandhi

The CEO's self-discipline is the organization's ceiling. A leader who can't manage their health, their impulses, or their time will struggle to demand discipline from others.

This isn't about perfection—it's about evident effort. Teams watch whether you practice what you preach. Your self-mastery (or lack of it) is always visible.

Start with one discipline. Master it. Then add another. The compound effect of self-discipline transforms leadership capacity.
