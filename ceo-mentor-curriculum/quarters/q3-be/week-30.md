# Week 30: Work Harder on Yourself Than on Your Job

**Quarter:** Q3 — BE
**Mentor:** Jim Rohn
**Theme:** Personal growth as competitive advantage

> "Work harder on yourself than you do on your job." — Jim Rohn

---

## Overview

Rohn's signature teaching: Your income rarely exceeds your personal development. Work on your job, you make a living. Work on yourself, you make a fortune. The CEO who focuses only on the business neglects the one asset that affects everything else—themselves.

---

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Self as Primary Asset
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Income rarely exceeds personal development."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How much time do you spend improving your business versus improving yourself? What's the ratio?

**CEO Application:**
Track your time this week. How many hours are invested in your personal development versus operational work?

---

### Day 2 — The Ceiling of Self
**Morning Meditation:**
> "For things to change, you have to change. For things to get better, you have to get better."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Your organization has a ceiling, and that ceiling is often you. Where might you be the limiting factor?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one area where your personal limitations constrain organizational growth. What development would raise the ceiling?

---

### Day 3 — Learning as Priority
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What are you learning right now? Not passively absorbing, but actively studying? What's your current learning priority?

**CEO Application:**
Define your top learning priority for the next quarter. What skill, domain, or capability would most advance your goals?

---

### Day 4 — The Reading Imperative
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Miss a meal if you have to, but don't miss a book."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How many books have you read in the last year? How many have directly contributed to your growth and effectiveness?

**CEO Application:**
Set a reading goal. How many books per month? What's the reading time built into your daily routine?

---

### Day 5 — Mentors and Models
**Morning Meditation:**
> "You must take personal responsibility. You cannot change the circumstances, the seasons, or the wind, but you can change yourself."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Who are your current mentors—formal or informal, living or through books? Are they sufficient for your next level?

**CEO Application:**
Evaluate your mentor portfolio. Who do you need that you don't have? How could you access them?

---

### Day 6 — The Development Investment
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The best investment you can make is in yourself."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How much money do you invest in your own development annually? Coaching, courses, conferences, books? Is it proportionate to the return?

**CEO Application:**
Calculate your personal development budget. Is it worthy of your aspirations? What would doubling it enable?

---

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

**Review Questions:**
1. How does your self-development investment compare to other investments?
2. Where are you the ceiling on your organization's growth?
3. What specific development would create the most leverage?

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"Don't wish it were easier, wish you were better. Don't wish for less problems, wish for more skills."* — Jim Rohn

The CEO who works only on the business eventually becomes its limiting factor. The market changes, the team grows, the challenges evolve—and the CEO stays the same.

Work on yourself with the same intensity you work on your business. Your personal development is the lever that moves everything else.
