# Week 28: The Seasons of Life

**Quarter:** Q3 — BE
**Mentor:** Jim Rohn
**Theme:** Navigating inevitable cycles

> "Life and business are like the seasons. You cannot change the seasons, but you can change yourself." — Jim Rohn

---

## Overview

Rohn's mentor Earl Shoaff taught him that life moves in seasons—spring (opportunity), summer (growth), fall (harvest), winter (challenge). Each season requires different strategies. The wise person learns to work with the seasons, not against them.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — The Four Seasons
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Learn how to handle the winters. They come regularly, right after fall. Some are long, some are short, some are difficult, some are easy. But they always come."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What season is your business/life in right now? Spring, summer, fall, or winter? What season are you expecting next?

**CEO Application:**
Assess your current season honestly. Are you applying strategies appropriate for this season, or strategies for a different one?

---

### Day 2 — Winter Wisdom
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Learn how to handle the winters. Don't wish for summer. Instead, get stronger, get better, get wiser."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Think of a difficult "winter" period in your life. What did it teach you? How did it strengthen you?

**CEO Application:**
If you're in winter now: What is this season teaching? If not: What reserves are you building for the next winter?

---

### Day 3 — Spring Opportunity
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Learn how to take advantage of the spring. Opportunity is brief. Take advantage of it while it lasts."

**Reflection Prompt:**
When was your last "spring"—a period of new opportunity? How well did you capitalize on it?

**CEO Application:**
What opportunities exist right now that won't last forever? Are you seizing them with appropriate urgency?

---

### Day 4 — Summer Growth
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Learn how to protect your crops all summer. The bugs and weeds will try to take what you've planted."

**Reflection Prompt:**
During growth periods, threats emerge—competition, complacency, distraction. How do you protect your "crops"?

**CEO Application:**
What's threatening your current growth? Bugs (external threats) or weeds (internal problems)? What protection is needed?

---

### Day 5 — Fall Harvest
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Learn how to reap in the fall without apology. Take full responsibility for your harvest."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How do you handle success? Do you harvest without apology, or do you minimize or feel guilty about it?

**CEO Application:**
What harvest are you entitled to that you're not claiming fully? What would "harvesting without apology" look like?

---

### Day 6 — Working With Seasons
**Morning Meditation:**
> "You cannot change the seasons, but you can change yourself."

**Reflection Prompt:**
The seasons are inevitable—you can't skip winter or extend summer forever. How does accepting this change your approach?

**CEO Application:**
What are you fighting that's simply a season to be endured? What would accepting the season enable?

---

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

**Review Questions:**
1. What season are you in? How confident are you in this assessment?
2. What's the appropriate strategy for this season?
3. How do you need to change yourself to work better with seasons?

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"What happens to you doesn't determine how far you will go in life; how you handle what happens to you is what counts."* — Jim Rohn

The CEO who understands seasons has equanimity. They don't panic in winter or become arrogant in summer. They prepare, they adapt, they persist.

Know your season. Apply the appropriate strategy. And remember: winter doesn't last forever, but neither does summer.
