# Week 38: Simplicity

**Quarter:** Q3 — BE
**Mentor:** Mahatma Gandhi
**Theme:** Eliminating the unnecessary

> "Live simply so that others may simply live." — Gandhi

---

## Overview

Gandhi wore homespun cloth, lived in an ashram, and owned almost nothing at his death. His simplicity wasn't poverty—it was philosophy. Complexity obscures; simplicity reveals. Possessions own you; simplicity frees you.

This week examines where complexity has crept into your life and leadership—and what simplicity could unlock.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — The Weight of Complexity
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs, but not every man's greed."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Where has complexity accumulated in your life? Possessions? Commitments? Relationships? Business processes? What does it cost?

**CEO Application:**
List 5-10 sources of complexity in your work life. For each: What's the benefit? What's the cost?

---

### Day 2 — Simplicity as Clarity
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Truth is by nature self-evident. As soon as you remove the cobwebs of ignorance that surround it, it shines clear."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Complexity often hides confusion. Where might simplifying reveal clearer thinking?

**CEO Application:**
Take one complex strategy or process. Try to explain it in two sentences. Can you? If not, what does that indicate?

---

### Day 3 — Elimination
**Morning Meditation:**
> "There is more to life than increasing its speed."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Gandhi's simplicity came through elimination. What could you eliminate from your life that would create freedom?

**CEO Application:**
Identify three things to eliminate: a possession, a commitment, and a process. What would happen if you did?

---

### Day 4 — Simple Living
**Morning Meditation:**
> "It is the quality of our work which will please God and not the quantity."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How simple is your personal lifestyle? Does your lifestyle serve your purpose, or does it demand service from you?

**CEO Application:**
Audit one area of personal lifestyle (home, possessions, schedule). Where has it become more complex than it needs to be?

---

### Day 5 — Simple Communication
**Morning Meditation:**
> "An ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Simple communication is more powerful than complex communication. Where do you overcomplicate messages?

**CEO Application:**
Review a recent communication. Could it have been said in half the words? What got in the way of simplicity?

---

### Day 6 — Resisting Complexity
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Complexity creeps in constantly. Systems, possessions, commitments accumulate. How do you resist the creep?

**CEO Application:**
Create a practice for maintaining simplicity—regular purges, one-in-one-out rules, complexity budgets. What would work for you?

---

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."* — Leonardo da Vinci

The CEO who masters simplicity has a competitive advantage. Clear strategy beats complex strategy. Simple communication beats verbose communication. Focused efforts beat scattered efforts.

Simplicity is not simplistic. It takes work to find the simple within the complex. But that work creates leverage.

Examine where complexity has crept in. Eliminate what doesn't serve. Simplify what remains.
