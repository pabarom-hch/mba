# Day 6: Service Beyond the Organization

**Week 37 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Mahatma Gandhi**

> "Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs, but not every man's greed."

## The Core Insight

Servant leadership doesn't stop at organizational boundaries. Gandhi saw service extending to all humanity, to future generations, even to the earth itself. CEOs who embrace servant leadership must ask: Who else do we serve beyond our employees, customers, and shareholders? The answer includes communities, the environment, future generations, and the broader human family. Service that stops at the organization's edge isn't servant leadership—it's just good management.

True servant leaders serve beyond themselves, beyond their organization, beyond the present.

## The Expanding Circles of Service

### The Traditional View

**Narrow service circles:**
- Shareholders (owners)
- Customers (revenue source)
- Employees (resources)

**The limitation:**
- Service is transactional
- Boundaries are clear
- Obligations are contractual
- Scope is defined by exchange

### The Servant Leader's View

**Expanding service circles:**
- Employees (as whole persons)
- Customers (as human beings)
- Communities (where we operate)
- Environment (that sustains us)
- Future generations (who inherit our choices)
- Humanity (the larger whole)

**The expansion:**
- Service is relational
- Boundaries are permeable
- Obligations are moral
- Scope is defined by impact

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs, but not every man's greed."

Gandhi articulates a fundamental constraint and choice. There is enough—but only if we serve needs, not greed. Organizations that extract more than their share, that externalize costs, that serve only narrow interests, violate this principle. Servant leaders understand that true service must be sustainable, must serve the whole, must consider all who are affected. Your organization exists within an ecosystem of stakeholders: community, environment, future generations, humanity. Serve them all, and there is enough. Serve only narrow interests, and greed consumes what would sustain everyone. The choice between needs and greed is the choice between sustainable service and destructive extraction.
