## The Complete Goal-Setting Framework

### The Foundation: Why Goals Matter

### The Energy: Pull, Not Push

**The key:**
- Goals should pull you forward

### The Maintenance: Review and Adjust

**The rhythm:**
- Daily: Review twice (morning, evening)

## Key Quote for the Week

> "If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much."

This is Rohn's call to intentional living. Without goals, you don't go nowhere—you go to someone else's destination. Others' plans for you are not grand—they're convenient for them. Design your own plan. Set your own goals. Take control of your trajectory. This is the only way to live your life rather than being swept into others' lives.

## The Goal-Setting Check

**Before moving on, verify:**

□ I have written goals
□ My goals span multiple categories
□ My goals connect across time horizons
□ My goals pull me (or I've reframed them)
□ I have a review rhythm
□ I will celebrate achievements
□ I understand goals are about becoming

If any box is unchecked, address it before proceeding.
