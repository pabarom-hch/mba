## Key Quote for the Week

> "Be the change you wish to see in the world."

This is Gandhi's defining teaching. It's not about preaching what should change—it's about embodying that change. Want more integrity in your organization? Be more integral yourself. Want more courage? Demonstrate courage. Want more service? Serve. The external world reflects the internal world of its leaders. The organization mirrors its CEO. The team reflects its manager. Be the change. It's not a suggestion—it's the only way transformation actually happens. Change yourself, and you've changed your world.
