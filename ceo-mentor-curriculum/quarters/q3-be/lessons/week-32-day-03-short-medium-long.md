# Day 3: Short, Medium, and Long

**Week 32 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "A goal is a dream with a deadline."

---

## The Core Insight

Goals exist at multiple time horizons—short-term (90 days), medium-term (1-3 years), and long-term (5+ years to lifetime). Rohn taught that these horizons must connect: your daily actions should serve your 90-day goals, which serve your yearly goals, which serve your lifetime vision. Disconnected goals are just random aspirations.

The horizons must align.

## The Time Horizons

### Short-Term: 90-Day Goals

**Characteristics:**
- Immediate action required
- Progress visible quickly
- Adjustable and specific
- The execution horizon

**Purpose:**
- Create momentum
- Enable measurement
- Produce quick wins
- Connect to daily action

### Medium-Term: 1-3 Year Goals

**Characteristics:**
- Significant achievement possible
- Requires sustained effort
- Measurable milestones
- The building horizon

**Purpose:**
- Create substantial change
- Develop new capabilities
- Build toward larger vision
- Connect short to long

### Long-Term: 5+ Years to Lifetime

**Characteristics:**
- Visionary scope
- Requires patience
- Major life outcomes
- The direction horizon

**Purpose:**
- Provide ultimate direction
- Keep perspective during difficulty
- Define what success means
- Give meaning to daily effort

---

## The Cascade Principle

### How Horizons Connect

**The chain:**
- Lifetime vision informs 10-year goals
- 10-year goals inform 3-year goals
- 3-year goals inform 1-year goals
- 1-year goals inform 90-day goals
- 90-day goals inform daily actions

**The logic:**
- What you do today should serve 90-day goals
- 90-day achievement should build 1-year goals
- 1-year progress should advance 3-year goals
- All should serve lifetime vision

### When Horizons Don't Connect

**The problem:**
- Daily actions unrelated to goals
- Short-term goals unrelated to long-term
- Effort scattered across random targets
- No coherent trajectory

**The result:**
- Activity without progress
- Busyness without building
- Years pass without advancement
- Disconnect creates confusion

## Setting Goals at Each Horizon

### Lifetime Vision (20+ Years)

**What to consider:**
- Who do you want to become?
- What do you want to have achieved?
- What legacy do you want to leave?
- What would a life well-lived look like?

**How to express:**
- Vision statement
- Ultimate outcomes
- End-state description
- The "so that eventually..." target

### Long-Term Goals (5-10 Years)

**What to consider:**
- Major achievements on the way to vision
- Significant milestones
- Transformations required
- Position to be in

**How to express:**
- Specific outcomes
- Measurable targets
- Clear descriptions
- The "in 10 years I will..." targets

### Medium-Term Goals (1-3 Years)

**What to consider:**
- Building blocks for long-term
- Meaningful progress markers
- Capabilities to develop
- Positions to establish

**How to express:**
- Specific, measurable outcomes
- Clear deadlines
- Defined success criteria
- The "by next year I will..." targets

### Short-Term Goals (90 Days)

**What to consider:**
- Immediate action priorities
- First steps toward medium-term
- Quick wins available
- Momentum builders

**How to express:**
- Very specific targets
- Clear deadlines (within 90 days)
- Action-oriented statements
- The "in 90 days I will..." targets

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Disconnected Goals

Someone with unconnected time horizons:

**Their goals:**
- Lifetime: "Be wealthy and happy"
- 5-year: None
- 1-year: "Lose weight"
- 90-day: "Read more"

**The problem:**
- No connection between horizons
- Daily actions don't serve lifetime
- Wealth goal has no path
- Random aspirations, not aligned goals

**The result:**
- Activity without progress
- Goals achieved randomly
- No sense of building toward something
- Frustration and confusion

**The lesson:**
- Goals must connect
- Each horizon must serve the next
- Random goals produce random results
- Alignment is essential

### Case 2: Connected Goals

A leader with aligned time horizons:

**Their cascade:**
- Lifetime: "Lead a significant company; leave a legacy of developed leaders"
- 10-year: "Be CEO of $100M company known for culture"
- 3-year: "Reach VP level; build exceptional team"
- 1-year: "Promoted to Director; develop 2 high-potential reports"
- 90-day: "Complete leadership program; recommend two reports for advancement"

**The connection:**
- Each horizon serves the next
- Daily actions build 90-day goals
- 90-day builds yearly
- Yearly builds toward lifetime

**The result:**
- Coherent trajectory
- Daily purpose
- Measurable progress
- Lifetime vision advancing

**The lesson:**
- Connected goals create power
- Each action has meaning
- Progress is visible at every level
- The whole is greater than parts

### Case 3: The Cascading CEO

A CEO who mastered the cascade:

**Their practice:**
- Annual: Revisit lifetime vision and long-term goals
- Quarterly: Set 90-day goals that cascade
- Weekly: Review progress toward 90-day
- Daily: Actions tied to weekly priorities

**The system:**
- Vision → 10-year → 3-year → 1-year → 90-day → weekly → daily
- All explicitly connected
- Regular review at each level
- Adjustments cascade through

**The result:**
- Every day had purpose
- Every quarter made progress
- Every year advanced toward lifetime
- Life was building toward vision

**The lesson:**
- Cascading is a system
- Regular review maintains connection
- All horizons stay active
- Living toward vision is possible

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Horizon Audit

**Audit your goal horizons:**

| Horizon | Current Goals | Connected to Next? | Quality (1-10) |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Lifetime vision | | N/A | |
| 10-year | | Y/N | |
| 3-year | | Y/N | |
| 1-year | | Y/N | |
| 90-day | | Y/N | |

### Application 2: Goal Cascade

**Create a cascaded goal set:**

| Horizon | Goal | How It Serves Next Level |
|---------|------|--------------------------|
| Lifetime | | |
| 10-year | | ↑ Serves lifetime by... |
| 3-year | | ↑ Serves 10-year by... |
| 1-year | | ↑ Serves 3-year by... |
| 90-day | | ↑ Serves 1-year by... |

### Application 3: Connection Check

**Check your connections:**

| Daily Actions | Serve 90-Day? | 90-Day Serves Yearly? | Yearly Serves 3-Year? |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N |
| | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N |
| | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N |

### Application 4: Horizon Calendar

**Create a review calendar:**

| Horizon | Review Frequency | When Specifically |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Lifetime/10-year | Annually | |
| 3-year | Semi-annually | |
| 1-year | Quarterly | |
| 90-day | Weekly | |
| Daily actions | Daily | |

## Making the Connection

### From Vision to Daily

**The translation:**
- What does the vision require in 10 years?
- What must be true in 3 years for that 10-year goal?
- What must be true in 1 year for that 3-year goal?
- What must be done in 90 days for that 1-year goal?
- What must be done today for that 90-day goal?

### From Daily to Vision

**The elevation:**
- How does today's action serve 90-day goals?
- How does 90-day progress serve yearly goals?
- How does yearly achievement serve 3-year goals?
- How does 3-year progress serve lifetime vision?

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Cascade Creation

Create your cascade:
1. Start with lifetime vision
2. Work down to 10-year
3. Then 3-year
4. Then 1-year
5. Then 90-day
6. Ensure each connects to the next

### Exercise 2: The Connection Test

Test connections:
1. Pick a daily activity
2. Ask: What 90-day goal does this serve?
3. Ask: What yearly goal does that serve?
4. Continue up the chain
5. If you can't connect, something's wrong

### Exercise 3: The Review System Design

Design your review system:
1. When will you review each horizon?
2. What will you check in each review?
3. How will you adjust when needed?
4. Put it in your calendar
5. Protect the time

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Do you have goals at all time horizons?

2. How well do your short-term goals connect to your long-term vision?

3. When you review your daily actions, do they serve your 90-day goals?

4. When was the last time you reviewed your lifetime vision?

5. What would change if all your horizons were connected?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "A goal is a dream with a deadline."

This is Rohn's goal definition. A dream is nice—but without a deadline, it's just a wish. Add a deadline, and it becomes a goal. This applies at every horizon. Your lifetime vision needs specificity. Your 10-year goals need deadlines. Your 90-day goals need exact dates. Dreams become goals when they have deadlines. Goals at every horizon, with deadlines at every horizon—that's how dreams become reality.
