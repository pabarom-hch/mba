# Day 3: Truth to Self

**Week 34 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Mahatma Gandhi**

> "As long as you derive inner help and comfort from anything, keep it."

## The Core Insight

Before you can be truthful with others, you must be truthful with yourself. Self-deception is the deepest form of untruth—and the hardest to overcome. We all have blind spots, rationalizations, and convenient narratives that protect our ego but distort our understanding. Gandhi's commitment to truth required ruthless self-examination. Real truth-telling begins within.

Self-honesty is the foundation of all honesty.

## The Challenge of Self-Honesty

### Why We Deceive Ourselves

**Ego protection:**

- Assuming competence

**About motivations:**
- "I'm doing this for them"
- "My intentions are pure"

- "They don't really feel that way"
- "The problem is external"

## Key Quote for the Day

> "As long as you derive inner help and comfort from anything, keep it."

This is Gandhi's wisdom about what supports us on the journey—but it also implies that we must honestly examine what we cling to. Some of what we "keep" for comfort is self-deception. We keep comfortable narratives that protect our ego but distort our understanding. The honest question is: Does this help, or does it prevent growth? Does this comfort come from truth, or from avoiding truth? Keep what truly helps. Release what only comforts through deception.
