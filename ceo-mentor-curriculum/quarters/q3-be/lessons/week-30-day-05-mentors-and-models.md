## The Core Insight

Mentors accelerate development by sharing their wisdom, experience, and perspective. They've been where you're going and can guide the journey. Rohn's life was transformed when he met Earl Shoaff, a mentor who challenged his thinking and showed him a better way. The right mentor, at the right time, can change everything.

Mentors compress time.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "You must take personal responsibility. You cannot change the circumstances, the seasons, or the wind, but you can change yourself."

This quote reminds us that while we need mentors, the responsibility for change is ours. Mentors guide, but we must walk. They advise, but we must act. They show the way, but we must travel it. The mentor accelerates your development—but you must do the developing. Take personal responsibility. Change yourself. Let mentors help, but own the journey.
