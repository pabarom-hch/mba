# Day 6: Deliberate Association Design

**Week 31 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "If you want to have more, you have to become more."

## The Core Insight

Most people's associations are accidental—determined by proximity, history, and happenstance. Rohn taught deliberate association: consciously designing who you spend time with rather than leaving it to chance. This is the difference between being shaped by accident and being shaped by intention.

Design your associations. Design your future.

## Accidental vs. Deliberate Association

### Accidental Association

**How it happens:**
- You grew up with them
- You work with them
- They live nearby
- You met randomly

**The pattern:**
- Proximity creates connection
- History maintains connection
- Convenience sustains connection
- No intentional design

**The result:**
- Association portfolio is random
- May or may not serve growth
- Average is determined by accident
- Future is shaped by chance

### Deliberate Association

**How it happens:**
- You choose who to spend time with
- You seek specific people
- You design the environment
- You invest in relationships

**The pattern:**
- Intention creates connection
- Value maintains connection
- Growth sustains connection
- Conscious design

**The result:**
- Association portfolio is curated
- Designed to serve growth
- Average is determined by intention
- Future is shaped by choice

## Designing Your Association Portfolio

### The Ideal Five

**Define your ideal five:**
- Who would be in your ideal five?
- What characteristics would they have?
- What would be normal in this group?
- What average would they create?

### The Association Categories

**Design across categories:**
- Mentors (those ahead of you)
- Peers (those at your level)
- Mentees (those you're developing)
- Specialists (those with specific expertise)

### The Balance

**Consider balance:**
- Challenge and support
- Growth and comfort
- Push and nurture
- Achievement and character

---

## The Design Process

### Step 1: Vision the Ideal

**Ask:**
- Who would I be surrounded by ideally?
- What would they be like?
- How would they influence me?
- What average would they create?

### Step 2: Assess Current State

**Ask:**
- Who am I actually surrounded by?
- What are they like?
- How do they actually influence me?
- What average are they creating?

### Step 3: Identify Gaps

**Ask:**
- Where does reality differ from ideal?
- What's missing?
- What needs to change?
- What's the priority gap?

### Step 4: Plan the Changes

**Ask:**
- Who needs to be added?
- Who needs to be reduced?
- What environments need to change?
- What investment is required?

### Step 5: Execute

**Do:**
- Seek the additions
- Make the reductions
- Join new environments
- Invest the resources

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Designed Circle

A CEO who designed their associations:

**The process:**
- Defined ideal association qualities
- Audited current associations
- Identified gaps
- Created specific plan

**The design:**
- Joined CEO mastermind
- Hired executive coach
- Created advisory board
- Reduced certain friendships

**The execution:**
- Invested time and money
- Built new relationships
- Set boundaries on old ones
- Maintained consistency

**The result:**
- Associations transformed
- Average elevated significantly
- Results followed the upgrade
- Design created destiny

**The lesson:**
- Association can be designed
- It requires intention and investment
- The process is methodical
- Results follow design

### Case 2: The Portfolio Builder

A leader who built an association portfolio:

**The framework:**
- Mentors for direction
- Peers for challenge
- Mentees for teaching (you learn by teaching)
- Specialists for expertise

**The execution:**
- Sought 2-3 mentors actively
- Created peer mastermind
- Took on development responsibilities
- Built specialist network

**The result:**
- Comprehensive support
- Multiple growth vectors
- Balanced influence
- Accelerated development

**The lesson:**
- Portfolio thinking works
- Different roles serve different needs
- Balance creates stability
- Deliberate construction creates value

### Case 3: The Environment Architect

An entrepreneur who changed environments:

**The recognition:**
- Current environments were limiting
- Different environments would elevate
- Environment change would change associations
- Architecture could be designed

**The action:**
- Changed where they worked
- Changed what they attended
- Changed what they joined
- Changed their environment systematically

**The result:**
- New associations naturally formed
- Old associations naturally faded
- Average shifted without confrontation
- Environment did the work

**The lesson:**
- Environment shapes association
- Change environment, change associations
- Architecture can be indirect
- Design can be subtle

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Association Vision

Create your association vision:
1. If you could design your ideal five, who would be there?
2. What characteristics would they have?
3. What would be normal in this group?
4. How would you feel being part of it?
5. Write this vision clearly

### Exercise 2: The Gap Analysis

Analyze the gap:
1. Compare vision to reality
2. What's the biggest gap?
3. Why does the gap exist?
4. What would close it?
5. Prioritize closures

### Exercise 3: The 90-Day Design Plan

Create 90-day plan:
1. Three specific association upgrades
2. Three specific limiter reductions
3. One environment upgrade
4. Specific actions for each
5. Start this week

---

## Reflection Questions

1. How much of your current association is accidental vs. deliberate?

2. What would your ideal five look like, and how far is reality from this?

3. What investment would it take to create your designed association portfolio?

4. What environments could you join that would naturally upgrade your associations?

5. What's the first deliberate association change you'll make?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "If you want to have more, you have to become more."

This is Rohn's growth imperative applied to associations. If you want more—more success, more growth, more impact—you have to become more. And becoming more requires being around more. Your associations are part of what you become. Design them deliberately. If you want to have more, design associations that help you become more.

## Tomorrow's Preview

**Day 7** integrates the week's lessons into a complete association philosophy.
