# Day 7: Weekly Integration

**Week 37 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Mahatma Gandhi**

> "The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."

---

## The Core Insight

This week has explored servant leadership through Gandhi's example and teaching. Service is the purpose of leadership. Leaders serve followers, not the reverse. Service must be visible to shape culture. Growth of followers is the measure of success. Humility means practice over preaching. And service extends beyond organizational boundaries to community, environment, and future generations. Today we integrate these elements into a coherent practice of servant leadership.

Lose yourself in service, and you find your leadership.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."

This paradox captures the essence of servant leadership. The leader who grasps for self—for power, for recognition, for accumulation—loses themselves in the grasping. The leader who loses themselves in service—who makes leadership about others—finds themselves in the losing. This isn't sacrifice as loss; it's sacrifice as discovery. By serving, you find your purpose. By giving, you discover your value. By losing yourself in the growth and wellbeing of others, you find the leader you were meant to be. Gandhi's life exemplified this paradox: he sought nothing for himself and became one of history's most influential leaders. Lose yourself in service, and find your leadership.
