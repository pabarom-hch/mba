# Day 4: Summer Growth

**Week 28 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "Learn how to protect your crops all summer. The bugs and weeds will try to take what you've planted."

## The Core Insight

Summer is the season of growth—what was planted in spring now grows. But summer is not passive. The bugs and weeds of competition, distraction, internal problems, and external threats emerge. Those who assume growth will continue automatically lose their crops. Those who protect and nurture see their investments mature.

Summer requires vigilance, not coasting.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Learn how to protect your crops all summer. The bugs and weeds will try to take what you've planted."

This is the summer imperative. Success isn't just planting—it's protecting. What you planted in spring is growing, but so are the threats. Bugs (external threats) and weeds (internal problems) will try to take what you've built. They don't announce themselves—they just grow alongside your crops. Vigilance is required. Protection is essential. Summer success goes to the defender, not the coaster.
