# Day 4: Consistency

**Week 33 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Mahatma Gandhi**

> "Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony."

---

## The Core Insight

Gandhi taught that integrity means being the same person in all contexts. True character is consistent—the same whether watched or unwatched, in public or private, with the powerful or the powerless. Inconsistency between contexts reveals inauthenticity. Consistency creates trust. When who you are doesn't change with the audience, people know they can rely on you.

Integrity is wholeness across contexts.

## The Three Harmonies

### Think-Say-Do Alignment

**Gandhi's formula:**
- What you think = your beliefs
- What you say = your words
- What you do = your actions
- Harmony = all three aligned

**The test:**
- Do you say what you think?
- Do you do what you say?
- Does your thinking match your doing?
- Are all three in harmony?

### What Misalignment Looks Like

**Think-say gap:**
- Thinking one thing, saying another
- Strategic positioning
- Political messaging
- Hidden agenda

**Say-do gap:**
- Promising but not delivering
- Words without actions
- Commitments not kept
- Hypocrisy

**Think-do gap:**
- Believing one thing, doing another
- Values-behavior disconnect
- Rationalized compromise
- Self-deception

## Consistency Across Contexts

### The Same Person Everywhere

**What consistency means:**
- Same with board and with janitor
- Same in public and private
- Same under pressure and in calm
- Same when watched and unwatched

**What consistency requires:**
- Knowing who you are
- Commitment to authenticity
- Courage to be consistent
- Integration of self

### Common Inconsistencies

**Context switching:**
- Professional persona vs. home persona
- Powerful audience vs. powerless audience
- High stakes vs. low stakes
- Public vs. private

**The problem:**
- People notice the switches
- Trust is damaged
- Authenticity is questioned
- Which is the "real" you?

---

## The Cost of Inconsistency

### Trust Destruction

**What happens:**
- People don't know what to expect
- Reliability is questioned
- Predictability is lost
- Trust erodes

**The pattern:**
- Inconsistency observed
- "Which version is real?"
- Assume the worse version
- Trust the better version less

### Personal Fragmentation

**Internal cost:**
- Managing multiple personas
- Energy spent on switching
- Losing track of authentic self
- Stress of inauthenticity

**The exhaustion:**
- Context switching is tiring
- Keeping track of versions drains
- Authenticity is restful
- Fragmentation is depleting

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Context Switcher

A leader with different personas:

**The pattern:**
- With board: strategic, measured
- With team: casual, friendly
- With vendors: tough, demanding
- With media: polished, careful

**The problem:**
- Team saw the switches
- Wondered which was real
- Trusted none of them
- Couldn't rely on any version

**The result:**
- Trust was low across groups
- People compared notes
- Authenticity questioned
- Leadership undermined

**The lesson:**
- Multiple personas breed distrust
- People compare across contexts
- Inconsistency signals inauthenticity
- One person is more trustworthy than many

### Case 2: The Consistent Leader

A CEO the same everywhere:

**Their practice:**
- Same communication style with all
- Same values in all contexts
- Same under pressure as in calm
- Same public and private

**The specifics:**
- Direct with board AND with intern
- Respectful with CEO peers AND with service staff
- Calm in crisis AND in routine
- Private behavior matched public image

**The result:**
- High trust from all levels
- Predictability valued
- Authenticity evident
- "What you see is what you get"

**The lesson:**
- Consistency builds trust
- Same-everywhere creates reliability
- Authenticity is visible
- One integrated person inspires confidence

### Case 3: The Pressure Revealer

A leader whose consistency broke under pressure:

**Normally:**
- Calm, respectful, measured
- Aligned with stated values
- Consistent behavior
- Good example

**Under pressure:**
- Different person emerged
- Sharp, dismissive, harsh
- Values abandoned
- True character revealed

**The result:**
- People waited for pressure moments
- That person was the "real" person
- Trust in normal persona destroyed
- Pressure revealed truth

**The lesson:**
- Pressure reveals character
- Calm-time consistency isn't enough
- People judge by worst moments
- Must be consistent especially under stress

**Pressure preparation:**
- Values clear before pressure comes
- Practiced responses to stress
- Commitments made in advance
- Character decided, not situational

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony."

This is Gandhi's formula for integration. Happiness—deep satisfaction, not fleeting pleasure—comes from alignment. When your thoughts, words, and actions are all pointing the same direction, there is no internal conflict. No energy spent managing contradictions. No anxiety about being discovered. Just the peace of wholeness. This harmony IS integrity. The word "integrity" comes from "integer"—a whole number, complete in itself. Be whole. Be the same. Be in harmony with yourself.
