# Day 5: Review and Adjustment

**Week 32 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "Review your goals twice every day in order to be focused on achieving them."

---

## The Core Insight

Goals set and forgotten accomplish nothing. The difference between goals that work and goals that don't is often not the goal itself but the attention paid to it. Rohn advocated reviewing goals twice daily—morning and evening—to maintain focus and make continuous progress. Review keeps goals alive; neglect lets them die.

What you review, you remember. What you remember, you pursue.

## Why Review Matters

### Focus Maintenance

**Without review:**
- Goals fade from memory
- Daily urgencies take over
- Focus scatters
- Goals become forgotten files

**With review:**
- Goals stay present
- Daily actions align
- Focus maintains
- Goals guide decisions

### Progress Awareness

**Without review:**
- Progress is invisible
- Success isn't recognized
- Gaps aren't noticed
- Drift isn't caught

**With review:**
- Progress is tracked
- Success is celebrated
- Gaps are identified
- Corrections are made

### Motivation Renewal

**Without review:**
- Initial excitement fades
- Why you started is forgotten
- Motivation depletes
- Goals become burdens

**With review:**
- Excitement is renewed
- Purpose is remembered
- Motivation refreshes
- Goals remain attractive

## Adjustment Principles

### When to Adjust

- Short-term difficulties arise
- You want an excuse to quit

### How to Adjust

**The right way:**
- Based on data, not feeling
- After sufficient effort
- With honest assessment
- While maintaining commitment

**The wrong way:**
- Based on mood
- At first difficulty
- As avoidance
- As subtle quitting

### What to Adjust

**Adjustable:**
- Tactics and methods

- Intermediate goals
- Approach

**Not easily adjustable:**

- Ultimate destination
- Fundamental purpose
- Values

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Goals Never Reviewed

A professional whose goals died from neglect:

**The pattern:**
- Set goals in January
- Didn't review until December
- Forgot what they were
- Made no progress

**What happened:**
- Year passed without intention
- Same place at end as beginning
- Goals were irrelevant
- Basically goalless year

**The result:**
- No achievement
- No transformation
- No focus
- Wasted year

**The lesson:**
- Unreviewed goals are not goals
- Set and forget is failure
- Review is required
- Attention determines achievement

### Case 2: Goals Reviewed Daily

A CEO with rigorous review practice:

**The practice:**
- Morning: 5 minutes with goals
- Evening: 5 minutes assessing progress
- Weekly: 30-minute deep review
- Quarterly: Full goal revision

**What happened:**
- Goals always present in mind
- Daily actions aligned naturally
- Progress visible constantly
- Adjustments made quickly

**The result:**
- High achievement rate
- No forgotten goals
- Continuous improvement
- Sense of direction

**The lesson:**
- Review keeps goals alive
- Daily attention creates focus
- Consistency compounds
- Achievement follows attention

### Case 3: Adjustment Done Right

A leader who adjusted wisely:

**The situation:**
- Set ambitious goal
- Pursued vigorously
- Learned that market had changed
- Original goal no longer made sense

**The decision:**
- Reviewed data honestly
- Recognized the change
- Adjusted goal without abandoning commitment
- Set new goal aligned with reality

**The result:**
- Achieved adjusted goal
- Didn't waste effort on obsolete target
- Remained committed
- Adjusted without quitting

**The lesson:**

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Review your goals twice every day in order to be focused on achieving them."

This is Rohn's review imperative. Not occasionally—twice daily. Morning and evening. The frequency matters because it keeps goals present. It prevents the fade that kills goals. Focus is the mechanism: review creates focus, focus creates action, action creates achievement. Twice daily review isn't obsessive—it's essential. Goals that aren't reviewed become wishes that fade.
