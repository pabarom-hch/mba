# Day 6: Inner Violence

**Week 35 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Mahatma Gandhi**

> "Non-violence is not a garment to be put on and off at will. Its seat is in the heart."

## The Core Insight

Ahimsa begins within. Before we can practice non-violence with others, we must practice it with ourselves. Inner violence—harsh self-criticism, unrealistic expectations, no rest, no compassion—poisons everything. You cannot give what you don't have. If you treat yourself violently, that violence will leak into your treatment of others. Self-compassion is not self-indulgence; it's the foundation of genuine ahimsa.

Outer non-violence requires inner non-violence.

## What Inner Violence Looks Like

### Harsh Self-Criticism

**The pattern:**
- Brutal internal dialogue
- Constant self-attack
- No acknowledgment of effort
- Only notice of failure

**The language:**
- "You're so stupid"
- "You always fail"
- "You're not good enough"
- "What's wrong with you?"

### Unrealistic Expectations

**The pattern:**
- Impossible standards
- No room for human limits
- Perfection demanded
- Any less is failure

**The thinking:**
- "I should be able to do more"
- "This should be easier"
- "I shouldn't need rest"
- "I shouldn't make mistakes"

### No Rest, No Compassion

**The pattern:**
- Constant driving
- No recovery allowed
- Exhaustion ignored
- Self-care dismissed

**The behavior:**
- Work without breaks
- Ignore body signals
- No time for renewal
- Burnout as badge

### Unforgiveness of Self

**The pattern:**
- Holding onto past mistakes
- Constant revisiting of failures
- No self-forgiveness
- Permanent self-punishment

**The thinking:**
- "I should have known better"
- "I can't forgive myself"
- "I don't deserve success"
- "I'll always fail"

## The Cost of Inner Violence

### Personal Damage

**What happens:**
- Mental health suffers
- Physical health deteriorates
- Joy disappears
- Life becomes punishment

**The erosion:**
- Chronic stress
- Anxiety and depression
- Burnout
- Health breakdown

### Leadership Damage

**How it leaks:**
- Harshness with others
- Impossible expectations projected
- No space for others' humanity
- Violence normalized

**The pattern:**
- Violent with self → Violent with others
- No self-compassion → No compassion for others
- Unrealistic self-expectations → Unrealistic team expectations
- Inner brutality becomes outer brutality

### Ahimsa Undermined

**The contradiction:**
- Claiming to practice ahimsa
- While violating yourself
- The garment on and off
- Not seated in the heart

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Non-violence is not a garment to be put on and off at will. Its seat is in the heart."

This is Gandhi's teaching on the authenticity of ahimsa. You cannot practice non-violence as an external technique while harboring violence within. Ahimsa must be seated in the heart—lived internally before it can be genuine externally. If you are violent with yourself, the "non-violence" you show others is a garment that will slip. True ahimsa starts in your relationship with yourself. From that seat in the heart, it flows outward. Without that foundation, it's just performance.
