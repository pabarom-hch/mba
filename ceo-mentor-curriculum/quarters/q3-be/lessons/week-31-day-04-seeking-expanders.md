# Day 4: Seeking Expanders

**Week 31 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "It's better to hang out with people better than you. Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you'll drift in that direction."

---

## The Core Insight

Disassociating from limiters creates space—but space alone isn't enough. The space must be filled with expanders, people who are ahead of you, challenge you, and raise your standards. Rohn taught that you should deliberately seek people better than you, because you'll drift in their direction.

Seek those ahead. You'll rise to meet them.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "It's better to hang out with people better than you. Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you'll drift in that direction."

This is Rohn's upward drift principle. Hang out with people better than you—you'll drift in their direction. The drift is automatic. You don't have to try to become like them; proximity does the work. But you have to get proximate. Pick out associates whose behavior is better. Seek them deliberately. Be around them consistently. The drift will do the rest.
