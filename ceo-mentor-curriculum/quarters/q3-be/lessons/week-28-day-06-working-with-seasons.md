# Day 6: Working With Seasons

**Week 28 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "You cannot change the seasons, but you can change yourself."

---

## The Core Insight

The seasons are what they are—you can't make winter shorter or summer longer. Fighting the seasons is futile. But you can change yourself: your response, your preparation, your strategy, your mindset. Rohn taught that the master of seasons doesn't try to control what's uncontrollable but instead focuses entirely on what is: themselves.

Accept the seasons. Change yourself.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "You cannot change the seasons, but you can change yourself."

This is the complete seasonal wisdom in one sentence. Two parts: acceptance and action. You cannot change the seasons—they are what they are, they come when they come, they last how long they last. Stop fighting this. But you can change yourself—your preparation, response, strategy, capability, mindset. Focus here. All your power is here. The seasons will be what they will be. Who you become is up to you.
