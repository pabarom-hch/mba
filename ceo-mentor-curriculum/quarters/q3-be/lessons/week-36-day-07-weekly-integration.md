## The Week in Review

This week explored Gandhi's teaching on brahmacharya—self-discipline as the foundation of leadership capacity.

| Day | Topic | Core Concept |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| 1 | The Leader's Self-Mastery | Master yourself before leading others |
| 2 | Mastering Impulses | Create the gap between impulse and action |
| 3 | Discipline as Freedom | Constraints create capacity |
| 4 | The Practice of Fasting | Strategic self-denial builds mastery |
| 5 | Desire and Decision | Desires inform, deliberation decides |
| 6 | Modeling Self-Discipline | Your discipline is their curriculum |

## The Complete Self-Discipline Framework

### The Foundation: Self-Mastery First

**Key realizations:**
- Leadership requires self-leadership
- The undisciplined cannot demand discipline
- Self-mastery is the foundation
- Character is the leader's ceiling

### The Mechanism: The Impulse Gap

**Key practice:**
- Impulses arise (that's human)
- The gap between impulse and action is where mastery lives
- Create the gap through awareness
- Choose response rather than react

### The Paradox: Discipline Creates Freedom

**Key understanding:**
- Discipline seems like constraint
- Actually creates capacity
- Freedom through discipline, not from it
- Constraints enable

### The Practice: Strategic Self-Denial

**Key development:**
- Fasting (or equivalent) builds will
- Voluntary doing-without reveals attachment
- Practice develops mastery
- What you can give up, you control

### The Integration: Desire and Deliberation

**Key balance:**
- Desires inform about wants
- Deliberation decides wisely
- Neither alone is enough
- Integration is mastery

### The Visibility: Modeling Teaches

**Key awareness:**
- Your discipline is observed
- It teaches your team
- Culture follows leader
- Model what you expect

|----------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Anger | | | |
| Impatience | | | |
| Distraction | | | |
| Comfort-seeking | | | |

### Part 3: Discipline Practice

**Plan your discipline practice:**

| Discipline to Develop | Specific Practice | Frequency | Start Date |
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Key Quote for the Week

> "Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will."

This is Gandhi's definition of true strength. Not physical power—will. The will that can resist impulse. The will that can choose discipline. The will that can do without when needed. The will that cannot be dominated by desire or comfort or fear. This indomitable will is what self-discipline builds. Each practice of discipline strengthens the will. Each choice of response over reaction builds the muscle. Strength comes from will—and will comes from practice.
