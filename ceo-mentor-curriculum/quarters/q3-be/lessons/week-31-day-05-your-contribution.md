# Day 5: Your Contribution

**Week 31 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "Let others lead small lives, but not you. Let others argue over small things, but not you. Let others cry over small hurts, but not you."

## The Core Insight

You're not just influenced by others—you're in someone else's five. You shape those around you just as they shape you. The question isn't just "Who influences me?" but "What influence am I?" Rohn challenged: Are you an expander for others, or are you someone's limiter?

Be for others what you want for yourself.

## You're In Someone's Five

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Let others lead small lives, but not you. Let others argue over small things, but not you. Let others cry over small hurts, but not you."

This is Rohn's call to greatness—for yourself and for others. Don't lead a small life. Don't argue over small things. Don't be stopped by small hurts. Rise above. And as you do, help others rise too. Let your life be an expanding force for everyone around you. You're in someone's five. Make it count.
