# Day 4: The Practice of Fasting

**Week 36 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Mahatma Gandhi**

> "To a man whose mind is free there is something even more intolerable in the sufferings of others than in his own."

## The Core Insight

Gandhi practiced fasting as a discipline for clarity and self-mastery. By voluntarily choosing to do without, he strengthened his will, cleared his mind, and demonstrated that he was not controlled by appetites. Fasting—or its equivalent in any domain—is a practice of strategic self-denial that builds mastery and reveals what controls you.

Fasting reveals and develops self-mastery.

## The Principle Behind Fasting

### Voluntary Self-Denial

**The core idea:**
- Choose to do without something
- Something you want or are attached to
- For a defined period
- To build mastery

**What it reveals:**
- What controls you
- How strong your will is
- What you're attached to
- Where mastery is needed

### The Fasting Equivalent

**Beyond food:**
- Technology fast (no phone, no email)
- Entertainment fast (no TV, no social media)
- Comfort fast (cold showers, early rising)
- Habit fast (give up a habitual comfort)

**The principle:**
- Whatever you're attached to
- Whatever you think you "need"
- Try doing without it
- See what happens

## What Fasting Teaches

### About Yourself

**You learn:**
- What actually controls you
- How strong your will is
- Where your attachments are
- What you can do without

**The discovery:**
- Often you need less than you think
- Comfort is often habit, not necessity
- Will can be strengthened
- Mastery is possible

### About Leadership

**You learn:**
- Self-denial builds credibility
- Mastery over desires creates trust
- Leaders who control themselves can lead others
- Discipline demonstrated is discipline inspiring

**The insight:**
- If you can fast from comfort, you can demand sacrifice
- If you control your appetites, you can be trusted with power
- Visible self-denial builds authority
- Mastery proves readiness to lead

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Attachment Inventory

**Inventory your attachments:**

| What I Think I "Need" | Could I Fast From It? | What Would It Reveal? |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| | Y/N | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Application 2: Mini-Fast Design

**Design a mini-fast:**

| What to Fast From | Duration | Purpose | Start Date |
|-------------------|----------|---------|------------|
| | | | |

### Application 3: Fast Reflection

**Reflect on past fasts (or lack thereof):**

| Time I Did Without | What I Learned | What Changed |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| | | |
| | | |

### Application 4: This Week's Fast

**Commit to a fast this week:**

| Fasting From | For How Long | What I'll Observe |

| | | |

## Key Quote for the Day

> "To a man whose mind is free there is something even more intolerable in the sufferings of others than in his own."

This is Gandhi's reflection on what a free mind creates. When your mind is free—from attachment, from compulsion, from control by desires—you become more capable of caring for others. Self-mastery doesn't lead to selfishness; it leads to greater capacity for service. Fasting frees the mind. And a free mind, not consumed by its own appetites, can attend to the needs of others.
