## Key Quote for the Week

> "Truth never damages a cause that is just."

This is Gandhi's faith in truth. If your cause is just, truth can only help it. It's only when the cause is unjust that truth becomes threatening. The fear of truth is often a signal that something is wrong with what we're protecting. A just cause welcomes examination, inquiry, and honesty. It has nothing to hide. It only benefits from truth. The leader with a just cause embraces truth absolutely. The leader who fears truth should examine what they're protecting.
