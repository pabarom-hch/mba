# Day 1: The Five People

**Week 31 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with."

---

## The Core Insight

This is Rohn's most quoted teaching—and one of the most powerful. The people you spend time with shape you more than willpower, intention, or self-discipline. Their standards become yours. Their expectations become yours. Their thinking becomes yours. If you want to change who you become, examine who you're becoming like.

Environment shapes identity.

## The Five People Principle

### The Mathematics of Influence

**The averaging effect:**
- Income tends to average toward your five
- Fitness tends to average toward your five
- Ambition tends to average toward your five
- Values tend to average toward your five

**Why this happens:**
- Social pressure (conscious and unconscious)
- Normalization (what's normal is what's around)
- Exposure (you see what they see)
- Conversation (you discuss what they discuss)

### The Identification

**Your five are:**
- The people you spend the most time with
- Not who you wish you spent time with
- Not who you admire from afar
- The actual hours-spent reality

**They shape you through:**
- What they expect of you
- What they assume is possible
- What they talk about
- How they respond to you

## How Associations Shape You

### Through Expectations

**How it works:**
- Others expect you to behave a certain way
- You tend to meet expectations
- High expectations pull you up
- Low expectations let you coast

**The implication:**
- Be around people who expect greatness
- Their expectations become your standards
- You rise (or fall) to the norm

### Through Normalization

**How it works:**
- What's normal around you feels normal to you
- Exceptional becomes expected
- Mediocre becomes acceptable
- Normal is defined by surroundings

**The implication:**
- Find where excellence is normal
- Mediocrity as normal is dangerous
- Your norm is set by your five

### Through Conversation

**How it works:**
- You talk about what they talk about
- Ideas are shared and absorbed
- Vocabulary expands or contracts
- Thinking patterns transfer

**The implication:**
- Conversation topics reveal trajectory
- Small talk creates small thinking
- Big conversations create big thinking

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Average of Mediocrity

A professional whose five held them back:

**Their five:**
- Comfortable friends from past
- Colleagues who were content
- People who had stopped growing
- No one who challenged them

**What happened:**
- Standards normalized to average
- Ambition seemed unrealistic
- Growth felt unnecessary
- Settled into mediocrity

**The result:**
- Became the average of the five
- Potential unrealized
- Comfortable but unfulfilled
- Years of stagnation

**The lesson:**
- The average happens automatically
- Comfort becomes conformity
- The five are the ceiling
- Environment determines trajectory

### Case 2: The Average of Excellence

An entrepreneur who upgraded associations:

**Their five:**
- People 5-10 years ahead
- Ambitious, growing individuals
- High performers in their fields
- People who challenged them

**What happened:**
- Standards normalized to excellence
- Their ambition felt normal
- Growth was expected
- Rising was natural

**The result:**
- Became the average of excellence
- Potential realized
- Challenged and fulfilled
- Continuous growth

**The lesson:**
- Excellence is also an average
- Environment pulls you up
- The five are the floor, not ceiling
- Association determines destination

### Case 3: The Deliberate Change

A leader who changed their five:

**Before:**
- Old friends who weren't growing
- Colleagues who were comfortable
- Family who meant well but limited
- No one to stretch them

**The shift:**
- Joined a CEO peer group
- Found mentors ahead of them
- Sought friendships with high performers
- Deliberate association design

**After:**
- New standards emerged
- New conversations happened
- New thinking developed
- New results appeared

**The lesson:**
- The five can be changed
- Deliberate beats accidental
- Upgrade associations, upgrade self
- It requires intention

| 1. | | | |
| 2. | | | |
| 3. | | | |
| 4. | | | |
| 5. | | | |

**What's your average moving toward?**

### Application 2: Influence Assessment

**Assess each person's influence:**

| Person | What They Expect of Me | What's Normal to Them | What We Talk About |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 3: Trajectory Prediction

**Predict where your five lead:**

| Dimension | Average of Your Five | Where This Leads in 5 Years | Acceptable? |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Income | | | Y/N |
| Ambition | | | Y/N |
| Health | | | Y/N |
| Values | | | Y/N |
| Growth | | | Y/N |

### Application 4: Ideal Five Design

## Examining Your Five

### Questions for Each Person

**Ask about each:**
- What do they value?
- What do they aspire to?
- What do they talk about?
- How do they spend their time?
- What standards do they maintain?
- What do they expect from me?

### The Honest Assessment

**Be brutally honest:**
- Not who you wish they were
- Not their potential
- Their actual influence on you
- The reality of the relationship

### The Pattern Recognition

**Look for patterns:**
- What's the dominant conversation?
- What's the dominant aspiration level?
- What's the dominant expectation?
- What's the dominant trajectory?

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Time Audit

Audit your actual time:
1. Track time spent with people for one week
2. List everyone by hours spent
3. Identify your actual top five
4. Be honest about who's really there
5. Assess the average they create

### Exercise 2: The Influence Map

Map the influence:
1. For each of your five
2. Note their income, ambition, values
3. Note what's normal to them
4. Note what they expect of you
5. See your average forming

### Exercise 3: The Trajectory Projection

Project forward:
1. If nothing changes in your five
2. Where will you be in 5 years?
3. 10 years?
4. Is this acceptable?
5. What must change?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Who are your actual five people—based on time, not wish?

2. What average are they creating for you?

3. Do they expect greatness from you, or something less?

4. What's normal in your circle? Is it excellence?

5. If you became the average of these five, would you be satisfied?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with."

This is Rohn's most famous and actionable insight. Not a vague influence—an average. You move toward the mean of your five. Their income, ambition, values, expectations—you average toward them. This is both warning and opportunity. If your five are extraordinary, you'll move toward extraordinary. If they're mediocre, you'll move toward mediocre. The choice of association is the choice of direction.
