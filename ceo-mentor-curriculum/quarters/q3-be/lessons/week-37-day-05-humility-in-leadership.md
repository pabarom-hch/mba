# Day 5: Humility in Leadership

**Week 37 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Mahatma Gandhi**

> "An ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching."

## The Core Insight

Humility isn't thinking less of yourself; it's thinking of yourself less. For leaders, humility means letting your actions speak louder than your words, crediting others for success, and acknowledging your own limitations. Gandhi understood that authentic leadership comes from practice, not pronouncement. The humble leader serves through action, leads by example, and measures themselves by what they do, not what they say.

Practice humility. Don't preach it.

## Reflection Questions

1. If someone measured your leadership by your practice rather than your preaching, what would they conclude?

2. How do you distribute credit when things go well and blame when things go poorly?

3. When did you last say "I don't know" or "I was wrong"?

4. What do your actions teach about humility, regardless of what your words say?

5. What would change if you practiced an ounce more and preached a ton less?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "An ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching."

Gandhi cuts through all leadership rhetoric with this statement. It doesn't matter what values you articulate, what vision you cast, what behaviors you demand. What matters is what you do. One small act of humble service outweighs endless speeches about servant leadership. One genuine admission of error teaches more than seminars on accountability. One moment of crediting others creates more culture than policies about recognition. Humble leaders understand this: their practice is their only real sermon. The question isn't what you preach about humility—it's what ounce of humble practice you'll demonstrate today.
