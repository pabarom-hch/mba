# Day 4: The Reading Imperative

**Week 30 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "Miss a meal if you have to, but don't miss a book."

---

## The Core Insight

Reading is the most accessible, highest-return development activity available. Books contain the distilled wisdom of great minds—decades of experience, years of reflection, concentrated insight. Rohn read voraciously and credited books with transforming his life. His imperative was clear: miss a meal if you have to, but don't miss a book.

Reading is non-negotiable.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Miss a meal if you have to, but don't miss a book."

This is Rohn's reading priority in a sentence. A meal can be missed—you'll eat later, no real harm. A book missed is knowledge not gained, connection not made, insight not received. The priority is clear: books matter more than meals. Of course you'll eat. But will you read? Miss a meal if you have to—but don't miss the book. Reading is that important.
