# Day 7: Q3 Complete Integration

**Week 39 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn & Mahatma Gandhi**

> "My life is my message." — Mahatma Gandhi

---

## The Core Insight

This is the final day of Q3—thirteen weeks devoted to the art of being. You've studied with Jim Rohn, the practical philosopher of achievement, and Mahatma Gandhi, the moral philosopher of character. Today we complete the integration, summarize all you've learned, and prepare you for Q4 LEAD with Nelson Mandela and John Maxwell. Q3 has been about who you are. Q4 will be about how you lead.

Your being is the foundation; your leading will be the expression.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "My life is my message." — Gandhi

This quote captures the essence of Q3. All the philosophy, disciplines, development, associations, and goals (Rohn) matter only as they shape who you are. All the example, truth, non-violence, self-mastery, service, and legacy (Gandhi) are expressed in how you live. Your life is your message. Not your words. Not your intentions. Not your plans. Your life. After 13 weeks of study and practice, the question remains: What message is your life sending? This is the ultimate integration. This is the foundation for Q4. This is the meaning of BE.
