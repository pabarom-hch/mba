# Day 6: Q3 Achievement Assessment

**Week 39 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn & Mahatma Gandhi**

> "In a gentle way, you can shake the world." — Mahatma Gandhi

---

## The Core Insight

Before we complete Q3 tomorrow, today we pause to assess. Thirteen weeks ago, you began this quarter on "BE"—the foundation of character and being. You've studied with Jim Rohn and Mahatma Gandhi, two mentors who approached leadership from different angles but arrived at the same destination: who you are matters more than what you do. Today we measure your growth.

Assessment without action is vanity; action without assessment is blind.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "In a gentle way, you can shake the world." — Gandhi

This quote reminds us that assessment is not about harsh self-judgment but gentle, honest evaluation. You can shake your own world—transform your leadership—through gentle, consistent effort. The assessment is not meant to discourage but to illuminate. See clearly where you are, and you can move toward where you want to be. Gentle assessment leads to powerful action. Shake your world by seeing it clearly.
