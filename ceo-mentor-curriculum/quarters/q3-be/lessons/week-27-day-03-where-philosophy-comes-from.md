# Day 3: Where Philosophy Comes From

**Week 27 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "Things that I felt absolutely sure of a few years ago, I don't believe anymore. This thought keeps me open to new information."

## The Core Insight

Your philosophy didn't appear from nowhere. It was shaped by family, culture, experience, education, and influences you may not have chosen. Rohn taught that understanding where your beliefs came from is the first step to changing them. Most people operate on inherited or accidental philosophy—never examining its source.

You can't change what you don't understand.

## Sources of Philosophy

### Family of Origin

**How it shapes philosophy:**
- First beliefs are absorbed, not chosen
- Parents' philosophy becomes child's default
- Family values become assumed truth
- Patterns repeat across generations

**What gets transmitted:**
- Views on money ("Rich people are dishonest")
- Views on work ("Hard work never killed anyone")
- Views on relationships ("You can't trust anyone")
- Views on self ("Our family isn't good at...")

**The question:**
- What did you learn about life from your family?
- Which beliefs have you kept? Which rejected?
- What's operating that you've never examined?

### Culture and Society

**How it shapes philosophy:**
- Cultural norms become personal norms
- Society's values become your values
- What "everyone knows" seems true
- Collective beliefs feel like facts

**What gets transmitted:**
- Ideas about success and failure
- Attitudes toward wealth and poverty
- Expectations about life trajectory
- Assumptions about what's possible

**The question:**
- What cultural beliefs do you hold?
- Have you examined them, or just absorbed them?
- Are they serving you or limiting you?

### Personal Experience

**How it shapes philosophy:**
- Events create interpretations
- Interpretations become beliefs
- Beliefs generalize from specifics
- Past shapes expected future

**What gets transmitted:**
- "I failed at X, so I'm not good at things like X"
- "This worked before, so it's the right approach"
- "People let me down, so people can't be trusted"
- Past events become future prophecies

**The question:**
- What experiences shaped your key beliefs?
- Did you interpret those experiences correctly?
- Are generalizations from then valid now?

### Education and Reading

**How it shapes philosophy:**
- Ideas from books become beliefs
- Teachers' perspectives become students'
- Formal education frames thinking
- Learning creates mental models

**What gets transmitted:**
- Ways of thinking about problems
- Frameworks for understanding
- Assumptions from teachers and authors
- Paradigms that may or may not fit

**The question:**
- What ideas from education still shape you?
- Are they current or outdated?
- What have you learned since that contradicts them?

### Mentors and Influences

**How it shapes philosophy:**
- People you admire shape your thinking
- Their beliefs become your beliefs
- Their success validates their philosophy
- You absorb through relationship

**What gets transmitted:**
- Ways of seeing the world
- Approaches to challenges
- Values and priorities
- Operating philosophies

**The question:**
- Whose philosophy have you adopted?
- Does it serve you as it served them?
- Is it yours, or are you borrowing?

## Inherited vs. Chosen Philosophy

### Inherited Philosophy

**Characteristics:**
- Absorbed without examination
- Feels like "just the way things are"
- Often unconscious
- May or may not serve you

**How to identify:**
- Beliefs you've never questioned
- Assumptions you can't explain
- Values you can't justify
- Patterns you can't trace

### Chosen Philosophy

**Characteristics:**
- Examined and selected consciously
- Tested against reality
- Aligned with goals
- Serves your purposes

**How to create:**
- Examine inherited beliefs
- Test against experience and logic
- Keep what serves, discard what doesn't
- Consciously adopt what works

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Inherited Scarcity

An entrepreneur with inherited money philosophy:

**The inherited belief:**
- "There's never enough money"
- "We're not the kind of people who..."
- "Money is hard to come by"

**Where it came from:**
- Parents who struggled financially
- Scarcity messaging in childhood
- Family story of limitation

**How it limited:**
- Underpriced services
- Avoided wealth-building
- Felt guilty about success
- Self-sabotaged

**The examination:**
- Realized the belief's source
- Questioned its validity
- Chose new philosophy
- Results transformed

### Case 2: The Cultural Assumption

A CEO with cultural work philosophy:

**The inherited belief:**
- "Work should be hard and joyless"
- "Suffering is noble"
- "Enjoyment is suspicious"

**Where it came from:**
- Cultural work ethic
- Role models who ground themselves down
- Praise for suffering, not results

**How it limited:**
- Burnout without joy
- Productivity without purpose
- Success without satisfaction

**The examination:**
- Saw the cultural source
- Questioned its necessity
- Observed alternatives
- Chose new philosophy

### Case 3: The Experience Generalization

A leader with experience-based philosophy:

**The inherited belief:**
- "You can't trust people"
- "People will let you down"
- "Better to do it yourself"

**Where it came from:**
- A few painful betrayals
- Generalized from specifics
- Protection mechanism

**How it limited:**
- Couldn't delegate
- Couldn't build team
- Isolated and overwhelmed
- Bottleneck on everything

**The examination:**
- Traced back to specific events
- Realized generalization was flawed
- Not all people are those people
- Chose new, nuanced philosophy

| About success | | |
| About failure | | |
| About money | | |
| About work | | |
| About people | | |
| About self | | |

### Application 2: Inherited Inventory

**List beliefs you've never examined:**

| Inherited Belief | From Whom/What | Still Valid? | Keep or Change |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| | | Y/N/? | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 3: Experience Generalizations

**Check generalizations from experience:**

| Belief | Original Experience | Generalization Valid? | More Accurate Belief |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| | | Y/N | |
| | | | |

### Application 4: Influence Audit

**Audit your philosophical influences:**

| Influence | Philosophy Absorbed | Serving You? | Action |

## The Examination Process

### Step 1: Surface the Belief

**Bring it to consciousness:**
- What do you believe about X?
- State it explicitly
- Write it down
- See it clearly

### Step 2: Find the Source

**Where did it come from?**
- Family?
- Culture?
- Experience?
- Education?
- Mentors?

**Understanding source demystifies the belief.**

### Step 3: Test Validity

**Is it true? Is it useful?**
- Does evidence support it?
- Does it serve your goals?
- Is it accurate or outdated?
- Does it help or hinder?

### Step 4: Decide Consciously

**Keep, modify, or replace:**
- If valid and useful: keep consciously
- If partially valid: modify
- If invalid or harmful: replace
- Make it a chosen philosophy

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Family Philosophy Excavation

Excavate family philosophy:
1. What did your parents believe about money?
2. What did they believe about work?
3. What did they believe about success?
4. Which of these beliefs do you still hold?
5. Are they serving you?

### Exercise 2: Experience Reconstruction

Examine experience-based beliefs:
1. Identify a strong belief
2. Trace it to the experience that created it
3. Ask: Was my interpretation accurate?
4. Ask: Does generalization apply now?
5. Revise if needed

### Exercise 3: The Chosen Philosophy

Create a chosen philosophy:
1. Pick one area where inherited philosophy isn't working
2. State the current belief and its source
3. Design a new, chosen belief
4. Write it down
5. Begin operating from it

---

## Reflection Questions

1. What inherited beliefs are you operating on without examination?

2. From whom did you inherit your philosophy about money, work, and success?

3. What experiences shaped your beliefs about what's possible for you?

4. What cultural assumptions have you absorbed without questioning?

5. If you could choose your philosophy consciously, what would you choose?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Things that I felt absolutely sure of a few years ago, I don't believe anymore. This thought keeps me open to new information."

This is the growth mindset applied to philosophy. What you believed then isn't what you must believe now. What was true in one context isn't true in all contexts. Philosophy can evolve. It must evolve. Stay open. Keep examining. Keep choosing.
