**Week 38 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Mahatma Gandhi**

> "Live simply so that others may simply live."

## The Core Insight

Gandhi's practice of simple living was not asceticism for its own sake but a deliberate choice to align life with values. For leaders, personal simplicity creates credibility, clarity, and capacity. How you live shapes how you lead. The complexity or simplicity of your personal life affects your professional effectiveness and the message you send to those you lead.

Personal simplicity enables professional effectiveness.

## The Quality Focus

### Gandhi's Principle

**His teaching:**
- Quality over quantity
- Depth over breadth
- Meaning over more
- Purpose over possession

**Applied to leaders:**
- Fewer things, better
- Fewer activities, deeper
- Fewer relationships, richer
- Fewer commitments, fuller

### The Quality Test

**For possessions:**
- Is this excellent?
- Does it serve well?
- Would I buy it again?
- Does it add value?

**For activities:**
- Is this meaningful?
- Does it align with purpose?
- Would I choose it again?
- Does it add to life?

**For relationships:**
- Is this mutual?
- Does it nourish?
- Would I invest again?
- Does it add to life?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "It is the quality of our work which will please God and not the quantity."

This is Gandhi's teaching on the quality-over-quantity principle. It applies to work, but also to life. It is not how much you have but how good it is. Not how many activities but how meaningful they are. Not how many possessions but how much they serve. Not how many relationships but how deep they are. The leader who focuses on quality naturally simplifies—because quality requires focus, and focus requires elimination of the unnecessary. Pursuing quality leads to simplicity. And simplicity, Gandhi suggests, is what pleases God—and what produces excellence.
