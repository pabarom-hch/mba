# Day 3: Simple, Not Easy

**Week 29 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "What is easy to do is also easy not to do."

---

## The Core Insight

The disciplines that create success are almost always simple. Reading is simple. Exercising is simple. Reflecting is simple. Connecting is simple. But simple doesn't mean easy—and what's easy to do is also easy not to do. Rohn taught that the simplicity of success is both its accessibility and its trap: because it's easy to do, it's easy to skip.

Simple is available to everyone. That's why most people don't do it.

## The Simplicity Paradox

### Why Disciplines Are Simple

**They require no special knowledge:**
- Reading: Pick up book, read
- Exercise: Move body, regularly
- Planning: Write down priorities
- Reflection: Sit, think, write

**They require no rare resources:**
- Time is available (even 15-30 minutes)
- Books are everywhere
- Exercise requires no equipment
- Thinking is free

### Why Simple Is a Problem

**If it were hard, we'd take it seriously:**
- Complex things demand attention
- Difficult things require commitment
- Rare things are valued
- Simple things are dismissed

**Because it's simple, we devalue it:**
- "Anyone can do that"
- "It can't be that important"
- "I'll get to it later"
- "How could something so basic matter?"

## Easy to Do, Easy Not to Do

### The "Easy To Do" Side

**What makes disciplines easy:**
- No complexity to master
- No permission needed
- No resources required
- Available right now

**The opportunity:**
- You can start immediately
- No barriers to entry
- No prerequisites
- Just begin

### The "Easy Not To Do" Side

**What makes skipping easy:**
- No immediate consequence
- No one is watching
- Tomorrow seems just as good
- Comfort is more pleasant

**The trap:**
- Skipping feels fine today
- One day doesn't matter (seems)
- Comfort is appealing
- Results are invisible short-term

---

## The Visibility Problem

### Short-Term Invisibility

**What you can't see today:**
- The effect of one day's reading
- The impact of one workout
- The value of one reflection
- The power of one connection

**What this creates:**
- Sense that it doesn't matter
- "Missing once won't hurt"
- No felt consequence
- Easy justification

### Long-Term Visibility

**What becomes visible over time:**
- 10 years of daily reading = obvious wisdom
- 10 years of daily exercise = obvious health
- 10 years of daily reflection = obvious self-knowledge
- 10 years of daily connection = obvious network

**The delayed revelation:**
- Success was built invisibly
- Each day mattered
- Simple compounded
- The system worked

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Simple Neglect

An entrepreneur who dismissed simple disciplines:

**Their reasoning:**
- "Reading? Anyone can do that"
- "Exercise? I'll get to it"
- "Journaling? That's for beginners"
- Focused on "sophisticated" strategies

**What happened:**
- 10 years of dismissing simple
- Complex strategies came and went
- Fundamentals never done
- Competitors who did basics excelled

**The result:**
- Burned out from complexity
- No deep knowledge base
- Health declining
- Network thin

**The lesson:**
- Simple wasn't beneath them
- Simple was the answer
- Easy to do meant easy not to do
- Dismissal was the error

### Case 2: The Simple Commitment

A CEO who committed to simple:

**Their approach:**
- "Reading is simple—I'll do it daily"
- "Exercise is simple—I'll do it daily"
- "Reflection is simple—I'll do it daily"
- Protected time for basics

**What happened:**
- 15 years of simple disciplines
- Basics became foundation
- Compound effect accumulated
- Simple produced extraordinary

**The result:**
- Deep, broad knowledge
- Excellent health
- Profound self-awareness
- Rich network

**The lesson:**
- Simple was the strategy
- Easy to do, so they did it
- Daily commitment mattered
- Basics created excellence

### Case 3: The Simplicity Breakthrough

A leader who discovered simplicity:

**Their history:**
- Tried every complex system
- Always seeking "better" methods
- Frustrated by lack of progress
- Exhausted by complexity

**The discovery:**
- Mentor asked: "Do you read daily?"
- Answer: "No, I've been doing X system"
- Mentor: "Try simple for 90 days"
- Committed to basics only

**The result:**
- More progress in 90 days than 5 years
- Simple outperformed complex
- Energy freed from complexity
- Sustainability achieved

**The lesson:**
- Simple works better
- Complex often avoids simple
- "Easy to do" is the opportunity
- Stop seeking complicated

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Simple Discipline Inventory

**Inventory the simple disciplines:**

| Simple Discipline | Am I Doing It? | Why Not (If No) | Commit? |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Daily reading (30 min) | Y/N | | Y/N |
| Daily exercise (30 min) | Y/N | | Y/N |
| Daily reflection (15 min) | Y/N | | Y/N |
| Daily planning (15 min) | Y/N | | Y/N |
| Daily connection (1 touch) | Y/N | | Y/N |

### Application 2: Complexity Audit

**Audit complexity vs. simplicity:**

| Complex Thing I've Tried | Time/Energy Spent | Result | Simple Alternative |
|-------------------------|------------------|--------|-------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 3: "Easy Not To Do" Analysis

**Analyze why you skip simple:**

| Simple Discipline | Why Easy Not To Do | How to Make It Happen |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Application 4: Simplicity Commitment

**Commit to simple:**

| Discipline | How Simple Is It? | My Commitment | Start Date |
|------------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| | Very simple | Daily for 90 days | |
| | Very simple | | |
| | Very simple | | |

## Making Simple Happen

### Acknowledge Simplicity

**Accept that simple works:**
- Stop seeking complexity
- Stop dismissing basics
- Embrace the fundamentals
- Trust the compound effect

### Protect Simple

**Guard the time:**
- Schedule it explicitly
- Protect it from intrusion
- Treat it as non-negotiable
- Don't negotiate with yourself

### Systemize Simple

**Remove decision fatigue:**
- Same time every day
- Same place
- Same routine
- Automatic execution

### Track Simple

**Make it visible:**
- Track every day
- Celebrate streaks
- Feel the compound
- See the pattern

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Simple Commitment

Commit to simple for 30 days:
1. Choose one simple discipline
2. Commit publicly
3. Track every day
4. No exceptions for 30 days
5. Evaluate at end

### Exercise 2: The Complexity Purge

Purge unnecessary complexity:
1. List all the "systems" you've tried
2. Rate each by result (1-10)
3. Compare to simple basics
4. Stop the complexity
5. Return to simple

### Exercise 3: The Easy Not To Do Prevention

Prevent the skip:
1. Choose a simple discipline
2. Identify why it's easy not to do
3. Create a barrier to skipping
4. Create a reward for doing
5. Test for 2 weeks

## Reflection Questions

1. What simple discipline have you been dismissing as "too basic"?

2. Why do you find it easy not to do what's easy to do?

3. What complex approaches have you tried instead of simple basics?

4. What would happen if you committed to simple for 1 year?

5. How can you make simple non-negotiable?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "What is easy to do is also easy not to do."

This is the simplicity trap revealed. The very thing that makes success accessible—its simplicity—is what makes it avoidable. Reading is easy to do, so it's easy to skip. Exercise is easy to do, so it's easy to skip. The simplicity cuts both ways. Success goes to those who do the easy thing consistently. Failure goes to those who consistently don't. Same simplicity, opposite choice.

## Tomorrow's Preview

**Day 4** explores **The Compound Effect**—how simple daily disciplines multiply over time to produce extraordinary results.
