# Day 4: The Pull of Goals

**Week 32 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it."

## The Core Insight

The best goals pull you toward them. They're so compelling that you run toward them rather than pushing yourself with willpower. Rohn taught that if a goal doesn't excite you, it's either the wrong goal or it needs to be reframed. Goals should create pull, not require push.

Be pulled by goals, not pushed toward them.

## Pull vs. Push

### Push Motivation

**What it is:**
- Forcing yourself to act
- Willpower-dependent
- "I have to" energy
- Effort against resistance

**The problem:**
- Willpower depletes
- Resistance grows
- Sustainability is low
- The goal feels like burden

### Pull Motivation

**What it is:**
- Being drawn toward the goal
- Desire-dependent
- "I want to" energy
- Effort with enthusiasm

**The advantage:**
- Desire renews
- Momentum builds
- Sustainability is high
- The goal feels like adventure

## What Creates Pull

### Compelling Vision

**Pull comes from:**
- A picture of the future that excites
- Clarity about what success looks like
- Emotional connection to the outcome
- Vivid imagination of achievement

**How to create:**
- Make the goal visual
- Feel the achievement
- Know why it matters
- Connect to deep desire

### Personal Significance

**Pull comes from:**
- Goals that matter deeply
- Connection to values
- Alignment with identity
- Purpose beyond self

**How to create:**
- Know why this goal matters
- Connect it to what you care about
- Make it about who you're becoming
- Link to larger purpose

### Right-Sized Challenge

**Pull comes from:**
- Goals that stretch but don't overwhelm
- Challenge that excites, not defeats
- Possibility that feels reachable
- Stretch that's inspiring, not demoralizing

**How to create:**
- Set goals beyond current reach but within growth reach
- Not so easy as to bore
- Not so hard as to crush
- The sweet spot of challenge

## When Goals Don't Pull

### Signs of No Pull

**You know there's no pull when:**
- You avoid thinking about the goal
- Motivation requires constant forcing
- The goal feels like obligation
- You procrastinate persistently

**What this indicates:**
- The goal may be wrong
- The goal may need reframing
- The "why" may be unclear
- Something needs to change

### Diagnosing the Problem

**Possible issues:**
- Wrong goal (not what you actually want)
- Right goal, wrong framing (language doesn't inspire)
- Unclear why (purpose not connected)
- Too overwhelming (challenge crushes rather than inspires)

**The solution:**
- Examine why there's no pull
- Determine if goal should change or framing should change
- Reconnect to the "why"
- Right-size if needed

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Push Goal

A leader with a goal that required constant push:

**The goal:**
- "Increase revenue 20%"
- Set by board expectation
- Felt like obligation
- Required constant forcing

**What happened:**
- Avoided thinking about it
- Procrastinated on key actions
- Made progress but joylessly
- Burned out in the process

**The result:**
- Goal met but exhausted
- No sense of achievement
- Dreaded next goal cycle
- Success felt like survival

**The lesson:**
- Push goals drain
- Achievement without joy is hollow
- Sustainability requires pull
- Obligation isn't motivation

### Case 2: The Pull Goal

A CEO with a goal that created pull:

**The goal:**
- "Build a company that transforms how people learn"
- Connected to deep purpose
- Excited them to think about
- Drew them forward daily

**What happened:**
- Thought about it constantly
- Enthusiasm for daily work
- Challenges felt like adventure
- Energy renewed by progress

**The result:**
- Goal exceeded
- Process was fulfilling
- Couldn't wait for more
- Success felt like purpose

**The lesson:**
- Pull goals energize
- Achievement with purpose is satisfying
- Sustainability is natural
- Passion is motivation

### Case 3: The Reframed Goal

A leader who reframed a push into a pull:

**Before:**
- "Hit $X revenue" (push)
- Felt like obligation
- No emotional connection
- Required constant forcing

**The reframe:**
- "Transform X customers' businesses so profoundly they become advocates"
- Connected to purpose
- Emotionally compelling
- Same metric, different meaning

**After:**
- Same goal, different feel
- Pull emerged
- Enthusiasm returned
- Work became meaningful

**The lesson:**
- Framing matters enormously
- The same goal can push or pull
- Find the purpose behind the metric
- Reframe when necessary

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Pull Assessment

**Rate each goal on pull:**

| Goal | Pull Rating (1-10) | If Low, Why? | Reframe Needed? |
|------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| | | | Y/N |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 2: Pull Diagnosis

**For goals with low pull:**

| Goal | Wrong Goal? | Needs Reframe? | Why Unclear? | Too Overwhelming? |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N |
| | | | | |

### Application 3: Pull Enhancement

**Enhance pull for key goals:**

| Goal | Why It Really Matters | How It Connects to Purpose | Compelling Vision |
|------|----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 4: Reframing Practice

**Reframe push goals as pull:**

| Current Framing (Push) | New Framing (Pull) | How It Changes the Feel |
|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

## Creating Pull

### Connect to Deep Why

**Ask:**
- Why do I really want this?
- What does achieving this enable?
- Who am I becoming in the process?
- What's the purpose beyond the metric?

### Make It Vivid

**Practice:**
- Visualize achievement in detail
- Feel what it will be like
- See the impact on others
- Experience it before it happens

### Right-Size the Challenge

**Adjust:**
- Big enough to inspire
- Not so big as to overwhelm
- Stretch that excites
- Challenge that energizes

### Choose Compelling Words

**Frame:**
- Use language that inspires
- Describe what you want, not what you don't
- Make it positive and active
- Words that create pull

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Pull Test

Test pull for each goal:
1. Think about your top 3 goals
2. Rate each on excitement (1-10)
3. For any below 7, ask why
4. Determine: reframe or replace
5. Create pull for each

### Exercise 2: The Why Deep Dive

Find the deep why:
1. Take your most important goal
2. Ask "why" five times
3. Get to the root motivation
4. Use that root to create pull
5. Reframe goal around the deep why

### Exercise 3: The Vision Experience

Experience achievement:
1. Close eyes and imagine achieving the goal
2. What does it look like?
3. How does it feel?
4. Who is impacted?
5. Use this vision to create pull

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Which of your goals truly pull you, and which require push?

2. For goals that don't pull, what's the root problem?

3. What's the deep "why" behind your most important goal?

4. How could you reframe obligation goals as purpose goals?

5. What would change if all your goals pulled you?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it."

This connects back to transformation—and transformation is pull. When you see that the goal is about who you become, not just what you get, pull emerges naturally. You're pulled toward becoming that person. The goal becomes a vehicle for growth, and growth is inherently attractive. Find the transformation in the goal, and you'll find the pull.
