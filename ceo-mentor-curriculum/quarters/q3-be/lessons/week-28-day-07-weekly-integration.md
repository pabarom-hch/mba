## Key Quote for the Week

> "Life and business are like the seasons. You cannot change the seasons, but you can change yourself."

This is the complete seasonal wisdom. Life moves in seasons—winter, spring, summer, fall—and you can't stop them. They come when they come. But you are not helpless. You can change yourself. Your preparation, your response, your strategy, your mindset. The same season that destroys one person strengthens another. The difference is not the season. The difference is the person.

---

## The Seasonal Check

**Before moving on, verify:**

□ I can identify my current season
□ I have a season-appropriate strategy
□ I've stopped fighting what I can't change
□ I'm focused on changing myself
□ I'm prepared (or preparing) for the next season
□ I understand each season's purpose and strategy
□ I'm accepting seasons rather than complaining about them

If any box is unchecked, address it before proceeding.
