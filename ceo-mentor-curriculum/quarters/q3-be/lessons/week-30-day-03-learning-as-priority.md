# Day 3: Learning as Priority

**Week 30 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune."

## The Core Insight

Formal education ends. Self-education is forever. Rohn distinguished between these two types of learning: formal education gives you the foundation to make a living, but self-education—the continuous, self-directed learning you pursue after school—is what creates fortunes. The self-educated leader is the one who keeps growing.

Never stop learning.

## Formal vs. Self-Education

### Formal Education

**What it provides:**
- Foundation of knowledge
- Basic frameworks
- Credentials
- Entry to fields

**Its limitations:**
- It ends
- It's general
- It becomes outdated
- It's not customized

### Self-Education

**What it provides:**
- Continuous development
- Specific, relevant knowledge
- Current understanding
- Tailored to your needs

**Its advantages:**
- It never ends
- It's directed by you
- It evolves with the world
- It addresses your gaps

## Why Self-Education Makes Fortunes

### The Continuous Advantage

**Self-educators vs. non-learners:**
- Self-educators keep growing
- Knowledge compounds
- Advantage increases
- Gap widens over time

**The fortune mechanism:**
- Better knowledge → Better decisions
- Better decisions → Better outcomes
- Better outcomes → Greater results
- Compounded over decades = Fortune

### The Relevance Advantage

**The world changes:**
- Industries evolve
- Technologies emerge
- Markets shift
- Old knowledge becomes obsolete

**Self-educators adapt:**
- Learn the new
- Understand the changes
- Stay relevant
- Lead the change

## Making Learning a Priority

### Priority vs. Interest

**When learning is an interest:**
- "I'll learn when I have time"
- "I'll read when things slow down"
- "I'm interested in developing"
- Learning happens sporadically

**When learning is a priority:**
- Time is made for learning
- Reading happens daily
- Development is scheduled
- Learning happens consistently

### Operationalizing the Priority

**Time allocation:**
- Dedicated learning time
- Minimum daily learning
- Protected from interruption
- Non-negotiable

**Resource allocation:**
- Budget for learning
- Investment in materials
- Access to mentors
- Commitment to growth

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune."

This is Rohn's fortune formula. Formal education—school, degrees, credentials—gives you entry, a foundation, a living. But the fortune comes from self-education—what you teach yourself after school ends. Self-education is continuous, directed, relevant, and unlimited. The formally educated make a living. The self-educated make a fortune. Which are you pursuing?
