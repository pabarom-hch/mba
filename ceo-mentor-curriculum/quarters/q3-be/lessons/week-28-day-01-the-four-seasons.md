# Day 1: The Four Seasons

**Week 28 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Jim Rohn**

> "Learn how to handle the winters. They come regularly, right after fall. Some are long, some are short, some are difficult, some are easy. But they always come."

---

## The Core Insight

Life moves in seasons—spring (opportunity), summer (growth), fall (harvest), winter (challenge). This framework, which Rohn learned from his mentor Earl Shoaff, provides a lens for understanding where you are and what strategy you need. The wise person doesn't fight seasons; they work with them.

Seasons are inevitable. Strategy must match the season.

## The Season Cycle

### The Inevitable Progression

**How seasons move:**
- Winter → Spring → Summer → Fall → Winter
- The cycle repeats indefinitely
- You can't skip seasons
- You can't extend seasons forever

**The pattern:**
- After every fall comes winter
- After every winter comes spring
- Nothing stays the same
- Change is the only constant

### The Seasons Don't Ask Permission

**What you cannot control:**
- When seasons change
- How long they last
- That they will come
- That they will end

**What you can control:**
- Your response
- Your preparation
- Your strategy
- Your mindset

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Unprepared CEO

A CEO caught by seasonal change:

**Their situation:**
- Long period of growth (summer)
- Assumed it would continue
- Built no reserves
- Ignored warning signs

**When winter came:**
- Market contracted unexpectedly
- Resources were stretched thin
- No cushion existed
- Crisis mode ensued

**The outcome:**
- Near-bankruptcy
- Desperate measures
- Painful cuts
- Years to recover

**The lesson:**
- Seasons always change
- Summer doesn't last forever
- Preparation must happen during abundance
- Assuming continuation is dangerous

### Case 2: The Seasonal Master

A CEO who understood seasons:

**Their approach:**
- Always knew current season
- Built reserves in summer/fall
- Planted heavily in spring
- Used winter for learning

**How they navigated:**
- In summer: protected and grew carefully
- In fall: harvested fully without apology
- In winter: learned, prepared, conserved
- In spring: moved fast on opportunities

**The outcome:**
- Weathered multiple cycles
- Grew through adversity
- Never caught off-guard
- Compound success over decades

**The lesson:**
- Seasonal awareness creates advantage
- Appropriate strategy for each season
- Long-term view smooths cycles
- Preparation is ongoing

### Case 3: The Season Shifter

A CEO who found opportunity in winter:

**Their insight:**
- Winter for some is spring for others
- Economic downturns create opportunity
- What dies in winter can be acquired
- Strategy can shift perception of season

**Their action:**
- When competitors struggled (their winter)
- CEO saw opportunity (their spring)
- Made strategic acquisitions
- Invested when prices were low

**The outcome:**
- Emerged from downturn stronger
- Acquired valuable assets cheaply
- Positioned for rapid growth
- Turned crisis into opportunity

**The lesson:**
- Seasons are relative
- Difficulty for some creates opportunity for others
- Strategy can reframe the season
- What season you're in depends on perspective

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Learn how to handle the winters. They come regularly, right after fall. Some are long, some are short, some are difficult, some are easy. But they always come."

This is the foundational seasons teaching. Winters come. Not "might come"—come. They arrive regularly, as part of the cycle. The question isn't whether winter will come, but whether you'll be ready. Handle winters—don't just survive them, but handle them well. Learn from them. Use them. They're part of the rhythm.
