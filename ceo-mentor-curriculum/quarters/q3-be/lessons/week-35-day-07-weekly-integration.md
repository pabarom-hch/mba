## Key Quote for the Week

> "Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction."

This is Gandhi's bold claim for ahimsa. Not a compromise, not a weakness, not a second-best option—the greatest force. Mightier than weapons of destruction. This runs counter to most assumptions about power. But Gandhi proved it: non-violent resistance brought down an empire. In leadership, non-violence builds what destruction cannot: trust, sustainability, authentic achievement. The greatest force is not the one that destroys most, but the one that builds most while harming least.
