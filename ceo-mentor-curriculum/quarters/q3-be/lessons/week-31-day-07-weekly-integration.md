| Day | Topic | Core Concept |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| 1 | The Five People | You average toward your five closest associations |

| 3 | The Disassociation Challenge | Reducing limiting associations is hard but necessary |
| 4 | Seeking Expanders | Find and cultivate relationships with those ahead |
| 5 | Your Contribution | You're in someone's five—be an expander |
| 6 | Deliberate Association Design | Design rather than accept associations |

## The Complete Association Framework

### The Foundation: The Five People Principle

**Key realizations:**
- You become the average of your five closest associations
- This isn't metaphor—it's mathematics
- Income, ambition, values, standards all average
- Environment shapes identity more than willpower

### The Categories: Expanders, Maintainers, Limiters

**The classification:**
- Expanders raise your standards and challenge you
- Maintainers keep you the same
- Limiters lower your expectations and contain you

**The math:**
- More time with expanders = upward trajectory
- More time with limiters = downward trajectory
- The ratio determines the direction

### The Challenge: Disassociation

**The reality:**
- Some associations must be reduced or eliminated
- This is hard—history, emotion, social cost
- But the cost of keeping is higher
- Disassociation creates space for expansion

### The Opportunity: Seeking Expanders

**The strategy:**
- Deliberately seek people ahead of you
- Find them in premium environments
- Offer value to attract them
- Invest in these relationships

### The Responsibility: Your Contribution

**The truth:**
- You're in someone else's five
- You shape those around you
- Be an expander for others
- Your influence matters

### The Design: Deliberate Association

**The approach:**
- Don't leave associations to accident
- Design your association portfolio
- Create the environment that shapes you
- Take control of this critical variable

## The Rohn Legacy for Associations

### His Core Teaching

**Environment beats willpower:**

- Sought mentors (Earl Shoaff)

- Reduced limiting associations
- Taught others to do the same

### His Challenge

**What he would ask:**

- Are they where you want to be?
- Are you where they'll take you?
- What changes must you make?

## Key Quote for the Week

> "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with."

This is Rohn's signature insight. It's not vague influence—it's an average. You are mathematically moving toward the mean of your five. Their income, their ambition, their values, their expectations—you're averaging toward them. This is the most actionable principle for self-transformation: change your five, change yourself. The associations you choose are the future you create.

## The Association Check

**Before moving on, verify:**

□ I can identify my current five people
□ I've categorized my associations as expanders/maintainers/limiters
□ I've identified limiting associations that need to be addressed
□ I've identified expanders I need to seek
□ I've assessed my contribution to others
□ I have a plan for deliberate association design
□ I understand that environment shapes destiny

If any box is unchecked, address it before proceeding.
