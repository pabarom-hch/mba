# Day 5: Going First

**Week 33 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Mahatma Gandhi**

> "In a gentle way, you can shake the world."

## The Core Insight

Gandhi went first into danger. First into discomfort. First into sacrifice. He never asked of his followers what he hadn't already done himself. This is the ultimate expression of leading by example: you go first. Before you ask others to change, you change. Before you expect sacrifice, you sacrifice. Before you demand courage, you demonstrate it.

Leaders go first.

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The CEO Who Wouldn't Go First

A leader who asked without modeling:

**The situation:**
- Needed organization to change
- Asked for new behaviors
- Demanded sacrifice
- Required adaptation

**The problem:**
- Didn't change own behavior
- Didn't sacrifice personally
- Exempted self from demands
- "Do as I say, not as I do"

**The result:**
- Change failed
- Resentment built
- Credibility destroyed
- "Why should we when they don't?"

**The lesson:**
- Can't ask what you won't do
- Exemption kills credibility
- Going first is required
- Asking without modeling fails

### Case 2: The Going-First CEO

A leader who went first into difficulty:

**The situation:**
- Company crisis required sacrifice
- Salaries needed to be cut
- Everyone needed to give

**What they did:**
- Cut own salary first, most, publicly
- Gave up perks visibly
- Made personal sacrifices clear
- Then asked others to sacrifice

**The result:**
- Team followed willingly
- Resentment minimized
- Solidarity emerged
- Crisis weathered together

**The lesson:**
- Going first creates followership
- Personal sacrifice earns right to ask
- Visible modeling opens doors
- "Come" is more powerful than "go"

### Case 3: The Transformation Leader

A leader who modeled change personally:

**The context:**
- Needed cultural transformation
- Old behaviors had to go
- New ways had to be adopted
- Entire organization had to shift

**Their approach:**
- Changed own behavior first
- Visibly adopted new ways
- Admitted own needed changes
- Let team see personal transformation

**The specifics:**
- Wanted more transparency—started sharing more
- Wanted more accountability—started owning mistakes first
- Wanted more innovation—started taking risks first
- Wanted more collaboration—started asking for help first

**The result:**
- Team saw possibility
- Modeling made it real
- Transformation spread
- Change happened

**The lesson:**
- Transformation starts with you
- Visible personal change enables organizational change
- Going first proves it's possible
- Others follow what they see

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Going First Audit

**Audit where you need to go first:**

|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| | Y/N | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Application 2: First Into Difficulty

**Identify difficult things to model:**

| Difficult Thing Needed | Am I Doing It? | How to Go First |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Hard conversation | Y/N | |
| Personal change | | |
| Sacrifice | | |
| Risk | | |

### Application 3: Sacrifice Modeling

**Plan visible sacrifice:**

| Sacrifice to Make | When | How to Make Visible | Who Needs to See |
|-------------------|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 4: "Come" vs. "Go"

**Convert "go" to "come":**

|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| | | |
| | | |

## The Gentle Shaking

### Power Through Modeling

**Gandhi's insight:**
- You don't need to force
- Gentle example is powerful
- Modeling creates pull
- Going first opens paths

**The mechanism:**
- When you go first, resistance drops
- What seemed impossible becomes possible
- "If they can, I can"
- Gentle but powerful change

### Sustainable Change

**The difference:**
- Forced change creates resistance
- Modeled change creates adoption
- "Go" breeds resentment
- "Come" builds community

**The result:**
- Change that lasts
- Change that spreads
- Change that's owned
- Change that multiplies

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The "Come" Conversion

Convert demands to modeling:
1. List 3 things you're asking of your organization
2. For each: Have you gone first?
3. If not: What would going first look like?
4. Plan specific actions to go first
5. Go first, then ask

### Exercise 2: The First Sacrifice

Make the first sacrifice:
1. Identify something the organization needs to give up
2. What's your equivalent to give up first?
3. Make it visible
4. Then ask others to sacrifice

### Exercise 3: The Vulnerability Lead

Lead with vulnerability:
1. Identify where you're asking openness
2. Be open first—share a failure, uncertainty, or need
3. Do it publicly, appropriately
4. Note how it opens space for others
5. Observe the ripple effect

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Where are you asking others to go somewhere you haven't gone first?

2. What sacrifice are you asking that you haven't made yourself?

3. What would change if you always said "come" instead of "go"?

4. Where do you need to go first into difficulty, discomfort, or danger?

5. What gentle but powerful change could you create by going first?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "In a gentle way, you can shake the world."

This is Gandhi's paradox of power. You don't need to force or demand. You can shake the world—transform it fundamentally—through gentle, persistent example. Going first is gentle: you're not pushing, you're leading. You're not demanding, you're demonstrating. You're not coercing, you're inviting. And this gentle approach can move mountains. When you go first into difficulty, sacrifice, and change, you create a path others can follow. That's not weakness—that's the most powerful form of leadership there is.
