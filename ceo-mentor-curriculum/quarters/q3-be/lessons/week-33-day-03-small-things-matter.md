# Day 3: Small Things Matter

**Week 33 | Q3 — BE | Mentor: Mahatma Gandhi**

> "It is the quality of our work which will please God and not the quantity."

## The Core Insight

Gandhi famously cleaned latrines—the most humble, disdained work—to demonstrate that no work was beneath anyone. The small things reveal character. Details matter. The things you do when you think no one is watching, the tasks you consider beneath you, the small interactions you dismiss—these are where your true character is visible.

Small things are big things in disguise.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "It is the quality of our work which will please God and not the quantity."

This is Gandhi's teaching on attention to detail. It's not about how much you do, but how well you do what you do—including the smallest things. Quality in small tasks reveals character. Carelessness in minor matters predicts carelessness in major ones. Give quality attention to small things: the brief interaction, the minor task, the "insignificant" detail. These aren't distractions from important work—they ARE important work. The quality of your small things is the quality of your character made visible.
