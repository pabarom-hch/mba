# Week 33: Be the Change

**Quarter:** Q3 — BE
**Mentor:** Mahatma Gandhi
**Theme:** Leading by example

> "Be the change you wish to see in the world." — Gandhi

---

## Overview

Gandhi's most famous teaching: transformation begins with self. You cannot ask of others what you do not embody. Leadership credibility comes from example, not exhortation.

This week examines the gap between what you ask and what you model—and closes it.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — The Credibility of Example
**Morning Meditation:**
> "An ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What do you ask of your team that you don't fully model? Where is there a gap between your expectations and your example?

**CEO Application:**
List three things you want from your organization. For each: Do you model it perfectly? If not, what's the gap?

### Day 2 — The Gap
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Action expresses priorities."

**Reflection Prompt:**
People watch what you do, not what you say. What do your actions tell them about your real priorities?

**CEO Application:**
Ask someone you trust: "What do my actions say about my priorities?" Listen without defending.

### Day 3 — Small Things Matter
**Morning Meditation:**
> "It is the quality of our work which will please God and not the quantity."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Gandhi cleaned latrines to demonstrate that no work was beneath anyone. What "small things" do you model or avoid?

**CEO Application:**
This week, do something you would normally ask others to do. Something visible. Something that demonstrates "nothing is beneath me."

### Day 4 — Consistency
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Are you the same person in all contexts? Or do you adjust your behavior based on audience? What does inconsistency cost?

**CEO Application:**
Identify where you're inconsistent between what you say and do, or between different contexts. What would consistency require?

### Day 5 — Going First
**Morning Meditation:**
> "In a gentle way, you can shake the world."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Gandhi went first into danger, first into discomfort, first into sacrifice. Where do you need to go first?

**CEO Application:**
What difficult thing do you need to model before asking others? A difficult conversation? A sacrifice? A change?

### Day 6 — The Ripple Effect
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."

**Reflection Prompt:**
When you change, others notice and may change too. What change in yourself would have the greatest ripple effect?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one change in yourself that would most positively impact your organization. Commit to it.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"My life is my message."* — Gandhi

The CEO's behavior is the organization's culture. What you model spreads; what you tolerate multiplies. Your team watches you constantly—how you handle stress, how you treat people, what you sacrifice for, what you compromise on.

Close the gap between what you ask and what you model. Go first. Be consistent. Let your life be your message.
