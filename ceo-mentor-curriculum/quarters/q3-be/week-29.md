# Week 29: Daily Disciplines

**Quarter:** Q3 — BE
**Mentor:** Jim Rohn
**Theme:** Success is daily, not a single event

> "Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines practiced every day." — Jim Rohn

---

## Overview

Rohn's most practical teaching: success is not a one-time achievement but the compound effect of daily disciplines. What you do every day matters more than what you do occasionally. Small actions, consistently taken, produce massive results over time.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — The Power of Daily
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines practiced every day; failure is a few errors in judgment repeated every day."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What do you do every single day? Not occasionally, not when you remember—every day. What's the compound effect of these actions?

**CEO Application:**
List your current daily disciplines. Are they the ones that will compound into the success you want?

### Day 2 — Discipline vs. Regret
**Morning Meditation:**
> "We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Where have you chosen short-term comfort over discipline? What regret has accumulated?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one discipline you've been avoiding. What's the pain of doing it? What's the pain of not doing it over 10 years?

### Day 3 — Simple, Not Easy
**Morning Meditation:**
> "What is easy to do is also easy not to do."

**Reflection Prompt:**
The disciplines that create success are usually simple. Reading, exercising, reflecting, connecting. Why do simple things go undone?

**CEO Application:**
Choose one simple discipline you know would help. Why haven't you been doing it? What would make it non-negotiable?

### Day 4 — The Compound Effect
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The few things that work need to be repeated every day."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Small disciplines compound over time. What would happen if you read 30 minutes daily for 10 years? Exercised daily? Reflected daily?

**CEO Application:**
Calculate the compound effect of one discipline practiced daily for 5 years. Is it worth 15-30 minutes per day?

### Day 5 — Non-Negotiables
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Either you run the day, or the day runs you."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Which disciplines are truly non-negotiable for you? What would have to happen for you to skip them?

**CEO Application:**
Define 3-5 non-negotiable daily disciplines. What makes something non-negotiable? How do you protect them?

### Day 6 — Building the Habit
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How do you turn disciplines into habits? What's made past habit changes stick or fail?

**CEO Application:**
For a discipline you want to establish, design the habit loop: cue, routine, reward. When will you start?

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment."* — Jim Rohn

The CEO's daily disciplines shape the organization more than any strategy document. Your energy, your focus, your growth—these radiate through everything you do.

Design your daily disciplines deliberately. Protect them fiercely. The compound effect of consistent daily action over years is how extraordinary outcomes emerge from ordinary people.
