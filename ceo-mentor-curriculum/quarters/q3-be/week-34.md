# Week 34: Truth (Satya)

**Quarter:** Q3 — BE
**Mentor:** Mahatma Gandhi
**Theme:** The power of radical honesty

> "Truth never damages a cause that is just." — Gandhi

## Overview

Gandhi called his autobiography "My Experiments with Truth." Truth (Satya) was his highest principle—he believed that alignment with truth created unstoppable moral force. Untruth, even in small things, weakened everything.

This week examines radical honesty as a leadership practice.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Truth as Foundation
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Truth is God, and God is Truth."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How truthful are you in your daily interactions? Not just avoiding lies, but speaking full truth?

**CEO Application:**
Today, notice every moment you shade the truth—through omission, spin, or deflection. Don't judge; just notice.

---

### Day 2 — The Cost of Untruth
**Morning Meditation:**
> "An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What has untruth—yours or others'—cost you in your career? What's the hidden cost of even small untruths?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one situation where untruth created downstream problems. What would truth have cost upfront? What did untruth cost eventually?

---

### Day 3 — Truth to Self
**Morning Meditation:**
> "As long as you derive inner help and comfort from anything, keep it."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Are you honest with yourself? About your strengths and weaknesses? About your motivations? About your fears?

**CEO Application:**
Write down a truth about yourself that you often avoid acknowledging. Sit with it.

---

### Day 4 — Truth to Others
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The moment there is suspicion about a person's motives, everything he does becomes tainted."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How does radical honesty with others affect relationships? Does it damage or strengthen them in the long run?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one truth you've been withholding from someone important. Consider what speaking it would require.

---

### Day 5 — Creating Truth-Telling Culture
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Silence becomes cowardice when occasion demands speaking out the whole truth."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Is truth-telling safe in your organization? Do people tell you uncomfortable truths, or do they filter?

**CEO Application:**
Ask someone: "What truth is our organization avoiding right now?" Listen without defending.

---

### Day 6 — Truth and Courage
**Morning Meditation:**
> "A 'No' uttered from the deepest conviction is better than a 'Yes' merely uttered to please, or worse, to avoid trouble."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Truth-telling requires courage. When is truth most difficult for you? What fears drive avoidance?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one truth that requires courage to speak. Prepare to speak it.

3. **Truth requires courage.** The easy path is usually the untruthful path.

4. **Truth-telling culture must be built.** It doesn't happen naturally; it must be made safe.

5. **Short-term pain, long-term gain.** Truth costs upfront but saves enormously downstream.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"The pursuit of truth does not permit violence on one's opponent."* — Gandhi

The CEO who embraces truth has a superpower. They're not managing multiple versions of reality. They're not remembering what they told whom. They're not waiting for untruths to surface.

Build a culture where truth flows freely—up, down, and across. Where bad news travels fast. Where reality is discussed, not spun. This requires making truth-telling safe, rewarding honesty, and modeling it yourself.
