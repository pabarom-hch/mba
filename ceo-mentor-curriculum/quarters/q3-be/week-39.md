5. **Truth creates power.** Radical honesty is a competitive advantage.

6. **Service is leadership.** Leaders serve; they're not served.

## Transition to Q4: LEAD

Q1 taught you to think. Q2 taught you to build. Q3 taught you to be.

Q4 teaches you to lead.

With Nelson Mandela and John Maxwell, you'll examine leadership through adversity, resilient leadership, and the practical laws of influence. The character developed in Q3 becomes the foundation for the leadership of Q4.

## Mentor's Final Words

**Jim Rohn:**
*"Work harder on yourself than you do on your job. If you work hard on your job, you'll make a living. If you work hard on yourself, you can make a fortune."*

**Gandhi:**
*"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."*

You've spent Q3 turning inward—developing the personal mastery and character that leadership requires. Now you turn outward to lead.

The leader's inner life shapes the outer organization. What you've built inside now becomes the foundation for what you'll lead outside.
