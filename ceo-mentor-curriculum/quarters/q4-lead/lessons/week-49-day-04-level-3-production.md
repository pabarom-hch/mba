# Week 49, Day 4: Level 3 - Production

> "The bottom line in leadership isn't how far we advance ourselves but how far we advance others." — John C. Maxwell

## The Core Insight

Level 3 separates leaders from people who simply have good relationships. At this level, people follow because of what the leader has accomplished for the organization. Results create credibility that relationship alone cannot provide. While Level 2 earns permission to lead, Level 3 proves that following this leader leads somewhere meaningful.

Maxwell emphasizes that Level 3 is where leadership becomes tangible. Vision becomes reality. Plans become outcomes. Intentions become impact. Leaders who achieve Level 3 have demonstrated that they can actually deliver — and this demonstration creates a credibility that significantly amplifies their influence.

## The Nature of Production-Based Leadership

### What Production Provides

Consistent results create unique leadership advantages:

**Credibility**: Results prove capability. When a leader delivers outcomes, followers have evidence that this person knows what they're doing. This credibility supports future initiatives because people have seen past success.

**Momentum**: Production creates organizational energy. Success builds upon success. Teams that achieve results develop confidence that enables further achievement.

**Attraction**: Productive leaders attract talent. High performers want to work with leaders who deliver results. Level 3 leadership creates a talent magnet.

**Authority to Challenge**: Results earn the right to push for more. Leaders who have delivered can credibly demand higher performance. This production-based authority exceeds positional authority.

### The Relationship Between Levels 2 and 3

Level 2 and Level 3 work together synergistically:

**Level 2 Enables Level 3**: The trust and communication from Level 2 relationships enable the collaboration needed for Level 3 production. Teams without relational connection rarely produce exceptional results.

**Level 3 Strengthens Level 2**: Results validate the relationship investment. People feel their trust was well-placed when the leader delivers. Success reinforces relational bonds.

**Both Must Be Maintained**: Leaders must continue Level 2 relationship investment while pursuing Level 3 results. Sacrificing relationship for results creates short-term gains with long-term costs.

### The Feel of Level 3

Level 3 leadership has a distinct character:

**For Followers**:
- Pride in being part of a winning team
- Confidence that following this leader leads to success
- Willingness to work hard because effort produces outcomes
- Trust in the leader's competence, not just intentions
- Attraction of outside talent wanting to join the team

**For Leaders**:
- Track record that supports bold proposals
- Ability to recruit top talent
- Credibility to push through difficult changes
- Organizational influence beyond direct reports
- Foundation for moving to Level 4 development

## Producing at Level 3

### The Production Mindset

Level 3 leaders think differently about results:

**Outcome Orientation**: Focus on meaningful outcomes rather than activities. The question is not "What did we do?" but "What did we achieve?"

**Modeling Excellence**: Leaders demonstrate production personally before expecting it from others. They produce, not just manage production.

**Removing Obstacles**: Productive leaders identify and eliminate barriers to team achievement. They take responsibility for creating conditions where results are possible.

**Accountability Culture**: Level 3 leaders create environments where accountability is embraced, not feared. Clear expectations and fair consequences support production.

### What Counts as Production

Production at Level 3 goes beyond individual achievement:

**Organizational Results**: Goals met, metrics achieved, strategies executed. The organization demonstrably moves forward under this leader's guidance.

**Team Development**: While Level 4 focuses on individual development, Level 3 includes building high-performing teams. The leader creates a productive unit, not just productive individuals.

**Problem Solving**: Challenges navigated, crises resolved, obstacles overcome. Leaders prove their worth when things get difficult.

**Value Creation**: Tangible value delivered to customers, shareholders, or stakeholders. Production must be meaningful to someone beyond the organization itself.

### Sustaining Production

One-time results don't establish Level 3 leadership. Sustainable production requires:

**Consistent Delivery**: Results must be repeatable, not lucky. Level 3 leaders deliver across time and situations.

**Scalable Approaches**: Methods must work as the organization grows. Individual heroics that don't scale create bottlenecks rather than sustainable production.

**System Development**: Level 3 leaders build systems that produce results, not just personal production capacity. These systems continue producing even when the leader's attention is elsewhere.

**Continuous Improvement**: Production standards must rise over time. Last year's excellent is this year's baseline.

## The Dangers of Level 3

### Production at the Cost of People

The most common Level 3 danger is sacrificing relationships for results:

**Warning Signs**:
- Team members feel used rather than valued
- Turnover increases despite strong results
- Communication becomes purely task-focused
- People comply but don't commit
- Results require unsustainable personal sacrifice

**The Consequence**: Short-term results come at the cost of long-term capability. Teams burn out. Talented people leave. Level 2 relationships erode. Eventually, production itself suffers.

### The Solo Producer Trap

Some leaders achieve Level 3 through personal production rather than enabling team production:

**Warning Signs**:
- Leader does most critical work personally
- Team capability remains undeveloped
- Results depend on leader's direct involvement
- Succession would be problematic
- Leader is bottleneck for organizational capacity

**The Consequence**: Organizational capacity is limited by individual leader capacity. Growth is constrained. The leader cannot move to Level 4 because they're too busy producing.

### The Results Addiction

Success can create unhealthy dependence on achievement:

**Warning Signs**:
- Identity entirely tied to results
- Inability to tolerate setbacks or failures
- Pushing for results beyond healthy limits
- Neglecting other life dimensions for production
- Valuing people only for their production contribution

**The Consequence**: Leaders lose perspective on what matters beyond results. Relationships, health, and meaning suffer. Eventual burnout is likely.

## Case Studies in Level 3 Leadership

### Case Study 1: The Relentless Producer (Negative Example)

**Background**: Victoria Chen was hired as COO specifically to drive results in a struggling company. She delivered impressive short-term improvements through aggressive cost-cutting, process optimization, and demanding accountability.

**The Approach**: Victoria focused exclusively on production:
- She set aggressive targets and held people ruthlessly accountable
- She spent little time on relationship building, viewing it as inefficient
- She made decisions based solely on metrics and results
- She replaced anyone who didn't meet production standards quickly
- She celebrated results publicly but rarely acknowledged individuals

**The Results**: In year one, Victoria dramatically improved profitability. But by year two, problems emerged:
- Talented employees left for less demanding environments
- Remaining employees were burned out and disengaged
- Innovation declined as people focused on safe, measurable activities
- Customer satisfaction dropped as corner-cutting became common
- Recruiting became difficult due to company reputation

**The Outcome**: Victoria achieved Level 3 production without maintaining Level 2 relationships. The production proved unsustainable. By year three, results had declined below where she started, and Victoria was asked to leave.

**Lessons Learned**:
- Production without relationship is unsustainable
- Short-term results can mask long-term deterioration
- Level 3 requires continued Level 2 investment
- People are the source of sustainable production

### Case Study 2: The Relational Producer (Positive Example)

**Background**: Marcus Johnson became CEO of a mid-sized technology company that had solid relationships but inconsistent results. He set out to achieve Level 3 production while maintaining and strengthening Level 2 relationships.

**The Approach**: Marcus balanced relationship and results:
- He set clear, ambitious goals while investing time in understanding each person
- He held people accountable while providing support to help them succeed
- He celebrated team achievements while recognizing individual contributions
- He addressed performance issues directly but with evident care for the person
- He modeled production personally while developing team capability

**The Results**: Over three years, Marcus transformed the organization:
- Results improved consistently year over year
- Employee engagement reached industry-leading levels
- Top talent sought positions with the company
- Customer satisfaction increased alongside financial performance
- The organization developed capacity for continued growth

**The Key Insight**: Marcus demonstrated that Level 3 production and Level 2 relationships are mutually reinforcing, not competing. His relational investment created the trust and engagement that enabled exceptional production.

**Lessons Learned**:
- Relationship and results reinforce each other when balanced
- Accountability with care produces better results than accountability alone
- Level 3 should strengthen, not strain, Level 2 relationships
- Sustainable production requires people investment

### Case Study 3: The Producer's Evolution (Transformation Example)

**Background**: Angela Rodriguez had built her reputation as a results-focused leader. Her teams always delivered, but at significant cost — turnover was high, engagement was low, and people described her as demanding and cold. Feedback from a mentor challenged her to evolve.

**The Realization**: Angela recognized that her Level 3 production came at Level 2 expense. She was achieving results but leaving damaged relationships in her wake. Her mentor challenged her: "What would it look like to produce exceptional results while also developing exceptional relationships?"

**The Transformation**: Angela committed to changing her approach:
- She began each interaction considering the person, not just the task
- She invested time in understanding what mattered to team members
- She continued expecting high performance but added support and development
- She celebrated results while also celebrating people
- She addressed her own workaholism and modeled healthier patterns

**The Results**: Angela's results remained strong while her relationships transformed. Turnover dropped dramatically. Team members began advocating to work with her. Her influence expanded beyond her direct team. She became a candidate for larger leadership roles.

**Lessons Learned**:
- Production-focused leaders can develop relational capabilities
- Results need not suffer when relationship investment increases
- The combination of production and relationship creates leadership leverage
- Self-awareness about leadership gaps is the first step to change

**Instructions**:
1. Identify a stretch production goal for the next 12 months
2. Define success metrics clearly
3. Identify relationship risks in pursuing this goal
4. Create explicit safeguards for each relationship risk:
   - What behaviors will I maintain regardless of production pressure?
   - How will I monitor relationship health during pursuit?
   - What warning signs will trigger recalibration?
5. Share the goal and safeguards with your team
6. Request their help holding you accountable to both production and relationship
7. Review monthly against both production and relationship metrics

**Deliverable**: A production goal with integrated relationship safeguards and accountability plan.

## Reflection Questions

1. **What results have most established your Level 3 credibility, and what made those achievements possible?** Identify the sources of your production credibility.

2. **Where might your pursuit of production be straining Level 2 relationships?** Honestly assess whether results are coming at relationship cost.

3. **How sustainable and scalable is your current production?** Consider whether your results depend too heavily on your personal involvement.

4. **What production gaps undermine your leadership credibility?** Identify areas where lack of results limits your influence.

5. **How could you achieve even better results through deeper relationship investment?** Consider whether more Level 2 investment might actually increase Level 3 production.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Production is the easiest way to measure leadership effectiveness. It's objective. It's measurable. It shows whether a leader is taking the organization somewhere meaningful." — John C. Maxwell

This quote acknowledges production's importance while pointing toward its proper role. Results are the evidence that leadership is working. Without production, leadership remains theoretical — nice relationships that go nowhere, good intentions without impact.

However, the quote also implies that production is a measure of leadership, not the definition of leadership. Leaders who become so focused on measurement that they neglect what produces results — namely, people — eventually see their measurements decline. Production matters because it proves leadership effectiveness; it should not become the sole purpose of leadership.

## Tomorrow's Preview

Tomorrow we explore **Level 4: People Development** — the level where leadership impact multiplies through investing in others. We will examine how developing other leaders extends influence beyond personal capacity, the mindset shift required to prioritize development, and practical strategies for becoming a leader who develops leaders. You will learn how to move from producing results to reproducing leaders.
