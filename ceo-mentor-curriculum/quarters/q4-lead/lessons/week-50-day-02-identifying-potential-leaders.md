# Week 50, Day 2: Identifying Potential Leaders

> "The key to surrounding yourself with other leaders is to find the best people you can, then develop them into the best leaders they can be." — John Maxwell

## The Core Insight

Not everyone can become a leader, and not everyone who can become a leader should receive your development investment. The scarcest resource in leadership multiplication is your time and energy. Investing this resource in people without genuine leadership potential wastes both their potential and yours. The ability to identify potential leaders—to see what they could become rather than just what they are—separates successful multipliers from well-intentioned but ineffective developers.

This identification is both art and science, requiring observation, testing, and intuition refined through experience.

## The Difference Between Followers and Leaders

### Characteristics of Natural Followers

Understanding followers helps clarify what distinguishes potential leaders:

**Comfort with Direction**: Followers prefer receiving clear instructions. They want to know exactly what to do, how to do it, and when it's due. Ambiguity creates anxiety rather than opportunity.

**Task Orientation**: Followers focus on completing assigned tasks well. Success means finishing their work correctly. They rarely look beyond their defined responsibilities.

**Risk Avoidance**: Followers prefer proven methods and established processes. Innovation feels dangerous rather than exciting. They ask "Why change what works?"

**Reactive Posture**: Followers respond to problems when instructed. They wait for assignments rather than seeking out challenges. They implement solutions others create.

**External Validation**: Followers need regular feedback and recognition to maintain motivation. They measure success by others' approval.

**Important Note**: Being a follower is not inferior to being a leader. Organizations need excellent followers. The problem is not followers but developing followers as if they were potential leaders, wasting both your time and their potential contribution.

### Characteristics of Potential Leaders

**Discomfort with Status Quo**: Potential leaders see what could be improved. They're restless with "good enough." They generate ideas for better approaches without being asked.

**Influence Beyond Authority**: Before they have formal authority, potential leaders already influence peers. Others naturally look to them for guidance, opinions, and direction.

**Ownership Mentality**: Potential leaders treat problems as their problems, even when outside their defined responsibilities. They think about the organization's success, not just their job success.

**Appetite for Challenge**: Potential leaders seek out difficult assignments. They volunteer for stretch projects. They're drawn to problems others avoid.

**Internal Drive**: While appreciation is welcome, potential leaders are primarily motivated by internal standards. They push themselves harder than any boss would push them.

**People Investment**: Potential leaders naturally develop others, even before being asked. They mentor informally, share knowledge freely, and celebrate others' growth.

## The POTENTIAL Framework

Use this framework to systematically evaluate leadership potential:

### P — Proven Track Record

What has this person accomplished? Look for:
- Achievements beyond job requirements
- Success in challenging situations
- Evidence of initiative and self-direction
- Results that exceeded expectations

**Warning Sign**: Someone who has always been in supportive roles without evidence of independent achievement may lack the drive for leadership.

### O — Opportunity Seeker

How does this person respond to opportunities? Look for:
- Volunteering for difficult assignments
- Seeking responsibility beyond their role
- Finding opportunity in problems others see as obstacles
- Creating opportunities where none existed

**Warning Sign**: Someone who waits to be assigned, even excellent assignees, may lack the proactive orientation leadership requires.

### T — Thinking Ability

Can this person think strategically? Look for:
- Understanding of how parts connect to wholes
- Ability to see long-term consequences
- Systems thinking rather than just event thinking
- Questioning assumptions others accept

**Warning Sign**: Someone who executes brilliantly but cannot explain why they're doing what they're doing may lack the conceptual ability for leadership.

### E — Emotional Intelligence

How does this person navigate relationships? Look for:
- Self-awareness about strengths and weaknesses
- Ability to read others accurately
- Managing emotions under pressure
- Building authentic relationships across differences

**Warning Sign**: Someone brilliant but unable to work effectively with others will struggle to lead.

### N — Natural Influence

Does this person already influence others? Look for:
- People seeking their opinion informally
- Ability to persuade without authority
- Credibility with peers
- Others following their lead voluntarily

**Warning Sign**: Someone who cannot influence as a peer will struggle to influence as a leader.

### T — Teachability

Is this person committed to growth? Look for:
- Response to feedback (defensive or learning)
- Self-initiated development activities
- Curiosity about new ideas and approaches
- Humility about what they don't know

**Warning Sign**: Someone who believes they've "arrived" will plateau quickly.

### I — Integrity

Does this person's character support leadership? Look for:
- Consistency between words and actions
- Honoring commitments, especially difficult ones
- Truth-telling even when inconvenient
- Treating all people with respect

**Warning Sign**: Character defects don't improve with promotion—they're amplified.

### A — Alignment

Does this person fit your culture and values? Look for:
- Genuine commitment to organizational mission
- Values alignment (not just compliance)
- Cultural fit with leadership team
- Long-term orientation versus short-term career moves

**Warning Sign**: Developing a leader who will leave for misalignment wastes your investment.

### L — Leadership of Self

Can this person lead themselves first? Look for:
- Discipline and self-management
- Accountability without supervision
- Managing their own energy and renewal
- Following through without external pressure

**Warning Sign**: Someone who cannot lead themselves cannot lead others.

## Assessment Methods

### Observation Over Time

The best assessment comes from watching people in real situations over extended periods. Notice:
- How they respond to unexpected challenges
- What they do when no one is watching
- How they treat people who can't help them
- Whether they grow from feedback

### Stretch Assignments

Create opportunities that test leadership potential:
- Lead a small project with ambiguous directions
- Handle a difficult interpersonal situation
- Represent the team in a cross-functional setting
- Solve a problem with inadequate resources

Watch how they approach these challenges, not just whether they succeed.

### Behavioral Interviews

Ask questions that reveal leadership orientation:
- "Tell me about a time you saw a problem no one else was addressing. What did you do?"
- "Describe a situation where you influenced others without having authority over them."
- "What's something you've done to develop another person's abilities?"
- "How do you respond when you receive feedback you disagree with?"

### Reference Conversations

Ask references specifically about leadership potential:
- "Would you want to work for this person?"
- "Have they ever developed others successfully?"
- "How do they respond under pressure?"
- "What's their greatest leadership weakness?"

## Common Identification Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Confusing Performance with Potential

Top performers are not automatically top leadership candidates. Excellence in execution doesn't guarantee excellence in developing others' execution. Many organizations promote their best individual contributors into leadership, losing a great performer and gaining a struggling leader.

### Mistake 2: Selecting for Similarity

Leaders often identify potential in people who remind them of themselves. This creates homogeneous leadership teams lacking diverse perspectives. Consciously seek potential in people who think differently, have different backgrounds, and bring different strengths.

### Mistake 3: Overweighting Intelligence

Raw intelligence matters but isn't sufficient. Leadership requires emotional intelligence, interpersonal skills, and execution ability that don't correlate with IQ. Some of the smartest people make terrible leaders because they can't relate to average performers.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Character

The pressure of leadership reveals character. Leaders without integrity eventually damage the organization, often catastrophically. Never promote character defects hoping they'll improve—they won't.

### Mistake 5: Rushing the Assessment

True potential reveals itself over time and across situations. Snap judgments about potential often miss important information. Take time to observe people in multiple contexts before making development investments.

## Case Study Analysis

### Case Study 1: The Brilliant Individual Contributor

**Context**: James was the best software engineer at his company—fastest coder, fewest bugs, most elegant solutions. When a team lead position opened, he was the obvious choice. Everyone expected him to excel.

**The Problem**: James had never shown interest in others' development. He preferred working alone. He was impatient with slower colleagues. He had strong opinions but poor influence skills. The company promoted performance without assessing leadership potential.

**The Outcome**: As team lead, James became frustrated with "managing people who can't keep up." His team's morale dropped, turnover spiked, and productivity declined despite James working harder than ever. After two years, James asked to return to individual contribution, and the company had to rebuild a damaged team.

**The Lesson**: Outstanding individual performance doesn't indicate leadership potential. Assessment must specifically evaluate leadership characteristics.

### Case Study 2: The Unexpected Leader

**Context**: Maria was a solid but not spectacular performer in customer service. She hadn't sought promotion and wasn't on any leadership radar. But a new director noticed something: whenever there was a problem, Maria's colleagues came to her. She informally mentored new hires. She solved interpersonal conflicts that supervisors couldn't.

**The Assessment**: The director began observing Maria closely. She watched Maria handle an irate customer with patience and skill. She saw Maria coach a struggling colleague through a difficult period. She noticed Maria's peers trusted her judgment and sought her advice.

**The Outcome**: The director invested in Maria's development. Within three years, Maria was managing the largest customer service team and had developed four supervisors who developed their own team leads. Her multiplication impact far exceeded the "obvious" promotion candidates.

**The Lesson**: Potential isn't always visible in traditional performance metrics. Look for informal influence, natural development of others, and character revealed under pressure.

### Case Study 3: The Developing Discernment

**Context**: Robert, a CEO, had made several poor leadership development choices early in his career. He promoted people who looked good in interviews but failed in execution. He missed potential in quiet performers. His mistakes were costly.

**The Learning Process**: Robert committed to improving his identification skills. He created the habit of observing potential leaders for six months before development investment. He tested candidates with stretch assignments. He sought input from people who worked with candidates daily. He tracked his predictions against outcomes.

**The Outcome**: After five years of deliberate practice, Robert's identification accuracy improved dramatically. His development investments paid off consistently. He built a leadership team that others envied. His organization became known for developing leaders who went on to lead other companies.

**The Lesson**: Identifying potential is a skill that improves with deliberate practice, honest assessment of mistakes, and systematic observation over time.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Observation Project

Select three people in your organization you're unsure about regarding leadership potential. For the next 30 days, observe them specifically:
- How do they respond when given ambiguous direction?
- Who comes to them informally for help?
- What do they do with discretionary time?
- How do they handle setbacks or criticism?

Document your observations and assess using the POTENTIAL framework.

### Exercise 2: The Stretch Assignment Test

Design a stretch assignment for someone you believe has leadership potential. The assignment should:
- Require them to influence without authority
- Present ambiguous challenges without clear solutions
- Give them opportunity to develop others
- Test their character under pressure

Observe how they approach the assignment, not just whether they succeed.

### Exercise 3: The Prediction Log

Start tracking your leadership potential predictions:
- When you identify someone as high potential, write down why
- When you decide someone lacks potential, write down why
- Review your predictions after one and two years
- Analyze your accuracy patterns to improve future identification

## Reflection Questions

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Looking at leaders you've successfully developed and those who disappointed, what distinguishes them? What patterns can you identify that would improve future identification?

2. **Blind Spots**: What biases might affect your identification of potential? Do you favor people similar to you? Overlook quiet contributors? Overweight education or experience?

3. **Missed Potential**: Think of someone you overlooked who later demonstrated significant leadership ability. What did you miss? How could you have seen their potential earlier?

4. **Current Assessment**: Who on your current team has the highest leadership potential that you haven't yet invested in developing? What's holding you back?

5. **Identification Investment**: How much time do you currently spend specifically on identifying and assessing leadership potential? Is this enough? What would happen if you doubled it?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "When I look at a person, I see their future, not their past. I see what they can become, not just what they've been." — John Maxwell

The leader's gift is seeing potential that isn't yet visible—recognizing what someone could become before they become it. This requires both discernment and faith: discernment to see accurate indicators of potential, and faith to invest before potential is proven. The multiplication leader develops this sight through deliberate practice, systematic observation, and willingness to take measured risks on unproven potential. They see future leaders in current individual contributors, future executives in current managers, and future culture shapers in current team members. This future-sight is what enables multiplication.
