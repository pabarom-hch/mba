# Week 47, Day 2: Sources of Influence

> "People buy into the leader before they buy into the vision. If they don't buy into you, they won't follow." — John Maxwell

## The Core Insight

Influence doesn't emerge from a single source—it flows from multiple springs that can be developed, combined, and strategically deployed. Today, we explore these sources systematically, understanding how each operates, how to develop each, and how they interact to create compound influence.

Different situations call for different influence sources. The source that works in a crisis may fail in steady-state operations. The source that influences executives may not move front-line employees. Masterful influence means having multiple sources available and knowing which to deploy when.

Most leaders over-rely on one or two influence sources while neglecting others. They've developed what works for them in familiar contexts but struggle when those familiar sources don't apply. Expanding your influence sources expands the contexts where you can lead effectively.

## The Seven Sources of Influence

Maxwell identifies multiple pathways through which influence develops. Each represents a distinct mechanism that affects how and why people follow.

### Source 1: Position

Position is the most basic influence source—the formal authority that comes with a title or role. It's the starting point but shouldn't be the ending point.

**How It Works**: Position grants you certain organizational powers: to direct resources, make decisions within scope, access information, and represent the organization. People comply with positional authority because the organization expects it.

**Limitations**: Position produces compliance, not commitment. It works only within its formal scope. It depletes quickly if not supplemented by other sources. It disappears when the position changes.

**Development Strategy**: While you shouldn't rely solely on position, you should use it strategically. Position creates opportunities to demonstrate other influence sources. Use positional authority to establish conditions where your other influence sources can develop.

### Source 2: Permission (Relationships)

Permission-based influence comes from relationship—people follow because they want to, because the relationship makes following feel right.

**How It Works**: When you invest in people genuinely—listening, caring, supporting—they grant permission for you to influence them. They open themselves to your ideas because they trust your intentions. They follow because they want to, not because they have to.

**Development Approach**:
- Invest time in knowing people as individuals
- Listen more than you speak
- Remember and follow up on personal matters
- Show genuine care beyond their instrumental value
- Be accessible and present
- Create psychological safety in relationship

**Indicators You Have It**: People seek you out. They share problems early. They give you the benefit of the doubt. They follow willingly without requiring directives.

### Source 3: Production (Results)

Results create influence. When you consistently deliver outcomes, people believe in your judgment and follow your direction because they expect it to lead somewhere good.

**How It Works**: Track record creates credibility. People who have seen you succeed trust that your current direction will succeed. Results demonstrate competence that makes following logical.

**Development Approach**:
- Focus on delivering tangible outcomes
- Make your results visible without self-promotion
- Connect your actions to organizational success
- Build a pattern of consistent delivery
- Turn around visible problems
- Celebrate team results while accepting personal accountability for failures

**Indicators You Have It**: People cite your past successes. They assume your initiatives will work. They join your projects because they expect outcomes. Your track record precedes you.

### Source 4: People Development

Leaders who develop others earn influence from everyone who's benefited from their investment and everyone who's witnessed it.

**How It Works**: When you invest in developing someone's capabilities and career, you create lasting influence with them. Beyond that, others observe your investment in people and see you as someone worth following—someone who will invest in them too.

**Development Approach**:
- Actively mentor and coach others
- Create developmental opportunities for team members
- Give feedback that helps people grow
- Share credit generously
- Provide stretch assignments
- Invest in people even when there's no clear return

**Indicators You Have It**: Proteges speak highly of your impact. People compete to work for you. Your alumni stay connected. Your reputation for developing people precedes you.

### Source 5: Personhood (Character)

Character creates deep, sustainable influence. Who you are—your integrity, values, and moral courage—becomes a source of influence that transcends any particular context or relationship.

**How It Works**: When people perceive authentic character—that you're genuinely good, not just strategically good—they grant influence that doesn't require constant maintenance. They follow because you're worth following as a person, not just as a role-holder.

**Development Approach**:
- Practice integrity even when no one's watching
- Admit mistakes and apologize genuinely
- Stand for something larger than self-interest
- Demonstrate courage in difficult situations
- Treat everyone with dignity regardless of status
- Keep commitments consistently

**Indicators You Have It**: People trust you quickly. They share sensitive information. They believe you in ambiguous situations. They attribute good motives to your actions.

### Source 6: Expertise

Deep knowledge and skill in areas that matter create influence. People follow those who know what they're doing.

**How It Works**: Expertise creates credibility in a domain. When you clearly know more about something important than others do, they defer to your judgment in that area. Expertise influence is domain-specific but can be profound within its scope.

**Development Approach**:
- Develop genuine mastery in areas critical to your context
- Stay current as your field evolves
- Share your expertise generously
- Demonstrate expertise through insight, not just claim
- Acknowledge the boundaries of your expertise
- Connect your expertise to organizational needs

**Indicators You Have It**: People seek your opinion in your domain. They defer to your judgment on technical matters. Your expertise is cited by others. You're the person consulted on specific topics.

### Source 7: Inspiration

Some leaders inspire—they create emotional energy, belief, and motivation that moves people toward possibility.

**How It Works**: Inspiration creates influence through emotional connection to vision, values, and purpose. People follow because you make them feel that something meaningful is possible and that following you is part of something larger than themselves.

**Development Approach**:
- Articulate compelling visions of the future
- Connect daily work to larger meaning
- Show genuine passion and belief
- Celebrate wins and progress
- Remain optimistic through difficulty
- Model the engagement you want to create

**Indicators You Have It**: People feel energized after interacting with you. They share your vision with others. They go beyond requirements. They speak of purpose, not just tasks.

## The Interaction of Sources

Influence sources interact multiplicatively, not additively. Strong performance in one source amplifies the effectiveness of others.

### Compound Influence

Consider two leaders:

**Leader A** has strong position but weak relationships, moderate results, and no people development track record. Their influence reaches a ceiling—compliance without commitment, limited to formal authority scope.

**Leader B** has the same position plus strong relationships, strong results, active people development, and demonstrable character. Each source amplifies the others: relationships make results more visible, results validate people investment, character makes relationships deeper. The compound effect creates influence far beyond any single source.

### Source Sequencing

Different career stages emphasize different sources:

**Early Career**: Results and expertise establish credibility. Position is limited. Relationships begin developing.

**Mid-Career**: People development and relationships become central. Results continue mattering. Position expands.

**Senior Leadership**: Character and inspiration become paramount. All other sources should be established. Position is significant but insufficient alone.

**CEO Level**: Every source matters simultaneously. Deficiency in any source limits overall influence. Integration of all sources distinguishes great leadership.

### Contextual Source Selection

Different situations call for different source emphasis:

| Situation | Primary Source | Supporting Sources |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Crisis | Results, Position | Expertise, Character |
| Transformation | Inspiration, Character | People Development, Relationships |
| Steady-state operations | People Development, Relationships | Results, Expertise |
| Technical decisions | Expertise | Results, Character |
| Cultural change | Character, Inspiration | Relationships, People Development |

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Single-Source Leader

**Background**: David Chen rose to VP of Engineering through technical brilliance. His expertise was unquestioned—he could solve problems no one else could. But as VP, his influence plateaued.

**The Limitation**: David's influence came almost entirely from expertise. He hadn't developed relationships with peers in other functions. He hadn't invested in developing his team's capabilities. His results were individual, not organizational. He had position but used it minimally.

**The Consequence**: When David proposed a major architectural change requiring cross-functional commitment, he couldn't get traction. Other VPs didn't feel connected to him. His own team couldn't articulate the vision because he'd never developed their understanding. His expertise was respected but not followed.

**The Lesson**: Single-source influence creates single-context effectiveness. David's expertise made him influential in technical decisions but left him powerless in organizational dynamics where relationship, people development, and inspiration mattered more.

### Case Study 2: The Multi-Source Builder

**Background**: Amira Okonjo joined a struggling division as General Manager. She had position, but her predecessor had burned through positional authority through repeated failures.

**The Multi-Source Strategy**: Amira deliberately built multiple influence sources:

- **Relationships**: Spent first 60 days listening to every stakeholder, building genuine connection
- **Results**: Identified quick wins that demonstrated her judgment while building toward larger outcomes
- **People Development**: Immediately began investing in her team's growth, sending signal about her values
- **Character**: Handled an inherited ethical issue transparently, even though it cost short-term results
- **Expertise**: Demonstrated strategic thinking that helped people see possibilities they'd missed
- **Inspiration**: Articulated a vision of what the division could become that captured imagination

**The Outcome**: Within 18 months, Amira's division transformed from struggling to leading. More importantly, her influence extended beyond her position—other divisions sought her input, the CEO relied on her judgment, and her team showed extraordinary commitment.

**The Lesson**: Multi-source influence creates compound effects. Each source Amira developed amplified the others, creating influence that far exceeded what any single source could generate.

### Case Study 3: The Source Mismatch

**Background**: Patricia Wells was promoted to CEO based on her inspirational leadership. She could articulate vision and create emotional engagement that moved people. The board hoped her inspiration would energize a complacent organization.

**The Mismatch**: Patricia's inspiration source, while powerful, wasn't supported by other sources. She hadn't developed operational expertise. Her results track record was in building movements, not executing operations. She hadn't invested in relationships throughout the organization.

**The Problem**: Initial enthusiasm from Patricia's inspiration faded as operational problems persisted. People were inspired by the vision but frustrated by execution gaps. Her lack of operational expertise meant she couldn't diagnose problems. Her weak organizational relationships meant she didn't hear about issues until they became crises.

**The Recovery**: Patricia eventually recognized the mismatch. She hired a strong COO who had the operational expertise and results orientation she lacked. She began deliberately building organizational relationships. She continued inspiring but complemented it with other sources.

**The Lesson**: Influence sources must match context. Patricia's inspiration was valuable but insufficient alone for CEO-level leadership. The gap between her strongest source and her context's requirements created struggle that only source expansion resolved.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Personal Source Assessment

Evaluate your strength in each influence source.

| Source | Strength (1-10) | Evidence | Development Priority |
|--------|-----------------|----------|---------------------|
| Position | | | |
| Permission (Relationships) | | | |
| Production (Results) | | | |
| People Development | | | |
| Personhood (Character) | | | |
| Expertise | | | |
| Inspiration | | | |

**Reflection**: Which sources are your strongest? Which are underdeveloped? How does this source profile match your leadership context?

### Application 2: Source-Context Alignment

Assess how well your influence sources match your most critical leadership contexts.

| Critical Context | Primary Source Needed | Your Strength in It | Gap/Alignment |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Reflection**: Where are your influence sources well-matched to context? Where are there gaps? What's the cost of source-context mismatch?

### Application 3: Source Development Planning

Create a development plan for underdeveloped sources.

| Source to Develop | Current Level | Target Level | Development Activities | Timeline |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|----------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Reflection**: What would developing these sources unlock? What's your commitment to the development activities?

### Application 4: Source Integration Map

Map how your various sources interact and compound.

| Source Combination | How They Interact | Current Strength | Integration Opportunity |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Relationships + Results | | | |
| Expertise + Character | | | |
| People Development + Inspiration | | | |
| Position + Permission | | | |

**Reflection**: How do your sources compound—or fail to compound? What integration work would multiply your overall influence?

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Source Audit Interview (45 minutes)

Ask a trusted colleague or coach to assess your influence sources:

"From your observation, which influence sources do I most rely on? Where am I strongest? Where am I weakest? Where do you see me struggling because a source is underdeveloped?"

Listen without defensiveness. External perspective often reveals source gaps invisible to self-assessment.

### Exercise 2: The Influence Moment Analysis (30 minutes)

Recall three recent moments when you successfully influenced an outcome and three moments when you failed to influence despite trying.

For each moment:
- What sources did you deploy?
- What sources were missing?
- What source would have changed the outcome?

Document patterns. Do you consistently deploy the same sources? Do you consistently lack the same sources when influence fails?

### Exercise 3: The Source Stretching Week (ongoing)

Choose your weakest influence source. This week, deliberately emphasize it:

- If relationships are weak, schedule connection conversations with no agenda
- If results visibility is low, share an update on recent accomplishments
- If people development is neglected, invest in a specific developmental conversation
- If expertise isn't being shared, teach something valuable
- If inspiration is missing, articulate vision in an upcoming communication

Track what happens when you exercise an underdeveloped source. Note discomfort, reactions, and results.

## Reflection Questions

1. **Source History**: How did you develop the influence sources you currently have? Which developed naturally versus deliberately? What does this history teach about future development?

2. **Source Comfort**: Which sources feel most natural to deploy? Which feel uncomfortable or inauthentic? Is discomfort a sign of development opportunity or misalignment with who you are?

3. **Source Balance**: Are your influence sources balanced, or heavily weighted toward one or two? What would better balance enable?

4. **Context Evolution**: As your leadership context evolves—larger scope, different challenges, new organizations—how must your source mix evolve?

5. **Authenticity Question**: Can you develop influence sources that don't come naturally while remaining authentic? How do you develop without becoming performative?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "When you become a leader, success is all about growing others. It's about making the people who work with you smarter, bigger, and bolder." — Jack Welch (quoted by Maxwell)

**Analysis**: Welch's quote, cited by Maxwell, emphasizes the people development source. But it also illuminates how sources interact: developing others creates compound influence. You become more influential with those you develop. Your reputation as a developer attracts more talented followers. Your developed people amplify your impact. One source—people development—compounds through multiple mechanisms.

## Tomorrow's Preview

Tomorrow we'll explore **Positional vs. Personal Influence**—the crucial distinction between influence that comes from your role and influence you've earned through who you are and what you've done. This distinction helps diagnose influence gaps and reveals why some leaders thrive in any context while others struggle when their position changes.
