# Week 52, Day 6: Year Assessment

> "The unexamined life is not worth living." — Socrates (embraced by all 8 mentors)

## The Core Insight

As this year of CEO development concludes, honest assessment matters. Not self-congratulation. Not self-criticism. Honest assessment of where you started, where you are, and what the gap reveals. This assessment is not an ending but a waypoint—understanding your current position so you can chart the next phase of development.

Assessment without action is academic. Action without assessment is blind. The Complete CEO practices both.

## The Honest Assessment

### Areas of Greatest Growth

Looking at the assessment above, identify your three areas of greatest growth:

| Area | Beginning | Now | Key Factor in Growth |
|------|-----------|-----|---------------------|
| 1. | | | |
| 2. | | | |
| 3. | | | |

### Areas of Least Growth

Identify your three areas of least growth:

| Area | Beginning | Now | Primary Barrier |
|------|-----------|-----|-----------------|
| 1. | | | |
| 2. | | | |
| 3. | | | |

### Surprising Discoveries

What surprised you about your development this year?
1. What capability developed more than expected?
2. What capability developed less than expected?
3. What did you learn about yourself?
4. What changed about your leadership?

### The Gap Analysis

| Foundation | Target State | Current State | Gap | Priority |
|------------|-------------|---------------|-----|----------|
| Thinking | 8/10 | | | |

## External Validation

### The 360 Check

Self-assessment has blind spots. Seek external perspective:

**Ask Your Direct Reports**:
- How has my leadership changed this year?
- Where have you seen the most growth?
- Where do I still need to develop?

**Ask Your Peers**:
- How has my strategic thinking changed?
- How has my collaboration changed?
- What development do you recommend?

**Ask Your Board/Supervisor**:
- How has my CEO effectiveness changed?
- Where have you seen the most improvement?
- What gaps remain?

### Reality Check Questions

| Question | Self-Assessment | External Feedback | Gap to Reconcile |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Is my thinking clearer than a year ago? | | | |
| Am I building organization more effectively? | | | |
| Is my character demonstrably stronger? | | | |
| Am I a more effective leader? | | | |
| Do others see the growth I believe I've made? | | | |

## The Mentor Review

### What Each Mentor Would Say

Imagine each mentor reviewing your year:

**Charlie Munger**: "Have you developed your latticework of mental models? Are you more rational? Do you avoid stupidity better?"

**Warren Buffett**: "Is your time horizon longer? Do you understand compounding better? Are you staying in your circle of competence?"

**Andrew Carnegie**: "Have you built a stronger mastermind? Are your systems better? Can your organization do more?"

**Napoleon Hill**: "Is your purpose clearer? Are you more persistent? Do you apply achievement principles?"

**Jim Rohn**: "Have you worked harder on yourself than on your job? Are you a more developed person? Have you created better daily disciplines?"

**Mahatma Gandhi**: "Are you being the change? Is your principle application consistent? Are you leading through moral authority?"

**Nelson Mandela**: "Can you persist through greater adversity? Are you transforming rather than just transacting? Are you developing leaders?"

**John Maxwell**: "Do you understand and apply the leadership laws better? Are you multiplying leadership? What's your legacy trajectory?"

### Your Mentor Report Card

| Mentor | Grade | Primary Strength | Primary Gap |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Munger | | | |
| Buffett | | | |
| Carnegie | | | |
| Hill | | | |
| Rohn | | | |
| Gandhi | | | |
| Mandela | | | |
| Maxwell | | | |

## Case Study: The Year Assessment

### The CEO's Journey

CEO Maria Santos began this curriculum with significant blind spots:
- Strong strategic thinker but poor people developer
- Good vision but weak systems
- High integrity but inconsistent behavior under pressure
- Respected but not multiplying leadership

### The Year's Work

Maria engaged seriously with each quarter:
- Q1: She developed five new mental models and applied them consistently
- Q2: She rebuilt her leadership team and invested in systems
- Q3: She established morning development routine and closed integrity gaps
- Q4: She developed three leaders who began developing others

### The Honest Assessment

**Significant Growth**:
- Mental model application: 4 → 7
- Leadership team quality: 5 → 8
- Personal development habit: 3 → 8
- Leadership multiplication: 2 → 6

**Limited Growth**:
- Long-term orientation: 6 → 6.5 (slight improvement)
- Emotional rationality: 5 → 5.5 (still struggles under pressure)
- Being the change: 6 → 7 (improved but gaps remain)

**Integration**:
- Thinking + Leadership: Strong—uses mental models in leadership decisions
- Being + Building: Weak—character development not yet reflected in organization building

### Maria's Conclusion

"I've grown significantly but have further to go. My biggest growth was in areas I didn't know were weak—I didn't know how poor my leadership multiplication was. My remaining gaps are in areas I thought I was good at—I still struggle with rationality under pressure. The year has been valuable, but I'm nowhere near complete."

### The Lesson

Honest assessment reveals both progress and remaining gaps. The year is a waypoint, not a destination. Growth creates awareness of further growth needed.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Year Letter

Write a letter from your future self one year from now:
1. What has changed?
2. What are you most proud of?
3. What advice would you give your current self?
4. What were the key decisions that made the difference?

Let this future self guide your planning.

### Exercise 2: The Development Interview

Conduct a development interview with yourself:
1. What was your greatest leadership success this year?
2. What was your greatest leadership failure?
3. What did you learn from each?
4. How will that learning shape next year?

Record your answers. Review them next year.

### Exercise 3: The Mentor Conversation

Imagine a conversation with all eight mentors:
1. What would you ask each one about your development?
2. What do you think they would say?
3. What would their collective advice be?
4. What action will you take based on that advice?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. **Progress Honesty**: Have you been truly honest in your assessment, or have you been too generous or too harsh? What would complete honesty reveal?

2. **External Reality**: Does external feedback match your self-assessment? Where are the gaps? What do those gaps tell you?

3. **Barrier Pattern**: What patterns do you see in your development barriers? Are the same barriers appearing across multiple areas?

4. **Development Trajectory**: If your development continues at this year's pace, where will you be in five years? Is that trajectory acceptable?

5. **Next Priority**: Based on this assessment, what is the single most important development priority for next year? Why this one?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Honest assessment is the foundation of continued growth. The leader who cannot see themselves clearly cannot develop themselves deliberately. Assessment without action is academic; action without assessment is blind. The Complete CEO does both."

The year assessment is not about judgment—it's about clarity. Clarity about where you started, where you are, and where you need to go. The assessment reveals not just gaps but also patterns—what develops easily and what resists development, what external support helps and what internal commitment is needed. This clarity is the foundation for designing the next phase of your development journey.

## Tomorrow's Preview

Tomorrow, the final day of the curriculum, is **Looking Forward**—translating this assessment into a concrete plan for continued development as a Complete CEO.

*"The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance."*
