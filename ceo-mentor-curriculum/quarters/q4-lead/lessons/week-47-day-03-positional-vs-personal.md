# Week 47, Day 3: Positional vs. Personal Influence

> "Position is a poor substitute for influence. People may follow you because they have to, but that's not really following—that's compliance. True following comes from influence earned, not authority granted." — John Maxwell

## The Core Insight

A critical distinction separates two types of influence: positional influence that comes with your role, and personal influence you've earned independently of any title. Understanding this distinction reveals why some leaders thrive in any context while others struggle when their position changes, why some achieve only compliance while others inspire commitment, and why title-based leadership consistently underperforms relationship-based leadership.

Positional influence is borrowed—temporarily granted by the organization. Personal influence is owned—developed through who you are and how you've behaved. When you rely on borrowed influence, you're dependent on organizational structures that can change. When you've built personal influence, you carry it with you regardless of context.

The CEOs who transform organizations, retain talent through difficulty, and leave lasting legacies have developed personal influence that far exceeds their positional authority. Those who merely occupy the CEO chair, achieving compliance without commitment, have failed to convert positional opportunity into personal influence.

## The Nature of Positional Influence

Positional influence derives from formal authority, organizational structure, and institutional expectations.

### What Position Provides

**Decision Authority**: The formal right to make certain decisions and allocate certain resources. Your position specifies what you can decide without permission.

**Information Access**: Higher positions typically have access to more and better information. Information advantage creates influence opportunity.

**Reward and Consequence Control**: Many positions include authority to affect compensation, advancement, assignments, and termination. This control creates compliance-based influence.

**Representation Authority**: Positions grant the right to speak for the organization in certain contexts. When you speak as CEO, your words carry organizational weight.

**Relationship Access**: Positions provide access to relationships—board members, investors, peer executives—that might otherwise be unavailable.

### The Limits of Position

Despite its advantages, positional influence has severe limitations:

**Scope Boundary**: Position only creates influence within its defined scope. The CEO has positional influence over the organization but limited positional influence with customers, partners, or industry peers.

**Compliance Ceiling**: Position produces compliance but not commitment. People follow because they have to, not because they want to. Compliance is minimum acceptable behavior; commitment is discretionary effort.

**Depletion Without Replenishment**: Positional influence depletes over time if not supplemented. Initial deference fades as people assess whether you merit the influence your position grants.

**Context Dependency**: When you leave the position, you leave the positional influence. It doesn't transfer to new contexts. Leaders who rely solely on position often struggle when they change roles.

**Authenticity Questions**: People assess whether you deserve your position. If they conclude you don't, your positional influence erodes rapidly. Position without demonstrated merit creates cynicism.

## The Nature of Personal Influence

Personal influence develops from who you are and how you've behaved—independent of any formal role.

### What Personal Influence Provides

**Followership by Choice**: People follow because they want to, because they believe in you, because following you serves their values and interests. This voluntary followership generates commitment.

**Context Portability**: Personal influence transfers across roles and organizations. When you change positions, your personal influence comes with you.

**Resilience**: Personal influence persists through challenges. When things go wrong, people who follow you personally maintain commitment. People who follow only your position defect when the position weakens.

**Extended Scope**: Personal influence can extend beyond any formal authority. You can influence people who don't report to you, organizations you don't lead, and contexts where you hold no position.

**Authentic Connection**: Personal influence creates genuine relationship. People engage with you as a person, not just as a position-holder.

### How Personal Influence Develops

Personal influence builds through:

**Demonstrated Character**: When people see who you really are—especially in difficulty—they decide whether you're worth following. Character revealed earns influence that position can't buy.

**Consistent Behavior**: Over time, people learn what to expect from you. Consistency creates trust. Trust creates willingness to follow.

**Genuine Investment**: When you invest in people authentically—not strategically, but genuinely—they become personally connected. That connection becomes influence.

**Results That Matter**: Delivering outcomes people care about creates belief in your judgment. That belief becomes influence.

**Values Alignment**: When people perceive that your values align with theirs, following you becomes following their own values. This creates deep, sustainable influence.

## The Position-Personal Ratio

Most leaders have some combination of positional and personal influence. The ratio matters enormously.

### High Position, Low Personal

Leaders who have high positional influence but low personal influence:
- Achieve compliance without commitment
- Experience high turnover of talented people
- Struggle when facing organizational resistance
- Find their initiatives implemented minimally
- Leave organizations that struggle after their departure
- Feel isolated at the top

### Low Position, High Personal

Leaders who have high personal influence but low positional influence:
- Influence beyond their formal authority
- Attract followers without formal reporting relationships
- Are sought out for guidance and input
- Shape organizational direction informally
- May feel frustrated by positional constraints
- Often get promoted to positions matching their influence

### High Position, High Personal

Leaders who have both high positional and personal influence:
- Generate both compliance and commitment
- Retain talented people through connection
- Navigate resistance through relationship
- See initiatives embraced beyond requirements
- Leave organizations stronger than they found them
- Feel connected despite hierarchical distance

This is the target state: converting positional opportunity into personal influence so that both are high.

## Converting Position to Personal Influence

The opportunity in position is conversion—using the platform position provides to build personal influence.

### The Conversion Process

**Day 1 Opportunity**: New positions come with a temporary surplus of positional influence—people give you the benefit of the doubt. Use this window to demonstrate personal influence characteristics before positional deference fades.

**Visibility Platform**: Position provides visibility that personal influence-building requires. Use the visibility to demonstrate character, connect authentically, and build relationship.

**Resource Access**: Position gives access to resources that can be invested in relationships and people development. Use positional resources to build personal influence.

**Decision Opportunities**: Every decision is a demonstration of judgment and values. Use decision moments to reveal who you are, building personal influence through how you exercise positional authority.

**Crisis Crucibles**: Crises reveal character. Position places you at the center of organizational crises. Use these moments to demonstrate what you're made of.

### Common Conversion Failures

Many leaders fail to convert position to personal influence:

**Comfort in Compliance**: Getting things done through positional authority is easier than building personal influence. The compliance is immediate; the influence is slow. Leaders who optimize for ease stay positional.

**Insecurity Protection**: Building personal influence requires vulnerability—genuine connection, admitting limitations, authentic relationship. Insecure leaders protect themselves with positional distance.

**Transactional Orientation**: Some leaders view leadership transactionally—authority for results. They don't invest in relationship beyond what transactions require. They never build personal influence.

**Time Horizon Mismatch**: Personal influence builds over years. Leaders with short time horizons—interim roles, imminent transitions—may not invest in influence they won't harvest.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Position Reliant

**Background**: Richard Thompson had been CEO of three companies over 20 years. Each tenure followed a similar pattern: initial authority-driven change, growing resistance, mounting frustration, and eventual departure—usually described as "mutual" but actually forced.

**The Pattern**: Richard relied heavily on positional authority. He directed change rather than building buy-in. He expected compliance based on his title. He maintained hierarchical distance rather than developing relationships. He evaluated people on results without investing in their development.

**The Consequence**: Each organization complied with Richard's direction while he was present and powerful. But talented people left. Those who remained implemented minimally. When Richard faced challenges, he had no reservoir of personal influence to draw on. His positional authority—weakened by results that never quite met expectations—wasn't enough.

**The Realization**: After his third departure, Richard worked with a coach who helped him see the pattern. His positional influence had always been high—he'd held powerful roles. But his personal influence had never developed. He'd relied on borrowed influence his entire career.

**The Lesson**: You can achieve a CEO title without developing personal influence—but you can't achieve CEO impact without it. Richard's career demonstrated that positional authority alone produces a pattern of diminishing returns.

### Case Study 2: The Influence Investor

**Background**: Grace Nakamura took over as CEO of a company where her predecessor had destroyed trust. The organization was cynical, exhausted, and skeptical that any CEO could be different. Her positional influence was near zero—the position itself had been discredited.

**The Strategy**: Grace knew she couldn't rely on position—it had been poisoned. She would need to build personal influence from scratch. Her strategy:

- She held personal conversations with every director and above—not to announce plans, but to listen and connect
- She made decisions transparently, explaining her reasoning and acknowledging uncertainty
- She admitted what she didn't know and asked for help
- When she made mistakes, she apologized publicly and genuinely
- She protected people who told her hard truths
- She celebrated others' contributions while taking responsibility for failures

**The Outcome**: Within two years, Grace had developed personal influence that far exceeded the positional influence her predecessor had squandered. People followed her because of who she was, not her title. The organization transformed—not through her authority but through her influence.

**The Lesson**: Personal influence can be built even when positional influence is absent or damaged. Grace's situation, while challenging, demonstrated that influence fundamentally resides in the person, not the position.

### Case Study 3: The Transition Test

**Background**: Michael Chen had been a highly effective division president with strong positional influence and, he believed, strong personal influence. When the CEO role opened at a peer company, he was recruited.

**The Transition Shock**: Michael arrived at his new company expecting to lead as he had led his division. But his influence didn't transfer. People didn't know him. His track record was stories, not lived experience. His relationships had to be built from scratch.

**The Revelation**: Michael realized that much of what he'd thought was personal influence was actually positional—specific to his role in his previous organization. His relationships were role-dependent. His track record was organization-specific. His influence had been less portable than he'd believed.

**The Adaptation**: Michael adjusted his approach. Rather than assuming influence, he invested in building it. He spent more time on relationship development than he had in years. He demonstrated judgment rather than asserting it. He built credibility through new results rather than citing old ones.

**The Lesson**: Transitions reveal the position-personal ratio. What seems like personal influence in one context may be position-dependent. True personal influence—the kind that transfers—requires deliberate cultivation beyond any specific role.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Position-Personal Ratio Assessment

Honestly assess your current ratio.

| Influence Dimension | From Position (%) | From Personal (%) | Evidence |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Executive Team Influence | | | |
| Board Influence | | | |
| Organizational Influence | | | |
| Industry Influence | | | |
| Stakeholder Influence | | | |

**Reflection**: What's your overall position-personal ratio? What evidence supports this assessment? If you lost your position tomorrow, how much influence would remain?

### Application 2: Conversion Opportunity Identification

Identify opportunities to convert positional advantages into personal influence.

| Positional Advantage | Personal Influence Opportunity | Conversion Action | Timeline |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Decision authority | Demonstrate judgment and values | | |
| Information access | Share transparently, build trust | | |
| Relationship access | Convert access to genuine connection | | |
| Visibility | Model character under observation | | |
| Resource control | Invest in people and relationship | | |

**Reflection**: How deliberately are you converting positional opportunity to personal influence? What would more deliberate conversion look like?

### Application 3: Portable Influence Audit

Assess how much of your influence would transfer to a new context.

| Influence Asset | Transfer Probability | Required to Rebuild | Portability Strategy |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Reputation | | | |
| Relationships | | | |
| Skills | | | |
| Character perception | | | |
| Results track record | | | |

**Reflection**: If you changed roles tomorrow, how much influence would you bring with you? What would you need to rebuild?

### Application 4: Influence Foundation Self-Assessment

Assess whether your influence rests on a stable foundation.

| If This Changed... | Impact on My Influence | Stability Assessment |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| I lost my title | | |
| The organization struggled | | |
| Key relationships ended | | |
| My track record was questioned | | |
| I faced public failure | | |

**Reflection**: How stable is your influence foundation? What would destabilize it? How can you strengthen the foundation?

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Title-Removal Thought Experiment (20 minutes)

Imagine you lost your title tomorrow but stayed in your organization in an "advisor" role with no formal authority. You can attend meetings but cannot direct, decide, or command.

- How would you influence outcomes?
- Who would still listen to you?
- What personal influence tools would you deploy?
- Where would you struggle most?

The gaps this thought experiment reveals are the gaps in your personal influence.

### Exercise 2: The Influence Source Interview (30 minutes)

Ask a direct report you trust: "When you follow my direction, how much is because of my position and how much is because of me personally? What would you follow even if I weren't your boss? What would you question more if my title changed?"

Listen without defending. This external assessment often reveals ratio realities invisible to self-assessment.

### Exercise 3: The Conversion Tracking Month (ongoing)

For the next month, track every time you exercise influence:

| Date | Situation | Influence Type Used | Outcome | Conversion Opportunity? |
|------|-----------|--------------------|---------|-----------------------|
| | | Positional / Personal | | |

At month end, analyze: What's your actual ratio in practice? How often did you rely on position when personal might have worked? Where were conversion opportunities missed?

## Reflection Questions

1. **Honest Ratio**: If you're being completely honest, what percentage of your current influence is positional versus personal? What evidence would convince you the ratio is different than you believe?

2. **Conversion Attention**: How much deliberate attention do you give to converting positional opportunity into personal influence? Is this conversion happening by accident or by design?

3. **Portability Reality**: If you changed organizations, how much influence would you actually bring with you? What relationships, reputation, and credibility would need rebuilding?

4. **Compliance vs. Commitment**: In your organization, how much of what happens is compliance (people doing what they must) versus commitment (people doing what they choose)? What creates the difference?

5. **Legacy Influence**: When you eventually leave your current role, what personal influence will persist? How will people describe your leadership once the position is gone?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The position doesn't make the leader; the leader makes the position." — John Maxwell

**Analysis**: Maxwell's quote inverts common thinking. Many assume the position creates the leader—that CEO authority makes someone a CEO. Maxwell argues the reverse: the leader creates the position—their personal influence defines what the position means and accomplishes.

Two people can hold identical positions with radically different outcomes. The difference isn't the position; it's the personal influence each brings to it. The position is merely a platform; what's built on it depends on the builder.
