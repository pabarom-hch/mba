# Week 50, Day 4: Time Investment

> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." — African Proverb (often cited by John Maxwell)

## The Core Insight

Leadership development is not free—it costs time, the scarcest resource any CEO possesses. The question is not whether to invest time in developing leaders but how much time is required and how to allocate it effectively. Most CEOs dramatically underestimate the time investment required for genuine development while simultaneously wasting time on activities that could be delegated to developed leaders. The irony is profound: the time spent developing leaders is precisely what creates the time freedom CEOs seek.

Mastering time investment in leadership development is the key that unlocks multiplication.

## The Time Investment Reality

### What Development Actually Requires

Genuine leadership development is time-intensive. Here's what meaningful development of a single leader typically requires:

**Weekly Investment**:
- One-on-one meeting: 30-60 minutes
- Informal conversations and teachable moments: 30-60 minutes
- Review of their work and preparation for feedback: 30 minutes
- **Total**: 1.5-2.5 hours per week per developing leader

**Monthly Investment**:
- Extended development conversation: 1-2 hours
- Observation of their leadership in action: 2-4 hours
- Joint problem-solving on challenges: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: 4-8 hours per month per developing leader

**Quarterly Investment**:
- Development plan review and update: 2-3 hours
- Assessment against milestones: 1-2 hours
- Adjustment of development activities: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: 4-7 hours per quarter per developing leader

**Annual Estimated Total**: 150-200 hours per developing leader

### The Portfolio Reality

If you're developing five leaders—a minimum for meaningful multiplication—you're looking at 750-1,000 hours annually devoted to development. This represents 35-50% of your productive working time.

This seems impossible until you realize: the alternative is spending even more time doing work that developed leaders could be doing.

## The Time Investment Paradox

### The Paradox Explained

CEOs who invest heavily in developing leaders end up with more time than those who don't. The math works like this:

**Without Development Investment**:
- You remain the bottleneck for all major decisions
- Problems flow to you because no one else can handle them
- You work longer hours as the organization grows
- Growth is limited by your personal capacity

**With Development Investment**:
- Developed leaders handle decisions independently
- Problems are solved at lower levels
- You work on strategy while leaders handle operations
- Growth is limited by leadership pipeline, which you control

### The Investment Curve

In the short term (Year 1), development investment increases your workload. You're doing your job plus development.

In the medium term (Years 2-3), the investment begins to pay off. Developed leaders take on responsibilities you once carried.

In the long term (Years 3+), you achieve time liberation. Your calendar opens as leaders handle what once required you.

Most CEOs quit in Year 1, never experiencing the liberation that comes from sustained investment.

## Structuring Development Time

### The Protected Time Block

Development requires protected, uninterruptable time. This means:

**Scheduled, Recurring Meetings**: One-on-ones should be calendared and protected like board meetings. They happen unless genuine emergency intervenes.

**Preparation Time**: Block time before one-on-ones to review their work, prepare feedback, and plan development conversations.

**Recovery Time**: Block time after intense development sessions to process, document, and follow up.

### The Weekly Development Calendar

Example structure for a CEO developing five leaders:

| Day | Development Activity | Time |
|-----|---------------------|------|
| Monday | One-on-one with Leader A | 7:30-8:30 AM |
| Monday | One-on-one with Leader B | 4:00-5:00 PM |
| Tuesday | One-on-one with Leader C | 7:30-8:30 AM |
| Wednesday | One-on-one with Leader D | 7:30-8:30 AM |
| Wednesday | Group development session | 12:00-1:00 PM |
| Thursday | One-on-one with Leader E | 7:30-8:30 AM |
| Friday | Development review and planning | 3:00-4:00 PM |

This represents 8 hours weekly—significant but manageable.

### The One-on-One Structure

Effective one-on-ones focus on development, not just status:

**First 10 Minutes**: Their agenda—what they need from you
**Next 20 Minutes**: Development focus—discussing a leadership challenge, reviewing a recent decision, or working through a skill
**Final 10 Minutes**: Accountability—progress on development goals, obstacles, support needed

Status updates should happen through other channels, reserving face time for development.

## Protecting Time Against Erosion

### Common Time Thieves

**Operational Crises**: Every organization has crises that "require" the CEO. Most don't. Developed leaders handle crises while you handle development.

**Meeting Proliferation**: Meetings expand to fill available time. Guard development time as non-negotiable.

**Urgent But Not Important**: Email, minor decisions, and small problems consume time if you let them. Delegate relentlessly.

**Development Itself**: Ironically, time spent on poorly structured development—lengthy unfocused meetings, repeated teaching of basics—steals time from effective development.

### Defense Strategies

**The Time Audit**: Track your time for two weeks. Categorize hours as:
- Development (intentional time growing leaders)
- Operational (work that developed leaders could handle)
- Strategic (work only you can do)
- Waste (time that created no value)

Most CEOs find 40%+ of their time is operational or waste—time that could fund development.

**The "Who Else" Question**: Before accepting any task, ask: "Who else could handle this?" If someone else could—even if you'd do it better—delegate it. Free time for development.

**The Calendar Fortress**: Block development time in your calendar and defend it. Treat it as you would a meeting with your most important investor or board member.

**The Delegation Discipline**: Every task you delegate to a developing leader serves double duty—it accomplishes the task and develops the leader. Prioritize delegation over personal accomplishment.

---

## Time Investment Efficiency

### High-Leverage Development Activities

Not all development time creates equal value. Prioritize:

**Teaching While Doing**: Narrate your thinking during real work. This develops while accomplishing operational goals.

**Stretch Assignments**: Create development through real responsibility. The leader develops while work gets done.

**Feedback Loops**: Quick feedback on specific behaviors creates rapid improvement. Five minutes of targeted feedback can be more valuable than an hour of general discussion.

**Group Development**: Teaching leadership concepts to multiple developing leaders simultaneously multiplies your time.

### Low-Leverage Activities to Minimize

**Repeated Basic Teaching**: If you're teaching the same concepts repeatedly, create resources (documents, videos) that teach for you.

**Solving Their Problems**: When you solve their problems, you steal development opportunity. Coach them to solve their own problems.

**Excessive Status Discussion**: Status updates don't develop leaders. Move status to written formats; use face time for development.

**Development Without Application**: Teaching concepts without creating application opportunities wastes teaching time.

## Case Study Analysis

### Case Study 1: The Time-Starved CEO

**Context**: Richard Chen was a classic overwhelmed CEO. He worked 70-hour weeks, couldn't take vacation without constant calls, and felt he had no time for "nice to have" activities like leadership development.

**The Pattern**: Richard's calendar analysis revealed 60% of his time went to decisions and problems his team should handle. He'd never invested in developing leaders who could take these responsibilities. The lack of developed leaders caused his time poverty, which prevented development investment—a vicious cycle.

**The Intervention**: Richard's coach insisted he carve out 5 hours weekly for development, despite his protests. Richard had to let some things drop while he developed leaders. The first three months were painful—some things did suffer.

**The Outcome**: By month six, Richard's developing leaders were handling problems independently. By month twelve, Richard had more discretionary time than he'd had in years. His 5-hour weekly investment had yielded 15 hours of freed time.

**The Lesson**: You cannot find time for development; you must take it, accepting short-term costs for long-term liberation.

### Case Study 2: The Protected Calendar

**Context**: CEO Amanda Okonkwo ran a fast-growing company with constant demands on her time. Everyone wanted meetings with the CEO. But Amanda had learned from a mentor: development time is non-negotiable.

**The Structure**: Amanda blocked 7:00-8:30 AM Monday through Thursday for development one-on-ones. These meetings never moved. When people requested meetings during this time, her assistant said simply: "That time is unavailable." No explanation required.

**The Results**: Amanda's four senior leaders received consistent, quality development time every week. They developed faster than peers at competitor companies. They handled more responsibility independently. Amanda's afternoon hours, freed from problems her leaders now handled, went to strategy and external relationships.

**The Lesson**: Protection requires systems, not just intention. Calendar blocks, trained assistants, and firm policies protect development time.

### Case Study 3: The Efficient Developer

**Context**: Marcus Park had limited time—he was a COO with full operational responsibility plus five leaders to develop. He had to find ways to develop efficiently.

**The Innovations**: Marcus invented several efficiency methods:
- He narrated decisions to developing leaders through brief audio messages they could listen to anytime
- He held group development sessions where leaders learned from each other's challenges
- He created a decision log that developing leaders reviewed weekly, learning from his reasoning
- He delegated development of junior leaders to his developing senior leaders

**The Outcome**: Marcus developed five strong leaders in three years while maintaining operational excellence. His efficient methods became organizational best practices. He proved that development doesn't require unlimited time—it requires smart use of limited time.

**The Lesson**: Creative approaches to development can multiply the impact of limited time. Efficiency and effectiveness can coexist.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Two-Week Time Audit

For two weeks, track every hour in one of these categories:
- **Development**: Intentional time developing leaders
- **Strategic**: Work only you can do (board relations, major decisions, external representation)
- **Operational**: Work that developed leaders could handle
- **Administrative**: Necessary but not strategic (email, routine meetings)
- **Waste**: Time that created no value

Calculate percentages. Most CEOs find development under 10% and operational over 40%—a recipe for perpetual time poverty.

### Exercise 2: The Calendar Redesign

Based on your audit, redesign your weekly calendar to:
- Block 10 hours minimum for development
- Protect strategic time
- Delegate or eliminate operational time
- Minimize administrative time

Implement the new calendar for one month, defending the blocks rigorously.

### Exercise 3: The Efficiency Experiment

Choose one development practice you currently do and find a way to make it more efficient:
- Could you develop multiple people simultaneously?
- Could you create resources that teach for you?
- Could you develop through delegation rather than separate teaching?

Implement your efficiency innovation and measure the time savings.

## Reflection Questions

1. **Time Truth**: Be honest—how much time do you currently invest in developing leaders weekly? Is it enough to create meaningful development? What would have to change to invest more?

2. **Investment Barriers**: What prevents you from investing more time in development? Operational demands? Belief that you don't have time? Discomfort with development conversations? Something else?

3. **Time Thieves**: What are the biggest consumers of your time that could be delegated to developing leaders? Why haven't you delegated them? What would it take to start?

4. **Protection Strategy**: How will you protect development time from erosion? What systems, structures, or commitments will you create?

5. **Liberation Vision**: Imagine your time three years from now if you invest heavily in development starting today. What would your calendar look like? What would you do with freed time? Is this vision compelling enough to drive investment today?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Time spent in developing leaders is time invested, not time spent. The return on that investment is the only path to sustainable growth and personal freedom." — John Maxwell

Every hour you invest in developing leaders pays compound returns. The leader you develop frees your time, extends your influence, and multiplies your impact. They will develop other leaders who develop still others—a cascading return on your original investment. The CEO who understands this invests in development even when pressured to invest elsewhere, knowing that development is not a nice-to-have luxury but the essential activity that makes everything else possible. The paradox is real: the way to have more time is to invest more time in development.
