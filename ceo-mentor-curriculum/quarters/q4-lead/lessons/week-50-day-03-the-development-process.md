# Week 50, Day 3: The Development Process

> "Growth is the great separator between those who succeed and those who do not. When I see a person beginning to separate themselves from the pack, it's almost always due to personal growth." — John Maxwell

## The Core Insight

Identifying potential leaders is only the beginning. The real work—and the real multiplication—happens through systematic development. Leadership development isn't a single event but a process that unfolds over years. It requires intentional design, patient execution, and continuous adjustment. The CEO who masters this process creates an organizational capability that competitors cannot easily replicate.

Development transforms raw potential into realized capability through the deliberate combination of instruction, experience, and reflection.

## The Four Stages of Leader Development

### Stage 1: Awareness

Before development can begin, the potential leader must become aware of the gap between where they are and where they could be.

**The Developer's Role**:
- Help them see possibilities they haven't imagined
- Provide feedback that illuminates blind spots
- Share your own development journey
- Create experiences that reveal their potential

**Signs of Readiness to Advance**:
- They acknowledge the gap without defensiveness
- They express genuine desire to grow
- They ask questions about development
- They begin seeking feedback proactively

**Common Mistakes**:
- Assuming awareness exists without creating it
- Moving to instruction before awareness is established
- Creating awareness through criticism rather than vision

### Stage 2: Instruction

Once awareness exists, the potential leader needs knowledge and frameworks for leadership.

**The Developer's Role**:
- Teach leadership principles and frameworks
- Share your own leadership philosophy
- Provide reading, courses, and learning resources
- Connect them with other leaders who can teach

**Instruction Methods**:
- **Formal**: Classes, books, workshops, certifications
- **Informal**: Conversations, mentoring sessions, shared readings
- **Vicarious**: Observing you lead, attending your meetings
- **Reflective**: Discussing leadership situations and choices

**Signs of Readiness to Advance**:
- They can articulate leadership principles
- They begin applying concepts in small ways
- They ask "what would you do" questions less frequently
- They develop their own leadership perspective

**Common Mistakes**:
- Over-relying on formal instruction
- Teaching without providing application opportunity
- Drowning them in information without prioritization

### Stage 3: Application

Knowledge becomes capability only through application. This is where most development efforts fail—leaders receive instruction but insufficient opportunity to apply it.

**The Developer's Role**:
- Create real leadership opportunities with real stakes
- Progressively increase challenge and complexity
- Provide coaching during application
- Allow mistakes while limiting catastrophic risk

**Application Progression**:
1. **Supported Application**: They lead while you observe closely
2. **Coached Application**: They lead independently with regular coaching
3. **Independent Application**: They lead with occasional check-ins
4. **Teaching Application**: They begin developing others

**Signs of Readiness to Advance**:
- They succeed in progressively difficult challenges
- They make decisions confidently and correctly
- They adapt principles to new situations
- They begin developing their own direct reports

**Common Mistakes**:
- Providing insufficient challenge (protected leadership)
- Providing overwhelming challenge (setup for failure)
- Rescuing too quickly when they struggle
- Not rescuing when failure would be catastrophic

### Stage 4: Multiplication

The ultimate goal is leaders who develop other leaders. The cycle completes when your developing leader begins developing their own leaders.

**The Developer's Role**:
- Teach them how to identify potential
- Help them understand the development process
- Observe and coach their development of others
- Celebrate their multiplication success

**Signs of Multiplication**:
- They identify and invest in their own potential leaders
- They create development systems in their areas
- Their leaders begin developing others
- They contribute to organizational leadership culture

**Common Mistakes**:
- Declaring victory before multiplication occurs
- Not explicitly teaching the development process
- Failing to measure multiplication outcomes

## The 5-Step Development Method

### Step 1: I Do, You Watch

The developing leader observes you performing leadership tasks while you narrate your thinking:
- "I'm having this conversation now because..."
- "I'm choosing this approach because..."
- "Notice how I'm framing this..."
- "I made a mistake there; here's what I should have done..."

**Purpose**: They see leadership in action and understand the reasoning behind choices.

### Step 2: I Do, You Help

The developing leader assists while you lead:
- Prepares materials you'll present
- Takes notes during meetings you run
- Handles follow-up tasks you assign
- Contributes portions of larger efforts

**Purpose**: They participate in leadership without full responsibility.

### Step 3: You Do, I Help

Responsibility shifts. They lead while you assist:
- They run the meeting; you observe and contribute
- They make the decision; you're available for questions
- They handle the conversation; you provide backup
- They own the outcome; you help with specific parts

**Purpose**: They experience full leadership responsibility with support.

### Step 4: You Do, I Watch

They lead independently while you observe:
- You attend but don't participate
- You receive reports but don't direct
- You watch outcomes without intervening
- You provide feedback after completion

**Purpose**: They prove capability while you monitor for development needs.

### Step 5: You Do, Someone Else Watches

The cycle begins again:
- They're now the developer
- They have their own person at Step 1
- You observe their development of others
- Multiplication has begun

**Purpose**: They multiply leadership through their own development of others.

## Case Study Analysis

### Case Study 1: The Rushed Development

**Context**: TechStart was growing rapidly and needed leaders fast. CEO Jennifer Park identified several promising engineers and immediately promoted them to team lead roles with a two-day leadership workshop. "They're smart; they'll figure it out," she reasoned.

**The Problem**: Without systematic development, the new leaders made predictable mistakes. They micromanaged or abdicated. They couldn't have difficult conversations. They focused on doing rather than developing. Within a year, three of five had burned out or failed.

**The Outcome**: Jennifer had to rebuild teams, hire expensive external leaders, and lost 18 months of growth. The cost of rushed development far exceeded what systematic development would have required.

**The Lesson**: Development takes time. Attempting to shortcut the process creates costly problems. Investment in systematic development pays returns that rushed promotion cannot.

### Case Study 2: The Systematic Developer

**Context**: Regional bank president Thomas Okafor inherited an organization with aging leadership and no succession pipeline. Rather than panic-hire externally, he committed to a five-year development program.

**The Development Approach**: Thomas identified 15 high-potential employees across the organization. He created a development curriculum combining formal training, rotational assignments, mentoring relationships, and action learning projects. He personally met monthly with each developing leader and their supervisor.

**The Outcome**: Over five years, 12 of 15 candidates developed into capable leaders. When senior leaders retired, qualified internal successors were ready. The organization maintained cultural continuity while bringing fresh leadership perspective. The bank's leadership pipeline became a competitive advantage.

**The Lesson**: Systematic, long-term development creates organizational capability that competitors cannot easily replicate. Patient investment in development yields compounding returns.

### Case Study 3: The Developing Developer

**Context**: Marketing director Priya Sharma had been developed by a skilled mentor and wanted to pay it forward. But she struggled to develop her own team members—her development attempts felt awkward and ineffective.

**The Learning Process**: Priya asked her mentor to teach her how to develop others. She learned to see development as a process, not an event. She practiced the five-step method. She sought feedback on her development effectiveness. She treated her own development as a developer as seriously as she'd treated her leadership development.

**The Outcome**: After two years of deliberate practice, Priya became known as an exceptional developer. Her teams consistently produced future leaders. Her methodology influenced the company's formal development program. She had learned the skill of developing others.

**The Lesson**: Developing others is itself a skill that must be developed. Leaders don't automatically know how to develop others—they must learn the process and practice it deliberately.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Development Plan

Select one high-potential person and create a comprehensive 12-month development plan:
- Assessment of current state across core competencies
- Priority areas for development (choose 2-3)
- Specific activities for each priority area
- Application opportunities you'll create
- Monthly milestones and check-ins
- Success measures at 12 months

### Exercise 2: The Five-Step Audit

For your three highest-potential leaders, assess:
- Which step are they currently at?
- How long have they been at this step?
- What would move them to the next step?
- When will you initiate that movement?

Create a 90-day action plan for advancing each through the steps.

### Exercise 3: The Narration Practice

In your next three leadership moments (meeting, decision, difficult conversation), consciously narrate your thinking to a developing leader:
- Before: What you're trying to accomplish and why
- During: What you're noticing and choosing
- After: What worked, what you'd do differently

This practice builds the "I do, you watch" capability that many leaders skip.

## Reflection Questions

1. **Process Assessment**: How systematic is your current approach to leadership development? Do you have a clear process, or is development ad hoc and reactive?

2. **Stage Awareness**: Where do your developing leaders get stuck? Do you create insufficient awareness? Provide too much instruction without application? Skip to application without instruction?

3. **Time Investment**: How much time do you personally invest in developing leaders? Is it enough to create meaningful multiplication? What would you need to change to invest more?

4. **Method Effectiveness**: Which of the 5 steps do you do well? Which do you skip or do poorly? How could you strengthen your weakest steps?

5. **Development Legacy**: If you assessed the leaders you've developed over your career, how effective has your development process been? What has worked? What hasn't? How can you improve?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care." — John Maxwell

Development is fundamentally relational. The most sophisticated development process will fail if the developing leader doesn't believe you genuinely care about their growth. They must trust that your feedback is for their benefit, not your convenience. They must believe you're invested in their success, not just the organization's success. This caring cannot be faked—it must be genuine. The best developers are those who find deep satisfaction in others' growth, who celebrate their developing leaders' achievements as their own, and who are willing to invest significant time and energy because they genuinely care about the people they're developing.

## Tomorrow's Preview

Tomorrow we explore **Time Investment**—understanding how much time leadership development actually requires and how to structure that time for maximum impact. We'll examine common time allocation mistakes and develop strategies for protecting development time against urgent but less important demands.
