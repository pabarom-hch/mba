# Week 47, Day 4: Building Influence

> "The key to becoming an effective leader is not to focus on making other people follow, but on making yourself the kind of person they want to follow." — John Maxwell

## The Core Insight

Influence isn't something that happens to you—it's something you build through deliberate action, consistent behavior, and intentional investment. Today, we explore the practical strategies for building influence: what to do, how to do it, and how to sustain it over time.

The most influential leaders don't simply have influence—they've constructed it, piece by piece, through countless interactions, decisions, and moments. They understand that influence is an architecture, not an accident. Every communication, every meeting, every decision either builds or erodes influence.

Building influence is both simple and difficult: simple because the principles are clear, difficult because the consistency required is demanding. There are no shortcuts—influence accumulated over years can be destroyed in moments, but it cannot be built in moments.

## The Foundation: Trust

All influence rests on trust. Without trust, nothing you say matters, nothing you offer is accepted, nothing you attempt succeeds. Trust is the foundation on which influence is built.

### Trust Components

**Competence Trust**: Confidence that you know what you're doing. Can you deliver results? Do you understand the domain? Is your judgment sound?

**Character Trust**: Confidence in your integrity and motives. Are you honest? Do you keep commitments? Do you act in others' interests, not just your own?

**Connection Trust**: Confidence that you understand and care about the other person. Do you listen? Do you empathize? Do you remember what matters to them?

**Consistency Trust**: Confidence based on predictable behavior over time. Can people rely on you being who you've been? Do your actions align with your stated values?

### Trust Building Practices

**Keep Small Commitments**: Trust builds through repeated experience of reliability. Keeping small commitments creates the pattern that supports trusting large ones.

**Tell the Truth, Especially When It's Difficult**: Truth-telling when it costs you builds trust faster than easy honesty. People note who tells them what they need to hear versus what they want to hear.

**Acknowledge Uncertainty and Limitation**: Admitting what you don't know builds trust in what you claim to know. Leaders who pretend omniscience erode trust with every inevitable revelation of limitation.

**Follow Through Visibly**: When you do what you said you'd do, make sure people see it. Not through announcement, but through natural visibility. Trust builds when actions match words.

**Repair Trust When Broken**: Everyone breaks trust occasionally. What matters is repair: genuine acknowledgment, sincere apology, changed behavior. Trust that's broken and repaired is often stronger than trust never tested.

## The Structure: Relationship Architecture

Influence flows through relationships. Building influence means building a network of relationships through which influence can travel.

### Relationship Investment Principles

**Invest Before You Need**: Relationships built when you need something are transactions, not relationships. Build connection before you need to draw on it.

**Invest Beyond Utility**: Relationships limited to their professional usefulness feel instrumental. Genuine interest in people beyond their organizational function creates deeper connection.

**Invest Across Hierarchy**: Influence architectures that only flow upward are fragile. Build relationships at every organizational level, in every direction.

**Invest in Quality Over Quantity**: Deep relationships with fewer people create more influence than shallow relationships with many. Prioritize connection depth over network breadth.

### Practical Relationship Building

**Listen More Than You Speak**: Listening is the most underused influence tool. When people feel heard, they become open to being influenced. When they feel talked at, they close.

**Remember What Matters**: People notice when you remember their concerns, their families, their aspirations. This attention signals genuine interest and builds connection.

**Be Available**: Accessibility creates relationship opportunity. Leaders who are always "too busy" don't build the relationships influence requires.

**Follow Up**: Initial connection doesn't create relationship—continued attention does. Follow up on conversations, check on outcomes, maintain contact.

**Share Appropriately**: Vulnerability builds connection when appropriate. Sharing your own challenges, uncertainties, and learnings invites reciprocal connection.

## The Practice: Consistent Behavior

Influence builds through patterns. Isolated positive actions create positive moments; consistent positive patterns create influence.

### High-Impact Behavior Patterns

**Decision Consistency**: Make decisions that align with stated values and principles. When people can predict how you'll decide based on your values, they develop confidence in your leadership.

**Communication Consistency**: Say the same things to different audiences. Message consistency—not spin for each audience—builds credibility as people compare notes.

**Emotional Consistency**: Regulate emotional expression so people know what to expect. Leaders whose emotions are unpredictable create anxiety that undermines influence.

**Value Consistency**: Act according to your stated values, especially when it costs you. Values-action alignment is the most powerful trust builder.

### Influence-Building Daily Habits

**Start Meetings with Connection**: Begin every meeting with genuine human connection before business content. This habit builds relationship continuously.

**End Conversations with Commitment**: Conclude every significant conversation with a clear commitment—something you'll do—and follow through. This builds reliability perception.

**Give Credit Generously**: Attribute success to others publicly and frequently. This builds loyalty and shapes how people perceive your leadership.

**Take Responsibility Clearly**: Accept responsibility for failures visibly and without excuse. This builds character trust that credit-claiming can't achieve.

**Ask for Input Genuinely**: Seek others' perspectives and visibly incorporate them. This builds respect and demonstrates that influence flows in multiple directions.

## The Amplifier: Results

Nothing builds influence like results. Achievement demonstrates competence and creates the credibility that opens doors to further influence.

### Results That Build Influence

**Visible Results**: Results no one sees build less influence than results everyone observes. Ensure your contributions are visible without self-promotion—let the work speak.

**Attributed Results**: Results that people connect to you specifically build more influence than results that seem to happen mysteriously. Connect your actions to outcomes clearly.

**Meaningful Results**: Results that matter to others build more influence than results that matter only to you. Achieve things people care about, not just things you care about.

**Consistent Results**: One-time achievements build momentary influence. Consistent delivery builds lasting credibility. Reliability in results matters more than occasional brilliance.

### Converting Results to Influence

**Narrate the Journey**: Help people understand how results were achieved. The story of achievement often matters more for influence than the achievement itself.

**Share Credit**: Include others in success stories. This creates influence not just from the result but from the appreciation of those included.

**Connect to Larger Purpose**: Frame results in terms of meaning and mission. Results that feel purposeful build more influence than results that feel arbitrary.

**Learn from Failures Publicly**: When results disappoint, visible learning builds influence through demonstrated growth. Failure hidden builds nothing; failure processed openly builds character perception.

## The Sustainer: Continuous Development

Influence maintenance requires continuous investment. Yesterday's influence investment doesn't guarantee tomorrow's influence.

### Influence Maintenance Practices

**Stay Current**: Expertise-based influence erodes as knowledge becomes outdated. Continuous learning maintains credibility.

**Stay Connected**: Relationships require ongoing investment. Relationships neglected become relationships lost.

**Stay Relevant**: As contexts change, influence sources must adapt. Yesterday's strengths may not serve tomorrow's needs.

**Stay Humble**: Success can breed arrogance that erodes influence. Maintained humility preserves connection that success might otherwise destroy.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Deliberate Builder

**Background**: Elena Vasquez was promoted to SVP of Operations with a mandate to transform how the company delivered products. She had limited relationships outside her previous function and would need to influence peers who were skeptical of operations-led change.

**The Influence-Building Campaign**: Elena approached influence-building as deliberately as she approached any operational initiative:

**Month 1-3: Foundation Building**
- Met individually with every peer to understand their concerns and aspirations
- Made small commitments and delivered on each one visibly
- Acknowledged what she didn't know about their functions

**Month 4-6: Relationship Development**
- Followed up on concerns raised in initial meetings
- Provided operational support to peers' initiatives without being asked
- Created opportunities for informal connection

**Month 7-12: Credibility Through Results**
- Delivered quick wins that benefited the whole organization
- Shared credit generously with peers who participated
- Admitted mistakes in her approach and adjusted based on feedback

**The Outcome**: By month 12, Elena had developed sufficient influence to launch her transformation initiative with genuine peer support. What could have been a power struggle became a collaborative effort—not because her position required collaboration, but because her influence made it the natural path.

**The Lesson**: Influence building can be approached as systematically as any operational challenge. Elena's deliberate, phased approach created influence that position alone couldn't have achieved.

### Case Study 2: The Influence Erosion

**Background**: James Thornton was a highly influential CEO—exceptional track record, deep relationships, strong trust. Over five years, he'd built influence that seemed unassailable.

**The Erosion Process**: Several factors converged to erode James's influence:

- His expertise became dated as the market evolved—he was still solving yesterday's problems
- His relationships narrowed as he spent more time with the board and less with the organization
- His consistency slipped—he said different things to different audiences, and people noticed
- His results, while still positive, came more from market conditions than his leadership

**The Accumulating Effects**: James didn't notice the erosion initially. His positional authority masked declining personal influence. But signals accumulated:
- Feedback became less honest
- Initiative implementation slowed
- Talented people departed
- Strategic proposals met unexpected resistance

**The Wake-Up**: A board member finally shared concerning 360 feedback: James's influence had declined significantly, even as his position remained strong. The gap between position and personal influence had grown dangerous.

**The Lesson**: Influence requires continuous maintenance. James's influence had been built deliberately but maintained accidentally. When maintenance stopped, erosion began. Influence accumulated over years can erode in months.

### Case Study 3: The Influence Multiplier

**Background**: Maria Santos understood that her individual influence, however strong, would always limit her impact. She committed to building influence not just for herself but through others.

**The Multiplication Strategy**: Maria invested heavily in developing other influential leaders:

- She mentored emerging leaders, sharing her influence-building approaches
- She created platforms for others to demonstrate their capabilities
- She celebrated and promoted others' influence development
- She built coalitions of influential leaders who supported common goals

**The Network Effect**: Over time, Maria's influence strategy created a multiplier effect:
- Her proteges became influential and remained connected to her
- Her coalition created influence that exceeded what any individual could achieve
- Her reputation for developing others attracted more talent
- Her organizational impact exceeded what her personal involvement could produce

**The Outcome**: When Maria eventually moved to a board role, her influence persisted through the network she'd built. The organization's capacity for influence had grown beyond her individual contribution.

**The Lesson**: The highest form of influence building creates influence capacity in others. Maria's legacy wasn't just her personal influence but the organizational capability for influence she'd developed.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Trust Temperature Check (25 minutes)

For each of your key relationships, assess current trust:

| Person | Competence Trust | Character Trust | Connection Trust | Consistency Trust | Overall | Building Actions Needed |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|------------------------|
| | | | | | | |

For the three relationships with lowest overall trust, identify specific actions to build it.

### Exercise 2: The Influence Building Audit (30 minutes)

Track your influence building activities over the past week:

| Day | Connection Activities | Trust Building Moments | Results Achieved | Consistency Demonstrated | Learning Investment |
|-----|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| | | | | | |

What patterns emerge? Where are you investing in influence building? Where are you neglecting it?

### Exercise 3: The Weekly Influence Ritual Design (20 minutes)

Design a weekly set of practices that build influence consistently:

**Monday**: [Specific connection action]
**Tuesday**: [Specific trust-building action]
**Wednesday**: [Specific results focus]
**Thursday**: [Specific relationship investment]
**Friday**: [Specific learning/development activity]

Commit to following this ritual for one month and tracking its effects on your influence.

## Reflection Questions

1. **Deliberateness**: How deliberate is your influence building? Is it happening by design or by accident? What would more deliberate building look like?

2. **Investment Patterns**: Where do you invest most heavily in influence building? Where do you invest least? Does this allocation match where influence would most benefit you?

3. **Consistency Reality**: How consistent are you actually? What would people say about the gap between your stated values and enacted behaviors?

4. **Maintenance Attention**: How much attention do you give to maintaining existing influence versus building new? Are you protecting what you've built?

5. **Multiplication Question**: Are you building influence only for yourself, or are you developing influence capacity in others? What's your multiplication strategy?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The respect that leadership must have requires that one's ethics be without question. A leader not only stays above the line between right and wrong, he stays well clear of the gray areas." — G. Alan Bernard (quoted by Maxwell)

**Analysis**: This quote emphasizes that influence building requires not just adequate ethics but exceptional ethics—staying "well clear of the gray areas." In influence building, perception matters as much as reality. A leader who operates in gray areas, even if technically ethical, creates doubt that erodes trust.

Building influence requires clarity that removes doubt: not just "Is this defensible?" but "Does this clearly demonstrate the character that merits influence?"

## Tomorrow's Preview

Tomorrow we'll explore **Influence Beyond Your Team**—extending influence to constituencies you don't directly lead. While much of influence building focuses on direct reports and immediate relationships, CEOs must influence boards, investors, customers, industry peers, and society. We'll examine the unique challenges and strategies for influence that extends beyond organizational boundaries.
