## The 5 Levels

**Level 1: Position** — People follow because they have to
**Level 2: Permission** — People follow because they want to
**Level 3: Production** — People follow because of what you've done
**Level 4: People Development** — People follow because of what you've done for them
**Level 5: Pinnacle** — People follow because of who you are and what you represent

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Understanding the Levels

**Reflection Prompt:**
Review the 5 levels. At what level are you operating with most people? With different groups?

**CEO Application:**
Map yourself: With direct reports, what level? With peers? With board? With industry?

### Day 2 — Level 1: Position
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Position is a poor substitute for influence."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Level 1 is where leadership begins—people follow because of your title. When do you rely on positional authority? When is that appropriate?

**CEO Application:**
Where are you stuck at Level 1 with people who should be at Level 2 or higher? What's preventing advancement?

### Day 3 — Level 2: Permission
**Morning Meditation:**
> "People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Level 2 is relationship-based. People follow because they want to, not because they have to. What relationships need investment?

**CEO Application:**
Identify relationships where you need to move from Level 1 to Level 2. What would that require?

### Day 4 — Level 3: Production
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The highest compliment a leader can receive is the one that is given by the people who work for that leader."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Level 3 is results-based. People follow because of your track record. Does your track record earn respect?

**CEO Application:**
What results do you need to achieve to advance to Level 3 with key people?

### Day 5 — Level 4: People Development
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Level 4 is where you develop others. People follow because of what you've done for them. Who have you developed?

**CEO Application:**
Name people you've significantly developed as leaders. What did you do? How can you do more?

### Day 6 — Level 5: Pinnacle
**Morning Meditation:**
> "A leader is great, not because of his or her power, but because of his or her ability to empower others."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Level 5 is rare—where your reputation precedes you and people follow because of who you are. What would it take to reach this level?

**CEO Application:**
Who in your life is a Level 5 leader? What makes them that? What can you learn?

4. **Level 4 is about reproduction.** Develop others to multiply impact.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"If you want to lead on the highest level, you must be willing to develop others."* — John Maxwell

Most CEOs operate at Level 2-3 with most people. They have relationships and results. But the multiplying effect of Level 4—developing others—is where lasting impact lives.

Assess where you are. Develop what's needed to advance. And remember: the goal isn't to be seen as a leader but to develop other leaders.
