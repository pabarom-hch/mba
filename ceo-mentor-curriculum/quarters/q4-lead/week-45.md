## Overview

Mandela served one term as president, then stepped aside. He built institutions to outlast him. He mentored successors. His legacy extends far beyond his own actions.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"There is no passion to be found playing small—in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living."* — Nelson Mandela

The CEO's ultimate responsibility is to leave the organization better than they found it—and to prepare those who come after. This requires thinking beyond your tenure.

What will remain when you're gone? Leaders you developed? Systems you built? Culture you created? Start building that now.
