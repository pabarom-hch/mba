# Week 48: The Law of Process

**Quarter:** Q4 — LEAD
**Mentor:** John Maxwell
**Theme:** Leadership develops daily, not in a day

> "Leadership develops daily, not in a day." — John Maxwell

---

## Overview

Maxwell's Law of Process: Leadership is developed over time through consistent daily investment. There are no shortcuts, no overnight leaders, no microwaved success. The leaders you admire are the result of years of daily development.

This week commits to the daily process of leadership development.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Leadership Takes Time
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Leadership develops daily, not in a day."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How long have you been developing as a leader? What has that development journey looked like? What's the trajectory?

**CEO Application:**
Draw your leadership development timeline. What were the key development periods? What caused growth?

---

### Day 2 — Daily Investment
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The secret of your success is determined by your daily agenda."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What are you doing daily to develop as a leader? Not occasionally—daily. What's your leadership development routine?

**CEO Application:**
Review your daily schedule. How much time is invested in developing your leadership capability? Is it enough?

---

### Day 3 — The Compound Effect
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Small disciplines repeated with consistency every day lead to great achievements gained slowly over time."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Leadership development compounds like money. Small daily investments become massive over years. Are you making daily deposits?

**CEO Application:**
Calculate: If you invested 15 minutes daily in leadership development for 5 years, that's 450+ hours. What would that yield?

---

### Day 4 — Learning from Experience
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Experience is not the best teacher. Evaluated experience is."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Experience without reflection doesn't develop leadership. How do you evaluate your experiences to extract learning?

**CEO Application:**
Establish a reflection practice: Daily or weekly review of leadership experiences. What happened? What did you learn?

---

### Day 5 — Phases of Leadership Development
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Growth is the great separator between those who succeed and those who do not."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Maxwell identifies phases: I don't know what I don't know → I know what I don't know → I grow and know, and it starts to show → I simply go because of what I know. Where are you?

**CEO Application:**
In different leadership areas, you're at different phases. Map yourself. Where do you need to move to the next phase?

---

### Day 6 — The Long Game of Development
**Morning Meditation:**
> "There are no shortcuts in life—only those we imagine."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Leadership development is a lifetime pursuit. Where do you want to be as a leader in 10 years? 20 years?

**CEO Application:**
Set a 10-year leadership development vision. What kind of leader do you want to become? What will it take?

---

**Review Questions:**
1. What is your current daily leadership development practice?
2. How are you reflecting on and learning from experience?
3. Where are you in different phases of development?

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"Champions don't become champions in the ring—they are merely recognized there."* — John Maxwell

The CEO you see leading confidently is the product of years of daily development. The decisions that look easy are the result of countless hours of learning, failing, and growing.

Commit to the daily process. There's no shortcut, but there's also a guarantee: consistent daily investment will make you a better leader over time.
