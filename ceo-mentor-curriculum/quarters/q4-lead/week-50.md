## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"A leader's lasting value is measured by succession."* — John Maxwell

The CEO's ultimate contribution is not what they build but the leaders they develop. Long after your strategy is outdated, the leaders you developed will be building the future.

Make leadership development a priority, not an afterthought. Identify potential, invest time, use a process, and measure by reproduction. Your legacy depends on it.
