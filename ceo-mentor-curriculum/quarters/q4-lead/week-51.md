## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"When the leader gets better, everyone gets better."* — John Maxwell

The 21 Laws are not theoretical—they're diagnostic and developmental tools. Use them to assess where you are, identify where you need to grow, and guide your daily leadership practice.

No one is strong in all 21 laws. But awareness of the laws helps you see gaps and deliberately address them.
