# Week 47: The Law of Influence

**Quarter:** Q4 — LEAD
**Mentor:** John Maxwell
**Theme:** True leadership is influence, nothing more, nothing less

> "Leadership is influence—nothing more, nothing less." — John Maxwell

## Overview

Maxwell's core definition: Leadership is influence. Not title, not position, not authority—influence. If you're not influencing others, you're not leading, regardless of your position. If you are influencing others, you're leading, regardless of your title.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"He who thinks he leads, but has no followers, is only taking a walk."* — John Maxwell

The CEO has positional authority. But the best CEOs don't rely on it. They build influence so strong that people would follow them without the title.

When you operate from influence rather than authority, you get discretionary effort. People go beyond compliance to commitment. That's the difference between an organization that functions and one that excels.
