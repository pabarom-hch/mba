# Week 8: Owner Mentality

**Quarter:** Q1 — THINK
**Mentor:** Warren Buffett
**Theme:** Thinking like an owner, not a renter

> "We do not view the company itself as the ultimate owner of our business assets but, instead, view the company as a conduit through which our shareholders own assets." — Warren Buffett

---

## Overview

Buffett distinguishes between owners and renters. Owners care about long-term health; renters extract short-term value. Owners invest in maintenance; renters defer it. Owners think about the next generation; renters think about their exit.

This week cultivates owner mentality—thinking about your organization as if you personally owned 100% and would never sell.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — The Owner vs. Renter Distinction
**Morning Meditation:**

### Day 3 — Capital Allocation as Owner Responsibility
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The heads of many companies are not skilled in capital allocation. Their inadequacy is not surprising."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How thoughtfully do you allocate capital (money, time, attention)? Do you treat every dollar as if it came from your own pocket?

**CEO Application:**
Review one significant expenditure through owner eyes. Would you spend this money if it were your personal wealth?

### Day 4 — Maintaining the Asset
**Morning Meditation:**
> "After 10 years on the job, a CEO who deals with capital allocation has made decisions that affect the deployment of 100% of the company's capital."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What assets (physical, human, intellectual, reputational) are you maintaining? What assets are you allowing to depreciate through neglect?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one asset that's been neglected. Create a maintenance plan. Owners maintain; renters deplete.

### Day 5 — Honest Reporting
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Managers thinking about accounting issues should ask: How would I account for this if I were the sole owner?"

**Reflection Prompt:**
How honestly do you report results—to yourself, your board, your team? Where might you be putting spin on reality?

**CEO Application:**
Draft a report on your organization's status that you'd want to receive if you were an absentee owner who valued candor above comfort.

### Day 6 — Thinking About Successors
**Morning Meditation:**
> "When a manager wants to acquire a company, he should think about one thing: 'Would I want to own this company if there was no stock market?'"

**Reflection Prompt:**
If you left tomorrow, what condition would you leave the organization in? Would your successor thank you or curse you?

**CEO Application:**
List three things you're doing that a future CEO will appreciate. List three things you're deferring that a future CEO will have to fix.

### The Owner Audit

**Part 1: Owner Behaviors**
Rate yourself (1-10) on these owner behaviors:

| Behavior | Rating | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| I treat company money like my own | | |
| I maintain assets rather than depleting them | | |
| I think beyond my tenure | | |
| I report honestly, even when uncomfortable | | |
| I align my incentives with long-term value | | |
| I invest in things that won't pay off until later | | |
| I build systems that will outlast me | | |

**Part 2: Renter Behaviors**
Be honest—where do you show renter behaviors?

- Deferring necessary maintenance:
- Optimizing for appearance over substance:
- Extracting rather than building:
- Thinking about exit over improvement:

**Part 3: Ownership Commitment**
What one change would most shift you toward owner behavior?

What's preventing that change?

What will you do about it this week?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Owners and renters decide differently.** Know which you're being in each moment.

2. **Skin in the game aligns interests.** Design your incentives to create genuine ownership mentality.

3. **Capital allocation is the owner's job.** Every dollar deployed is a decision. Make it consciously.

4. **Owners maintain.** Deferred maintenance is borrowing from the future.

5. **Honest reporting serves owners.** Spin and spin-off eventually catch up.

## The Owner Test

For any significant decision, ask:
- Would I make this decision if I owned 100% of the company?
- Would I make this decision if I could never sell?
- Am I building or depleting?
- Would I want to receive this as an inheritance?
- Am I behaving like an owner or a renter?

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats."* — Warren Buffett

The owner-manager is the ideal. When ownership and management are separated, interests diverge. As CEO, your job is to think and act like an owner, even if you're not.

This means treating capital as sacred, maintaining assets carefully, reporting honestly, and building for the long term. It means making decisions you'd be comfortable with if you were on the other side of the table.
