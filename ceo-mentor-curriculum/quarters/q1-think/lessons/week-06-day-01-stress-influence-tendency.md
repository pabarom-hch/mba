# Day 1: Stress-Influence Tendency

**Week 6 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger**

> "Light stress can slightly improve performance. Heavy stress causes dysfunction."

---

## The Core Insight

Stress changes how we think. Light stress can sharpen focus and improve performance. But heavy stress degrades judgment, narrows attention, and pushes us toward familiar—often suboptimal—responses.

**The Stress-Influence Tendency** causes us to:
- Revert to habitual patterns under pressure
- Make hasty decisions to reduce stressful uncertainty
- Lose access to nuanced, creative thinking
- Underestimate how impaired we are

For CEOs who face constant pressure, understanding this bias is essential.

## The Stress Performance Curve

### The Yerkes-Dodson Law

Performance and stress follow an inverted U:

- **Low stress:** Insufficient arousal, suboptimal performance
- **Moderate stress:** Optimal alertness, peak performance
- **High stress:** Impaired cognition, degraded performance

**The CEO challenge:** Heavy responsibility means chronic moderate-to-high stress. Without management, you're often making decisions in the impaired zone.

### What Changes Under High Stress

**Attention narrows:**
- Tunnel vision on immediate threats
- Peripheral information ignored
- Long-term considerations fade

**Memory degrades:**
- Working memory capacity drops
- Recall becomes unreliable
- Learning is impaired

**Decision quality suffers:**
- Risk assessment distorted
- Habitual responses dominate
- Creative options invisible

## How Stress Affects CEO Decisions

### Pattern 1: The Hasty Resolution

Under stress, we want the uncertainty to end. This triggers doubt-avoidance—rushing to decisions to escape stressful ambiguity.

**The pattern:**
1. Stressful situation arises
2. Multiple options exist
3. Rather than deliberate, we grab the first reasonable option
4. Stress reduces (temporarily)
5. Decision is often suboptimal

### Pattern 2: The Familiar Fallback

When stressed, we revert to what we know—even if it doesn't fit the situation.

**The pattern:**
1. Novel challenge emerges
2. Stress rises
3. Rather than develop novel response, we apply old patterns
4. "When in doubt, do what you've always done"
5. Old solution often doesn't fit new problem

### Pattern 3: The Emotional Cascade

Stress amplifies emotional responses. Small frustrations become rage. Minor concerns become anxiety spirals.

**The pattern:**
1. Stressor occurs
2. Emotional reaction is disproportionate
3. Emotional reaction becomes new stressor
4. Cascade continues
5. Judgment severely impaired by the time decisions are made

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Crisis Decision

A company faced a sudden competitive threat. The CEO, under intense stress, made immediate strategic decisions in a weekend session.

**What happened:** Decisions made under pressure were reactive, based on familiar playbooks that didn't fit the situation. A year later, most were reversed.

**The lesson:** Crisis doesn't eliminate the need for deliberation—it increases it. But stress pushes toward the opposite.

### Case 2: The Deal Under Pressure

A CEO was negotiating a critical deal with a tight deadline. As the deadline approached, stress mounted. She made concessions she later regretted.

**What happened:** The need to resolve stressful uncertainty led to giving away more than necessary. The other party, less stressed, extracted value.

**The lesson:** Manufactured deadlines exploit stress. The less stressed party often wins.

### Case 3: The Emotional Overreaction

A CEO received unexpectedly negative quarterly results during an already stressful period. He called an emergency leadership meeting and made pointed criticisms of several team members.

**What happened:** The emotional cascade damaged relationships. Team members became defensive and filtered future bad news. The original problem got worse.

**The lesson:** Stress amplifies emotional reactions. Actions taken in that state often compound problems.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Know Your Stress Signals

Identify how stress manifests for you:

**Physical signals:**
- Tension (where in body?)
- Sleep disruption
- Appetite changes
- Energy fluctuations

**Behavioral signals:**
- Short temper
- Rushed speech
- Decision urgency
- Avoidance behaviors

**Cognitive signals:**
- Racing thoughts
- Difficulty focusing
- Negative thought patterns
- Catastrophizing

**Practice:** When you notice these signals, flag your judgment as potentially impaired.

### Application 2: The Decision Delay Rule

Create a personal rule: No significant decisions when stress is elevated.

**Implementation:**
- Recognize the stress state
- Acknowledge the urge to decide
- Set a specific review time (24-48 hours)
- Create conditions for better deliberation
- Revisit when calmer

**Exception protocol:** True emergencies require immediate action. But question whether it's truly an emergency or manufactured urgency.

### Application 3: Stress Management Practices

Reduce chronic stress load so acute stressors are manageable:

**Regular practices:**
- Physical exercise (proven stress reducer)
- Sleep protection (sleep deprivation amplifies stress)
- Recovery time (sustainable performance)
- Mindfulness or meditation (reduces reactivity)

**Crisis practices:**
- Step away before responding
- Physical movement (clears stress hormones)
- Trusted advisors (external perspective)
- Written processing (clarifies thinking)

### Application 4: Stress-Aware Decision Processes

Design processes that compensate for stress effects:

**For crisis decisions:**
- Required cooling-off periods
- Mandatory input from others
- Written rationale requirements
- Pre-committed decision criteria

**For high-stakes situations:**
- Stress-level assessment before deciding
- Delegation when impairment is high
- Post-decision review when calm
- Learning capture for future

---

## The Stress Paradox

**The paradox:** When you most need good judgment (high-stakes situations), you're most likely to be stressed and therefore impaired.

**The resolution:** Build systems that protect against impairment. Don't rely on stressed-you to overcome stress.

**Practical example:**
- Pre-commit to decision processes before stress hits
- Delegate decisions to less-stressed parties when appropriate
- Build in forced delays
- Have advisors with lower stress stakes

---

## Stress and Other Biases

Stress amplifies other biases:

**Stress + Doubt-Avoidance:**
Already prone to rush judgment; stress accelerates it dramatically.

**Stress + Social Proof:**
Under stress, following the crowd feels safer than independent thinking.

**Stress + Authority:**
Stressed people defer more to authority figures.

**Stress + Loss Aversion:**
Fear of loss intensifies under stress; we become more risk-averse in loss frames.

## Building Stress Resilience

### Personal Resilience

**Foundation:**
- Physical health (exercise, sleep, nutrition)
- Psychological practices (mindfulness, therapy, reflection)
- Relationships (support network)
- Purpose (meaning beyond immediate pressures)

**Capacity expansion:**
- Exposure to manageable stressors builds tolerance
- Recovery after stress builds capacity
- Self-compassion reduces stress amplification

### Organizational Resilience

**Culture:**
- Normalize stress acknowledgment
- Discourage macho "stress is for the weak" attitudes
- Create recovery expectations
- Model healthy stress management

**Systems:**
- Decision processes with built-in delays
- Escalation paths that don't create unnecessary urgency
- Workload management
- Support resources available

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Stress Inventory

Map your current stress landscape:

| Stressor | Intensity (1-10) | Duration | Controllable? | Action |
|----------|-----------------|----------|---------------|--------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

What's your total stress load? Are you in the impaired zone?

### Exercise 2: The Signal Recognition

This week, notice when stress signals appear:

| Day | Signal | Trigger | What I Did | What I Should Have Done |
|-----|--------|---------|------------|------------------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

### Exercise 3: The Decision Audit

Review recent decisions made under high stress:
1. What was the stress level?
2. How might it have affected the decision?
3. Would you decide differently now?
4. What could have protected you?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. How do you behave under heavy stress? What are your telltale signs?

2. What decisions have you made while stressed that you later regretted?

3. What's your current chronic stress level? How might it be affecting daily judgment?

4. What systems could you build to protect decisions from stress influence?

5. Who can you rely on to provide perspective when you're in a stressed state?
