# Day 6: Teaching Long-Term Thinking

**Week 7 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

> "We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful."

## The Core Insight

Long-term thinking only works if it extends beyond you. If you think long-term but your organization thinks short-term, you'll be in constant conflict. Teaching long-term thinking—and aligning systems to support it—is essential for sustained success.

This requires both communication and structural alignment.

## The Communication Challenge

### Why Long-Term Thinking Is Hard to Teach

**The visibility problem:**
Long-term results are invisible now. Short-term results are visible. People optimize for what they can see.

**The reward problem:**
Most reward systems emphasize short-term results. Annual bonuses, quarterly reviews, and performance metrics all focus on the near term.

**The credibility problem:**
"Think long-term" sounds like code for "tolerate poor performance." People are skeptical until they see it modeled.

**The patience problem:**
Long-term thinking requires tolerating short-term discomfort. Most people find this difficult.

## Buffett's Communication Approach

### The Annual Letter

Buffett's shareholder letters teach long-term thinking explicitly:
- Explain philosophy repeatedly
- Show how long-term orientation affects decisions
- Admit mistakes and what they learned
- Connect short-term actions to long-term strategy

**The key:** Consistent messaging over decades builds understanding and trust.

### Explicit Expectations

Buffett sets expectations clearly:
- No quarterly guidance
- Performance measured over years, not quarters
- Explanation of what to expect short-term
- Clear articulation of time horizons

**The key:** Managing expectations reduces short-term pressure.

### Owner Mentality

Buffett treats shareholders as owners, not traders:
- Writes as if speaking to family members who are co-owners
- Explains decisions as he would to partners
- Builds relationship over time

**The key:** Treating stakeholders as long-term partners creates alignment.

## Communicating Long-Term Thinking

### To Your Team

**Repeated messaging:**
- Articulate long-term vision regularly
- Connect daily work to long-term goals
- Celebrate long-term investments
- Tell stories of patience paying off

**Visible modeling:**
- Make long-term decisions publicly
- Explain your reasoning
- Show consistency between words and actions
- Admit when short-term pressure affects you

**Permission giving:**
- "It's okay if this doesn't pay off immediately"
- "We're investing for the future"
- "Short-term sacrifice for long-term gain is acceptable"

### To Your Board

**Set expectations:**
- Be clear about time horizons
- Explain trade-offs between short and long-term
- Agree on how performance will be measured
- Build in patience for long-term investments

**Educate continuously:**
- Share thinking behind decisions
- Provide context for short-term results
- Connect current performance to long-term strategy
- Review previous long-term bets and their outcomes

### To Investors/Stakeholders

**Attract the right ones:**
- Be clear about your orientation
- Discourage short-term focused stakeholders
- Build relationships with long-term oriented partners
- Accept that some won't align

**Manage expectations:**
- Be honest about trade-offs
- Explain what to expect short-term
- Provide context for results
- Build credibility through consistency

## Aligning Systems with Long-Term Thinking

### Compensation and Incentives

**The problem:** Most compensation is short-term focused:
- Annual bonuses based on annual results
- Quarterly targets driving quarterly behavior
- Stock options with short vesting periods

**Better alignment:**
- Multi-year performance periods
- Clawback provisions for short-term gains that reverse
- Equity with long vesting
- Metrics that include long-term indicators

**Questions to ask:**
- What time horizon do our incentives actually encourage?
- What would change if bonuses were based on 3-year results?
- How do we reward long-term investments that haven't paid off yet?

### Performance Evaluation

**The problem:** Reviews focus on recent performance:
- What did you accomplish this quarter/year?
- Visible results emphasized
- Long-term investments underweighted

**Better alignment:**
- Include "long-term investment" criteria
- Evaluate judgment, not just outcomes
- Track predictions over time
- Review past long-term decisions

### Planning and Budgeting

**The problem:** Annual budgets drive annual thinking:
- Everything evaluated year-by-year
- Long-term investments compete with short-term needs
- Rolling over unchanged doesn't require justification

**Better alignment:**
- Multi-year investment categories
- Protected budgets for long-term initiatives
- Regular review of long-term investments
- Zero-based evaluation of legacy commitments

### Decision Processes

**The problem:** Most decisions are made without long-term frame:
- Immediate considerations dominate
- Long-term implications afterthought
- No systematic long-term check

**Better alignment:**
- Required long-term impact assessment for major decisions
- "30-year lens" question in decision frameworks
- Devil's advocate for short-term bias
- Documentation of long-term reasoning

## Building a Long-Term Culture

### Hiring for Long-Term Orientation

**Interview signals:**
- Do they think about the long term unprompted?
- How do they talk about past long-term investments?
- What's their personal investment horizon?
- How do they handle short-term pressure?

**Screen out:**
- Short-term focus in how they describe past work
- Impatience with results
- Obsession with immediate metrics
- Lack of long-term planning

### Promoting Long-Term Thinkers

**Reward signals:**
- People who made long-term investments that paid off
- People who resisted short-term pressure appropriately
- People who think about consequences beyond their tenure
- People who build for others to inherit

**Avoid promoting:**
- Short-term heroes who left messes
- Those who extracted rather than invested
- Those who optimized their period at expense of future

### Celebrating Long-Term Wins

**Make visible:**
- Investments from years ago that are now paying off
- Decisions that looked bad short-term but worked long-term
- People who built things that outlasted them
- Patience that created value

**Tell the stories:**
- "Remember when we invested in X five years ago? Here's what happened."
- "This person made a bet that took years to pay off—and it did."
- "We resisted short-term pressure then. Here's why that was right."

This famous quote captures long-term thinking in action: acting differently from the crowd, when the crowd is short-term oriented. Teaching your organization to do this is one of your most important jobs.
