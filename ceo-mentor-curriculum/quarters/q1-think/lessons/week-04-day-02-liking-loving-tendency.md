## The Core Insight

Humans are wired to like and love. This is beautiful for relationships and communities. It's dangerous for decision-making.

**The Liking/Loving Tendency** causes us to:
- Distort facts to favor people and things we like
- Ignore or minimize faults in those we love
- Comply with wishes of people we like
- Favor ideas, products, and proposals associated with liked people

This bias operates constantly and unconsciously, shaping decisions we believe are objective.

## The Mechanisms of Liking Bias

### Mechanism 1: Fault Blindness

When we like someone, we literally become less able to see their flaws. The brain filters information to maintain positive feelings.

**In business:**
- Overlooking performance issues in favored employees
- Missing warning signs in partnerships we're excited about
- Not seeing problems with products we've fallen in love with

### Mechanism 2: Undue Compliance

We're more likely to comply with requests from people we like—often without adequate scrutiny.

**In business:**
- Approving projects from likable presenters
- Saying yes to deals from friendly partners
- Going along with strategy from charismatic leaders

### Mechanism 3: The Halo Effect

Positive feelings in one domain spill over into unrelated domains. If someone is likable, we assume they're also competent, honest, and correct.

**In business:**
- Charismatic founders assumed to be good operators
- Friendly executives assumed to be strategic
- Likable candidates assumed to be qualified

### Mechanism 4: Association

We extend liking to things associated with liked people—their ideas, their choices, their products.

**In business:**
- Product proposals favored because of who proposed them
- Strategies favored because admired competitors use them
- Technologies favored because liked colleagues advocate for them

## Why This Bias Is Particularly Dangerous

### Reason 1: It Feels Like Objectivity

Unlike obvious biases, liking bias feels like sound judgment. "I like them because they're good" seems logical, even when causation runs the other way.

### Reason 2: It's Socially Reinforced

Favoring people we like is considered good leadership—being loyal, supportive, trusting. The bias hides behind virtue.

### Reason 3: It Compounds

Once we like someone, we favor their work. That creates positive experiences, increasing liking further. The bias self-reinforces.

### Reason 4: It's Hard to Challenge

Suggesting that someone's judgment is impaired by liking is difficult. "You're only saying that because you like them" is rarely received well.

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Trusted Lieutenant

A CEO deeply liked and trusted his COO. When problems emerged in operations, the CEO attributed them to market conditions, not leadership. When others raised concerns, he dismissed them as jealousy.

**The result:** Problems compounded for two years before becoming undeniable. By then, the damage was severe and the COO had to be replaced.

**The lesson:** Liking created fault blindness, extending damage far beyond what objective assessment would have allowed.

### Case 2: The Charismatic Founder

Investors loved a charismatic startup founder. His charm created a halo effect—they assumed operational excellence matched his presentation skills.

**The result:** Poor operations, covered by charm, eventually collapsed. Investors hadn't done adequate diligence; they were seduced by likability.

**The lesson:** Charisma and competence are independent variables. Liking conflates them.

### Case 3: The Popular Proposal

Two strategic proposals were presented to the leadership team. One came from a popular, well-liked executive. One came from a competent but socially awkward manager.

**The result:** The team favored the popular executive's proposal, though objective analysis would have favored the other. Association with a liked person created preference.

**The lesson:** Ideas take on the coloring of their advocates.

## How Liking Is Manipulated

Understanding this bias also means recognizing when it's being weaponized.

### Manipulation 1: Ingratiation

Flattery and likability can be strategically deployed to gain favorable decisions.

**Watch for:** People who invest heavily in making you like them before asking for things.

### Manipulation 2: Similarity

We like people similar to us. Skilled influencers find and emphasize similarities.

**Watch for:** Meetings where someone emphasizes how much you have in common before the ask.

### Manipulation 3: Association

Connecting proposals with people or things you already like.

**Watch for:** "This is just like what [admired company/person] does..."

### Manipulation 4: Compliments

Sincere-seeming praise creates liking, which creates favorable evaluation.

**Watch for:** Compliments that seem designed to create reciprocal positivity.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Separate Message from Messenger

For every proposal or piece of information, consciously ask:

- "Would I evaluate this differently if it came from someone I didn't like?"
- "Would I evaluate this differently if it came from someone I liked more?"

**Practice:** Before major decisions, imagine the same proposal coming from different people. Does your evaluation change?

### Application 2: Structured Evaluation

Use formal evaluation criteria that reduce the influence of liking.

**Examples:**
- Scoring rubrics for candidates and proposals
- Blind evaluation where possible
- Devil's advocate roles assigned formally
- Written criteria established before evaluation

### Application 3: Seek Disconfirmation for Liked Ideas

When you find yourself favoring something, actively seek problems:

- "What's wrong with this?"
- "Why might this fail?"
- "Who disagrees, and why?"

The more you like something, the harder you should look for flaws.

### Application 4: Watch Your Hiring and Promotion Patterns

People tend to favor those similar to themselves (which creates liking).

**Audit:** Are your hires and promotions disproportionately similar to you? This might indicate liking bias rather than objective assessment.

---

## The Flip Side: Strategic Likability

Understanding this bias also means you can use it ethically.

**For yourself:**
- Being likable creates business advantage
- But don't confuse being liked with being right
- Don't confuse others liking you with objective agreement

**For your organization:**
- Hire for likability when it matters (sales, customer success)
- But ensure objective measures complement it
- Don't let likability substitute for competence

## Interacting with Yesterday's Lesson

Liking and incentives compound.

**The pattern:**
- You like an advisor
- They have incentives misaligned with your interests
- Liking makes you trust their incentivized advice
- You make decisions that serve their interests, not yours

**Protection:** When you like someone who advises you, be *extra* vigilant about their incentives.

## Distinguishing Good Relationships from Bias

Not all positive feelings are bias. Good relationships and trust are valuable.

**The distinction:**
- Healthy trust: "I like them AND I verify their work"
- Bias: "I like them, SO I trust their work"

**The check:**
- Do you apply the same scrutiny to liked people's work?
- Do you have objective measures beyond your feelings?
- Can you articulate why their work is good, independent of liking them?

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Liking Inventory

List five people you like most at work. For each:
1. What work of theirs have you approved or supported?
2. How rigorous was your evaluation?
3. Would a disliked person's work receive the same treatment?

### Exercise 2: The Proposal Test

Next time you're evaluating a proposal from someone you like:
1. Write your evaluation
2. Imagine the same proposal from someone neutral or disliked
3. Would your evaluation change?
4. What does that tell you?

### Exercise 3: The Criticism Practice

Identify someone you like whose work might deserve critique. Practice articulating the criticism—first privately, then see if you can deliver it appropriately.

## Reflection Questions

1. Who do you like most on your team? Is your evaluation of their work objective or biased?

2. When did liking someone lead you to overlook problems that later became obvious?

3. How do you separate your feelings about people from your evaluation of their work?

4. Who might be using likability to influence your decisions?

5. What would change if you applied equal scrutiny to everyone's work, regardless of how you felt about them?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool." — Richard Feynman

When you like someone, you fool yourself most easily. Your judgment feels sound precisely when it's most distorted.

## Tomorrow's Preview

**Day 3** explores the opposite bias: **Disliking/Hating Tendency**—how negative feelings distort judgment in the other direction, causing us to dismiss valid ideas and overlook virtues.
