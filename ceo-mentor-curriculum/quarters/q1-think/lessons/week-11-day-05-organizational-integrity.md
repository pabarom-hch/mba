# Day 5: Organizational Integrity

**Week 11 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

> "In looking for someone to hire, look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if they don't have the first, the other two will kill you."

---

## The Core Insight

Individual integrity isn't enough. Organizations need structural integrity—systems, incentives, and culture that make ethical behavior the natural choice and unethical behavior difficult and costly.

Buffett's warning about hiring is also organizational: an intelligent, energetic organization without integrity will be intelligently and energetically destructive. The CEO's job is to build integrity into the organizational fabric.

## The Three Levels of Organizational Integrity

### Level 1: Individual Integrity

**What it means:**
- Hiring people with integrity
- Supporting individual ethical choices
- Removing those who lack integrity

**The limitation:**
- Individuals face pressure
- Good people can make bad choices
- One bad actor can corrupt others

### Level 2: Systemic Integrity

**What it means:**
- Incentives that reward ethical behavior
- Processes that prevent unethical choices
- Controls that catch problems early

**The benefit:**
- Reduces pressure on individuals
- Makes right behavior easier
- Catches problems before they grow

### Level 3: Cultural Integrity

**What it means:**
- Shared values around integrity
- Peer pressure toward ethical behavior
- Stories and heroes that reinforce integrity

**The benefit:**
- Self-policing culture
- Integrity becomes "how we do things"
- Sustainable without constant enforcement

## Building Integrity into Hiring

### The Buffett Filter

**Hierarchy of hiring criteria:**
1. Integrity (non-negotiable)
2. Intelligence (important)
3. Energy (important)

**The logic:** Intelligence and energy are multipliers. They multiply integrity... or its absence.

### Assessing Integrity in Hiring

**Reference checks:**
- Ask specifically about integrity
- Listen for hesitation
- Probe edge cases
- Check multiple sources

**Behavioral questions:**
- Describe a time you faced an ethical dilemma
- Tell me about a time you raised a concern
- What would you do if your boss asked you to do something questionable?
- When have you given up something for integrity?

**Red flags:**
- Rationalizing past questionable behavior
- Blaming others for ethical failures
- Inability to describe integrity choices
- Dismissing ethics as "naive"

### The Non-Negotiable Standard

**Be willing to:**
- Reject talented candidates who lack integrity
- Accept less "brilliant" candidates with strong integrity
- Pay the short-term cost of passing on talent
- Trust that integrity compounds

---

## Building Integrity into Systems

### Incentive Design

**Good incentives:**
- Reward long-term value, not just short-term results
- Include integrity metrics
- Avoid creating pressure to cut corners
- Align personal success with organizational integrity

**Bad incentives:**
- Extreme performance pressure
- Short-term-only measurement
- Individual competition over collaboration
- Metrics that can be gamed

**The test:** Do our incentives make ethical behavior harder or easier?

### Process Design

**Good processes:**
- Multiple checkpoints for significant decisions
- Separation of duties for critical functions
- Transparent decision trails
- Easy escalation of concerns

**Bad processes:**
- Single points of control for high-risk areas
- No oversight on critical functions
- Decisions without documentation
- Difficult to raise concerns

**The test:** Do our processes assume good intentions while protecting against bad ones?

### Control Design

**Good controls:**
- Regular audits of high-risk areas
- Anonymous reporting channels
- Swift investigation of concerns
- Visible consequences for violations

**Bad controls:**
- No independent verification
- No safe way to report
- Concerns ignored or buried
- Violations without consequence

**The test:** Would we catch problems early, and would we hear about them?

## Building Integrity into Culture

### The Tone at the Top

**What leaders must do:**
- Model integrity visibly
- Discuss ethical dimensions of decisions
- Admit their own mistakes
- Support those who raise concerns
- Enforce consequences for violations

**What leaders must not do:**
- Rationalize questionable behavior
- Punish messengers
- Tolerate high performers with low integrity
- Let violations slide
- Separate stated values from actual behavior

### The Stories We Tell

**Integrity-building stories:**
- The time we lost money doing the right thing
- The person who raised a concern that saved us
- The deal we walked away from for ethical reasons
- The leader who admitted a mistake

**Integrity-eroding stories:**
- The clever workaround that made us money
- The person who was ignored when they raised concerns
- The leader whose violations were tolerated
- The values statement that everyone knows is fiction

### The Peer Pressure

**In healthy cultures:**
- Peers reinforce ethical behavior
- Cutting corners is socially costly
- Raising concerns is supported
- Integrity is admired

**In unhealthy cultures:**
- Peers reinforce corner-cutting
- Ethical behavior is mocked as naive
- Raising concerns is dangerous
- Integrity is seen as career-limiting

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Enron — The Organizational Integrity Failure

Enron's collapse was organizational, not just individual:

**System failures:**
- Incentives rewarded deal-making regardless of reality
- Controls were overridden by top leadership
- Auditors were compromised

**Culture failures:**
- Arrogance celebrated
- Ethics mocked as weakness
- Ends justified means
- Dissenters silenced

**The lesson:** Individual bad actors couldn't have succeeded without system and culture failures.

### Case 2: Johnson & Johnson's Credo-Based Culture

J&J's Tylenol crisis response was enabled by culture:

**The foundation:**
- Credo stating customer safety comes first
- Decades of reinforcement
- Stories of credo-based decisions
- Leaders who believed it

**The response:**
- Immediate recall (not cost-benefit analysis)
- Customer safety first (as credo stated)
- Transparency throughout

**The lesson:** Culture made the right decision natural, not heroic.

### Case 3: Wells Fargo — When Systems Override Culture

Wells Fargo had ethics statements but:

**System failures:**
- Extreme sales pressure
- Individual accountability for impossible targets
- Punishment for missing goals
- No effective escalation path

**Culture failures:**
- Pressure normalized
- Concerns dismissed
- "Just get it done" mentality
- Integrity rhetoric without integrity support

**The lesson:** Systems that create pressure will override stated culture.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "In looking for someone to hire, look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if they don't have the first, the other two will kill you."

This applies to organizations too. An intelligent, energetic organization without integrity is destructive. Build integrity into your systems, not just your statements.
