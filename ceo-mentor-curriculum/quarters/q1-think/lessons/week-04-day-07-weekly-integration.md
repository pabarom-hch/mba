# Day 7: Weekly Integration — The Psychology of Misjudgment, Part 1

**Week 4 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger**

> "The psychology of misjudgment is a terribly important thing to learn."

## The Week in Review

This week introduced the first eight of Munger's 25 standard causes of human misjudgment—cognitive biases that affect every decision you make.

| Day | Bias | Core Concept |
|-----|------|--------------|
| 1 | Reward and Punishment Super-Response | Behavior follows incentives with remarkable intensity |
| 2 | Liking/Loving Tendency | We distort reality to favor those we like |
| 3 | Disliking/Hating Tendency | We distort reality to disfavor those we dislike |
| 4 | Doubt-Avoidance Tendency | We rush to conclusions to eliminate uncertainty |
| 5 | Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency | We resist changing our minds once committed |
| 6a | Curiosity Tendency | We naturally seek understanding |
| 6b | Kantian Fairness Tendency | We expect reciprocal fair treatment |
| 6c | Envy/Jealousy Tendency | We suffer at others' success |

## The Complete Framework: First Eight Biases

### The Incentive Master Bias

**Reward and Punishment Super-Response** stands above the others in Munger's view. Get incentives right, and much else follows. Get them wrong, and no amount of training, values, or intention can save you.

**Application:** Before analyzing any behavior problem, first ask: "What are the incentives?"

### The Emotional Distortion Biases

**Liking/Loving** and **Disliking/Hating** are two sides of one phenomenon: our emotions distort our judgment. We see what we want to see about people and ideas we have feelings about.

**Application:** Separate the message from the messenger. Evaluate ideas independent of source.

### The Commitment Biases

**Doubt-Avoidance** rushes us to conclusions. **Inconsistency-Avoidance** locks us there. Together, they create the common pattern: quick to commit, slow to update.

**Application:** Delay judgment. Stay open. Update when evidence warrants.

### The Social Comparison Biases

**Fairness** and **Envy** reflect our constant social comparison. We measure ourselves against others, expect fair treatment, and suffer when others have what we want.

**Application:** Define your own success metrics. Play your own game. Build fair systems.

### The Beneficial Bias

**Curiosity** is mostly positive—our drive to understand powers learning and innovation.

**Application:** Harness and direct curiosity. Don't suppress it, but channel it strategically.

## How These Biases Interact

### The Incentive Amplifier

Incentives interact with every other bias:
- Incentives + Liking = We favor ideas from people whose approval rewards us
- Incentives + Inconsistency = We defend decisions that our incentives pushed us toward
- Incentives + Envy = We chase what others have because social comparison rewards status

**Key insight:** Fixing incentives often reduces other bias effects.

### The Commitment Cascade

1. **Doubt-Avoidance** rushes to judgment
2. **Liking/Disliking** colors that judgment emotionally
3. **Inconsistency-Avoidance** defends it against evidence
4. **Incentives** further entrench positions that serve our interests

**Key insight:** Early decisions become locked. Slow down at the beginning.

### The Comparison Trap

1. **Envy** creates desire for what others have
2. **Fairness** creates outrage when we don't get it
3. **Doubt-Avoidance** rushes us to action to close the gap
4. **Inconsistency-Avoidance** defends our chase even when it's not strategic

**Key insight:** Comparison-driven decisions are rarely your best decisions.

## The CEO's Bias Recognition Checklist

Before major decisions, review:

### Incentive Check
- [ ] Whose incentives affect this decision?
- [ ] What behavior do current incentives produce?
- [ ] Are my incentives aligned with the best outcome?

### Emotional Check
- [ ] Do I like or dislike the people involved?
- [ ] Is my evaluation affected by my feelings?
- [ ] Would I decide differently with different messengers?

### Commitment Check
- [ ] Am I rushing to eliminate uncertainty?
- [ ] Am I defending a prior commitment?
- [ ] What would have to change for me to update?

### Comparison Check
- [ ] Am I making this decision based on what others are doing?
- [ ] Is envy driving this more than strategy?
- [ ] Is fairness outrage affecting my judgment?

### Curiosity Check
- [ ] Am I pursuing this out of genuine strategic interest or just curiosity?
- [ ] Is curiosity distracting from more important work?

## Building Bias Awareness into Leadership

### Personal Practice

**Daily:**
- Catch yourself making judgment calls
- Ask: "What bias might be at play here?"
- Note instances for later reflection

**Weekly:**
- Review decisions: which biases influenced them?
- Identify patterns in your typical biases
- Plan counter-measures for upcoming decisions

**Quarterly:**
- Audit major decisions for bias
- Review incentive structures
- Assess your own incentive alignment

### Team Practice

**Encourage bias callouts:**
- "I wonder if we're rushing to judgment here (doubt-avoidance)"
- "Are we pursuing this because they are (envy)?"
- "Would we feel differently if someone else proposed this (liking)?"

**Build structured countermeasures:**
- Devil's advocates assigned
- Pre-commitment to decision reviews
- Explicit criteria established before evaluation

### Organizational Practice

**Incentive design:**
- Regular audits of incentive effects
- Quick response to perverse incentives
- Alignment checks for advisory relationships

**Decision processes:**
- Cooling-off periods for major decisions
- Structured evaluation that reduces emotional influence
- Kill criteria established before commitments

## The Bias Audit Exercise

### Part 1: Personal Assessment

For each bias, rate yourself (1 = rarely affects me, 5 = strongly affects me):

| Bias | Personal Impact (1-5) | Recent Example |
|------|----------------------|----------------|
| Incentive Super-Response | | |
| Liking/Loving | | |
| Disliking/Hating | | |
| Doubt-Avoidance | | |
| Inconsistency-Avoidance | | |
| Curiosity (distraction) | | |
| Fairness | | |
| Envy/Jealousy | | |

### Part 2: Organizational Assessment

Where do you see each bias operating in your organization?

| Bias | Where I See It | Impact | What Could Change |
|------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| Incentive Super-Response | | | |
| Liking/Loving | | | |
| Disliking/Hating | | | |
| Doubt-Avoidance | | | |
| Inconsistency-Avoidance | | | |
| Envy/Jealousy | | | |

### Part 3: Priority Focus

Based on your assessment:

**My highest-impact personal bias:**


**One action to mitigate it:**


**My organization's highest-impact bias:**


**One systemic change to address it:**

## Connecting to Previous Weeks

### Biases and Mental Models (Week 1)

Mental models help counter biases:
- Multiple models reduce single-model commitment
- Models provide frameworks for objective analysis
- Latticework thinking creates distance from emotional reactions

### Biases and Inversion (Week 2)

Inversion helps with bias recognition:
- "What would guarantee failure?" often reveals biased thinking
- Pre-mortems surface bias-driven decisions before they fail
- Inverting your position tests commitment bias

### Biases and Circle of Competence (Week 3)

Operating outside your circle amplifies biases:
- Without genuine knowledge, emotional biases dominate
- Without expertise, you can't evaluate your own judgments
- Surrogate competence helps counter personal biases

## Reflection Questions

1. Which of the eight biases do you recognize most strongly in yourself?

2. Where did you catch a bias operating this week (yours or someone else's)?

3. What decision might you revisit knowing about these biases?

4. How could you restructure a system to account for one of these biases?

5. What will you do differently going forward?

## Week 4 Summary

The first eight of Munger's biases:

**The core insight:** Human thinking is systematically biased. These aren't occasional errors—they're default settings.

**The practical application:**
- Audit incentives first; they drive more than you think
- Separate emotional reactions from objective evaluation
- Slow down judgment; stay open to updating
- Play your own game, not the comparison game

**The paradox:** Knowing about biases doesn't eliminate them—but it enables designing systems and practices that mitigate their effects.

## Key Quote for the Week

> "All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there." — Charlie Munger

Know your biases. Then design your systems to work around them. Don't rely on willpower—rely on structure.
