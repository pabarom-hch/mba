# Day 2: The Edges of Competence

**Week 3 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger & Warren Buffett**

> "There are a lot of things we pass on. We have three baskets: in, out, and too tough."

---

## The Core Insight

The most dangerous territory isn't far outside your circle—it's at the edge. Just beyond your genuine expertise lies a zone where:
- You know enough to feel confident
- But not enough to be reliably right
- Your partial knowledge creates false certainty
- You don't realize you've crossed the boundary

This is where most costly mistakes happen—not from obvious ignorance, but from hidden incompetence.

---

## The Three Baskets

Buffett and Munger use a simple sorting system for decisions:

### Basket 1: In
- Clearly within competence
- Can evaluate with confidence
- Proceed with conviction

### Basket 2: Out
- Clearly outside competence
- Cannot evaluate reliably
- Pass, regardless of apparent opportunity

### Basket 3: Too Tough
- Could be inside, could be outside
- Would require more work than it's worth
- Better opportunities exist; pass

**The discipline:** Resist the temptation to force "out" and "too tough" into "in" just because you want the opportunity.

## Why the Edges Are Dangerous

### The Dunning-Kruger Zone

At the edge of your circle:
- You know enough terminology to participate
- You can form opinions that sound reasonable
- Others may not challenge you (they assume you know)
- You don't know what questions you should be asking

This is the Dunning-Kruger sweet spot: maximum confidence with insufficient knowledge.

### The Adjacent Competence Trap

Expertise in one area creates false confidence in adjacent areas:

| Real Expertise | False Confidence | The Gap |
|----------------|------------------|---------|
| Product development | Product marketing | Different skills, metrics, psychology |
| Financial analysis | Operational finance | Analysis vs. execution |
| Sales | Sales management | Doing vs. leading |
| Engineering | Engineering management | Technical vs. organizational |
| Industry A | Industry B (similar) | Different rules, relationships, dynamics |

Adjacent competence is the most common trap for smart people.

### The Success Attribution Error

Past success makes boundary confusion worse:
- "I succeeded in X, which is similar to Y"
- "My judgment was right before, so it's probably right now"
- "I've learned to trust my instincts"

But success in X doesn't guarantee competence in Y—even similar Y.

## Recognizing When You're at the Edge

### Warning Signs

**Verbal:**
- Using jargon without being able to define terms simply
- Answering questions with more jargon
- Not knowing what follow-up questions to ask

**Cognitive:**
- Feeling certain without understanding the mechanism
- Can describe "what" but not "why"
- Can't identify conditions that would change your mind

**Behavioral:**
- Relying on "instinct" where analysis would help
- Deferring to authority without evaluating logic
- Getting defensive when questioned

**Predictive:**
- Surprised by outcomes frequently
- Attributing misses to bad luck, not bad judgment
- Predictions are no better than chance

### The Depth Test

For any domain, ask yourself:
1. Could I answer adversarial questions from an expert?
2. Could I identify the key uncertainties and what would resolve them?
3. Have I made predictions in this domain and tracked their accuracy?
4. Could I identify when conditions have changed enough to invalidate my knowledge?

If you answer "no" to any of these, you're at the edge or beyond.

## Decisions at the Edge

### Option 1: Go Back Inside

If the decision isn't urgent, return to familiar territory:
- Reframe the problem in terms you understand
- Focus on aspects within your competence
- Acknowledge what you can't evaluate

### Option 2: Extend the Circle (Slowly)

If this domain is important enough, invest in genuine understanding:
- Deep study, not surface familiarity
- Mentorship from true experts
- Practice with feedback
- Time (months to years, not weeks)

### Option 3: Bring in Expert Help

If the decision is urgent and outside your circle:
- Find genuine experts (not just confident people)
- Learn to evaluate expert quality
- Understand their incentives
- Get multiple perspectives

### Option 4: Pass

If the opportunity is outside your circle and not worth the investment to bring it inside:
- Decline gracefully
- Accept that some opportunities aren't for you
- Focus energy on opportunities within competence

## The CEO's Edge Decisions

### When to Operate at the Edge

Sometimes CEOs must make decisions at the edge of their competence:
- Urgent situations requiring immediate action
- Strategic opportunities that won't wait
- Hiring for domains you don't deeply understand

In these cases:
- Acknowledge (at least to yourself) that you're at the edge
- Increase information gathering
- Seek multiple expert opinions
- Build in reversibility if possible
- Learn from the outcome

### When to Stay Inside

For decisions with:
- High stakes, low reversibility
- Long time horizons
- Competitive environments where expertise wins

Stay inside your circle or bring in those whose circle includes this.

## Building Edge Awareness

### Practice: The Edge Journal

For one week, note every decision or opinion where you might be at the edge:

| Decision | Inside/Edge/Outside? | What Made Me Think So? | Outcome |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|---------|
| | | | |

At week's end, review: Were you accurate about your edges?

### Practice: The Outsider Test

Before major decisions at the edge, imagine explaining your reasoning to someone who doesn't know you:
- Would they be convinced by your expertise?
- What questions would they ask?
- What credentials would they want to see?

If your answer relies on "trust me" rather than demonstrable expertise, you're at the edge.

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Founder as Sales Leader

A technical founder had built a successful product. When the company needed sales leadership, she decided to lead sales herself rather than hire.

**Her reasoning:** "I understand our product and customers better than anyone. Sales is just explaining value."

**The edge she didn't see:**
- Sales is a distinct discipline with specific skills
- Understanding product doesn't mean understanding sales psychology
- Her product expertise was inside her circle; sales methodology wasn't

**The outcome:** Six months of underperformance before hiring an experienced sales leader, who quickly diagnosed the issues.

### Case 2: The Banker in Operating

A former investment banker became CEO of a manufacturing company. His financial analysis was excellent—inside his circle.

**His error:** He treated operations as "just execution of financial plans."

**The edge he didn't see:**
- Manufacturing has deep domain knowledge
- Operational problems aren't visible in financial analysis until too late
- His questions to the operations team weren't the right questions

**The outcome:** Quality issues that financial metrics didn't catch until they became crisis.

### Case 3: Buffett's Correct Edge Assessment

Buffett looked at Amazon in 1999. His assessment:

"I understand the business model. I understand the customer value proposition. But I don't understand how to predict which e-commerce companies will win in 10 years. I don't know what Amazon's competitive position will be. This is at my edge or beyond."

He passed. Amazon became one of the greatest investments of all time. But Buffett doesn't regret it: "Missing opportunities outside my circle is fine. Making mistakes I can't understand is not."

## The "Too Tough" Basket

### Why It Matters

Many opportunities don't need to be analyzed deeply. They can go in "too tough" because:
- They'd require significant investment to evaluate
- Better opportunities exist within your circle
- The risk-reward doesn't justify the effort

**Buffett:** "We have a hard enough time finding things within our circle. Why struggle at the edge when easier opportunities exist?"

### When to Use "Too Tough"

- The opportunity requires developing new competence
- Evaluation would take significant time
- The expected value is modest relative to effort
- You have better alternatives

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basket Sorting

List 10 recent decisions. Sort each:

| Decision | In / Out / Too Tough | Evidence for Basket | Was I Right? |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| | | | |

### Exercise 2: Edge Identification

Identify 3 domains where you're at the edge:

| Domain | Why I Think I'm at the Edge | What Would Move Me Inside | What Would Confirm I'm Outside |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| | | | |

### Exercise 3: The Outsider Brief

For a current decision at your edge:

Write a brief as if for an outside board member. Include:
- What you know for certain
- What you're estimating
- What you don't know
- Why your judgment should be trusted

Does the brief reveal gaps?

## Reflection Questions

1. What recent decision was made at the edge of your competence? How did it turn out?

2. Where do you notice yourself using jargon without deep understanding?

3. What domains might you be overconfident in because of adjacent expertise?

4. How comfortable are you saying "this is outside my circle"? What makes it hard?

5. What decision currently in your "in" basket might actually belong in "too tough"?
