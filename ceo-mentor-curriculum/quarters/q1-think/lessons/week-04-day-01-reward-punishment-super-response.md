# Day 1: Reward and Punishment Super-Response Tendency

**Week 4 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger**

> "Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives."

## The Core Insight

Of all the cognitive biases Munger catalogued, he placed incentives at the top. Not because it's the most subtle—it's actually obvious once you see it—but because its effects are so profound and so consistently underestimated.

**The Reward and Punishment Super-Response Tendency** states that people respond to incentives with remarkable, sometimes irrational, intensity. Whatever gets rewarded gets done. Whatever gets punished gets avoided. This response is so strong that it overrides stated intentions, company values, and even ethical constraints.

Get the incentives right, and behavior follows almost automatically. Get them wrong, and no amount of training, exhortation, or values statements will fix the problem.

## Why "Super-Response"?

Munger deliberately uses "super-response" to emphasize how dramatically humans react to incentives. It's not just that incentives influence behavior—they often *dominate* it.

### The Intensity of the Response

People will:
- Work harder for bonuses than salaries
- Bend rules when rewarded for results
- Ignore problems when addressing them is punished
- Perform behaviors they know are wrong when sufficiently incentivized

### The Speed of the Response

Incentive changes produce behavioral changes remarkably quickly. Alter what gets rewarded, and watch how fast behavior shifts.

### The Persistence of the Response

As long as the incentive remains, the behavior continues—even when the person knows better, even when it harms long-term interests.

## How This Bias Operates

### Mechanism 1: Cognitive Distortion

Incentives don't just change behavior—they change *thinking*. People unconsciously adjust their beliefs to justify incentivized behavior.

**Example:** A salesperson compensated on revenue will genuinely believe their overpriced solution is best for the customer. They're not lying; they've convinced themselves.

### Mechanism 2: Attention Allocation

We pay attention to what rewards us. Metrics that aren't incentivized become invisible.

**Example:** If you reward code output but not code quality, developers stop *seeing* technical debt. It doesn't register as important.

### Mechanism 3: Risk Calibration

Incentive structures shape how people perceive and accept risk.

**Example:** Bonuses for short-term gains with no downside for losses lead to excessive risk-taking. The incentive structure makes risky bets feel prudent.

## Classic Case Studies

### Case 1: FedEx's Cargo Loading

Munger's famous example: FedEx couldn't get night-shift workers to load cargo fast enough. They tried everything—exhortation, training, discipline. Nothing worked.

**The solution:** They changed from hourly pay to shift pay. Finish loading, go home with full pay.

**The result:** Problem solved immediately. Workers figured out efficiencies management hadn't imagined.

**The lesson:** The behavior wasn't a people problem; it was an incentive problem.

### Case 2: Xerox Service Technicians

Xerox technicians were compensated for fixing machines. The more repairs, the more money.

**The perverse result:** Technicians became subtly incentivized to *not* prevent breakdowns, to *not* teach customers proper maintenance, and to favor repairs over replacements.

**The lesson:** Incentives produced exactly the behavior they rewarded—just not what management wanted.

### Case 3: Wells Fargo Account Scandal

Wells Fargo employees were incentivized on the number of accounts opened. The metric seemed reasonable.

**The perverse result:** Employees opened millions of fraudulent accounts, moving money without customer knowledge.

**The lesson:** Employees responded rationally to the incentive. The scandal was an incentive design failure, not a morality failure.

### Case 4: Soviet Nail Factories

The apocryphal story: Factories measured on *weight* of nails produced made a few giant, unusable nails. Factories measured on *number* of nails made countless tiny, unusable nails.

**The lesson:** You get exactly what you measure, nothing more.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Audit Your Incentive Structures

For each team and role, map:

| Role | Official Incentive | Actual Incentive | Behavior Produced | Intended Behavior |
|------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**Questions to ask:**
- What do people *actually* get rewarded for (promotions, bonuses, recognition)?
- What behaviors does this incentivize?
- Are there gaps between intended and actual incentives?

### Application 2: The Consultant Test

Munger notes that consultants and professionals often have incentives misaligned with clients.

**The question:** "Whose paycheck depends on this recommendation?"

If an advisor benefits from a particular outcome, weight their advice accordingly.

**CEO practice:** For every piece of advice you receive, ask: "How is this person compensated? Does their recommendation align with their incentive?"

### Application 3: Designing Good Incentives

**Principles for CEO incentive design:**

1. **Reward outcomes, not activities** (when possible)
2. **Align time horizons** (avoid rewarding short-term at expense of long-term)
3. **Include quality metrics** (speed without quality is destruction)
4. **Build in long-term accountability** (clawbacks, vesting, delayed bonuses)
5. **Watch for gaming** (any metric will be optimized—sometimes destructively)

### Application 4: Your Own Incentives

CEOs aren't immune. What incentivizes you?

- Board expectations?
- Equity vesting schedules?
- Personal reputation?
- Competitive dynamics?

Where might your incentives lead you away from the right long-term decision?

## The Self-Serving Bias Connection

Incentives don't just change behavior—they change what people believe is true and right. This is the particularly dangerous aspect.

**The pattern:**
1. Person has financial interest in outcome X
2. Person genuinely comes to believe X is right/true
3. Person advocates for X with authentic conviction
4. Neither they nor others recognize the bias

**The implication:** When someone tells you something that benefits them, they probably believe it sincerely. That doesn't make it true.

## Warning Signs of Misaligned Incentives

You may have incentive problems if:

- People consistently do things that seem irrational or counterproductive
- The same mistakes keep recurring despite training
- High-performers in one metric are low-performers in others
- Departments optimize their own metrics at others' expense
- Ethical violations keep surprising you

---

## Designing Counter-Incentives

When you can't eliminate a perverse incentive, you can sometimes counter it.

**Examples:**
- Clawbacks for short-term bonuses if long-term harm emerges
- 360-degree reviews that check against gaming
- Quality gates that must be passed before quantity rewards
- Customer satisfaction scores that balance revenue metrics

---

## The Meta-Lesson

Munger's most important point about incentives: **Never underestimate them.**

Intelligent people consistently believe that they, their colleagues, and their organizations can overcome incentive problems through:
- Good intentions
- Ethical training
- Company values
- Personal integrity

They're usually wrong. Incentives are stronger than intentions.

**The wise approach:** Design systems that align incentives with desired outcomes. Don't rely on humans overcoming incentives through willpower.

## Practical Exercise

### The Incentive Audit

Choose one role or team in your organization.

1. **List the formal incentives** (compensation, bonuses, promotion criteria)

2. **List the informal incentives** (recognition, interesting work, autonomy)

3. **For each incentive, predict the behavior it produces**

4. **Compare to the behavior you actually want**

5. **Identify gaps and misalignments**

6. **Propose one change that would better align incentives with desired behavior**

---

## Reflection Questions

1. What behavior are you getting in your organization that frustrates you? What incentive might be producing it?

2. Where do your incentives contradict your stated values?

3. Who advises you where their incentives might not align with your interests?

4. What are you personally incentivized to do that might not be best for the company long-term?

5. Where have you underestimated the power of incentives?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason." — Benjamin Franklin (cited by Munger)

Incentives don't just influence behavior—they determine it. Your job is to ensure they determine the right behavior.

## Tomorrow's Preview

**Day 2** explores the **Liking/Loving Tendency**—how affection distorts our judgment and leads us to overlook flaws, favor friends, and distort reality to favor those we like.
