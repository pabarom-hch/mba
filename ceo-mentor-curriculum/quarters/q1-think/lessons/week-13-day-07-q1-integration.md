## The Week in Review

This week explored compounding—the most powerful force in finance and life, and the culmination of Q1's lessons.

| Day | Topic | Core Concept |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Mathematics of Compounding | Small advantages × time = enormous outcomes |
| 2 | Knowledge Compounds | Reading and learning build on themselves |
| 3 | Relationships Compound | Trust and connection grow exponentially |
| 4 | Reputation Compounds | Integrity accumulates; destruction is instant |
| 5 | The Enemy of Compounding | Interruptions reset to zero |
| 6 | Designing for Compounding | Make time your friend |

## The Complete Compounding Framework

### What Compounds

**Everything important:**
- Money and investments
- Knowledge and learning
- Skills and expertise
- Relationships and trust
- Reputation and integrity
- Health and habits
- Organizations and capabilities

### The Requirements for Compounding

**1. Time**
- Years and decades, not months
- Patience is the key ingredient
- Most gains come late in the curve

**2. Consistency**
- Regular contributions
- Steady improvement
- No interruptions

**3. Reinvestment**
- Plow returns back in
- Delay gratification
- Let the snowball grow

**4. Protection**
- Don't interrupt
- Don't withdraw
- Don't reset to zero

## Q1 Complete Integration: THINK

### The Quarter Summary

Over 13 weeks, you've studied how to think:

| Week | Topic | Mentor | Key Lesson |
|------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Mental Models | Munger | Build a latticework of multiple models |
| 2 | Inversion | Munger | Think problems backward to find solutions |
| 3 | Circle of Competence | Munger | Know what you know and what you don't |
| 4 | Psychology of Misjudgment (Part 1) | Munger | Recognize cognitive biases |
| 5 | Psychology of Misjudgment (Part 2) | Munger | Understand deeper psychological tendencies |
| 6 | Psychology of Misjudgment (Part 3) | Munger | Combat the lollapalooza effect |
| 7 | Long-Term Thinking | Buffett | Think in decades, not quarters |
| 8 | Owner Mentality | Buffett | Think like an owner, not a renter |
| 9 | Economic Moats | Buffett | Build and widen competitive advantages |
| 10 | Margin of Safety | Buffett | Always leave room for error |
| 11 | Integrity as Strategy | Buffett | Reputation is competitive advantage |
| 12 | Simplicity and Focus | Buffett | Say no to almost everything |
| 13 | Compounding | Buffett | Small advantages × time = enormous outcomes |

### How It All Connects

**Mental models + Inversion** → Better analytical frameworks
**Circle of Competence + Biases** → More accurate self-assessment
**Long-Term Thinking + Owner Mentality** → Better decision orientation
**Economic Moats + Margin of Safety** → More resilient businesses
**Integrity + Simplicity + Compounding** → Sustainable excellence

**The synthesis:** Clear thinking, applied with patience and integrity, creates compounding advantage over decades.

## Key Principles from Q1

### From Munger

1. **Build a latticework of mental models.** Don't rely on one discipline's thinking.

2. **Invert, always invert.** See problems backward to find solutions.

3. **Know the edge of your competence.** Operate within, expand carefully, get help outside.

4. **Understand psychological misjudgment.** You're biased; compensate for it.

### From Buffett

5. **Think in decades.** Short-term pressure is the enemy of good decisions.

6. **Think like an owner.** Would you make this decision if you owned 100%?

7. **Build and widen moats.** Competitive advantage that grows with time.

8. **Always build in margin of safety.** You will be wrong; leave room for error.

9. **Integrity is strategy.** Reputation compounds; protect it obsessively.

10. **Simplify relentlessly.** Say no to almost everything; focus intensely.

11. **Design for compounding.** Small advantages × time = enormous outcomes.

## Key Quote for the Quarter

> "The most important investment you can make is in yourself."

Q1 was that investment. You've built mental models, studied biases, and absorbed wisdom from two of history's greatest thinkers. Now compound it.
