# Day 2: Skin in the Game

**Week 8 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

> "A public-loss-private-gain nature is present in most transactions."

## The Core Insight

"Skin in the game" means bearing the consequences of your decisions. When you have skin in the game, your incentives are aligned with outcomes. When you don't, a dangerous gap opens between what's good for you and what's good for the enterprise.

Buffett obsesses about this alignment. He puts virtually all of his wealth in Berkshire. He doesn't take stock options. His interests are inseparable from shareholders'. This isn't virtue—it's structural wisdom.

## The Alignment Problem

### The Principal-Agent Gap

In most organizations, managers (agents) make decisions for owners (principals). The managers' interests often diverge from owners' interests:

**Managers may want:**
- Higher compensation regardless of performance
- Career advancement through visible activity
- Risk avoidance that protects their position
- Short-term metrics that look good on their watch

**Owners may want:**
- Value creation over time
- Appropriate risk-taking
- Long-term orientation
- Sustainable performance

When these diverge, the manager's interest typically wins—they make the daily decisions.

### Hidden Misalignment

Misalignment isn't always obvious. It hides in:
- Compensation structures that reward short-term
- Career incentives that favor activity over results
- Risk asymmetry (upside for success, limited downside for failure)
- Information asymmetry (managers know more than owners)

## Buffett's Approach to Alignment

### Personal Wealth Alignment

Buffett has virtually all his wealth in Berkshire stock. He doesn't diversify. If Berkshire fails, he fails personally.

**Why this matters:**
- His interests are perfectly aligned with shareholders
- He has maximum incentive to think long-term
- He can't benefit from decisions that hurt shareholders
- His skin is genuinely in the game

### No Stock Options

Buffett doesn't take stock options. He thinks they create misalignment:
- Options benefit from volatility
- Options encourage short-term stock price focus
- Options can be repriced when underwater
- Options create asymmetric risk (upside without downside)

### The Owner-Operator Preference

When acquiring companies, Buffett prefers owner-operators—managers who own significant stakes:
- Their wealth is tied to performance
- They think like owners because they are owners
- They can't externalize consequences
- Alignment is structural, not contractual

## Where Misalignment Damages

### Misalignment in Leadership

**Executive compensation:**
- Large guaranteed salary regardless of performance
- Bonuses based on metrics that can be gamed
- Options that encourage short-term stock focus
- Golden parachutes that eliminate downside

**Career incentives:**
- Promotions based on visible activity
- "Moving on" before consequences land
- Resume optimization over value creation
- Political success over business success

### Misalignment in Advisory Relationships

**Investment banking:**
- Fees based on deal completion, not deal quality
- Incentive to do deals, any deals
- No skin in the game for long-term outcome

**Consulting:**
- Fees based on engagement length
- Incentive to find more problems requiring more consulting
- No stake in implementation success

### Misalignment in Organizations

**Budget allocation:**
- Department heads incentivized to grow empires
- No penalty for failed initiatives
- Use-it-or-lose-it budget psychology

**Performance management:**
- Short-term metrics dominate evaluation
- Long-term value creation invisible
- Gaming metrics becomes rational

## Creating Genuine Alignment

### For Yourself

**Assess your alignment:**
- What percentage of your wealth is tied to company success?
- What happens to you personally if the company fails?
- Would you make the same decisions if you bore full consequences?

**Increase your skin:**
- Take more equity, less guaranteed compensation
- Extend vesting periods
- Accept clawback provisions
- Invest personal capital beyond compensation equity

**Align your career incentives:**
- Stay long enough to see consequences
- Build reputation on long-term results
- Accept accountability for decisions

### For Your Team

**Design aligned compensation:**
- Equity with meaningful vesting
- Bonuses tied to long-term metrics
- Clawbacks for decisions that look good then go bad
- Downside as well as upside

**Create aligned incentives:**
- Evaluate based on long-term value creation
- Track predictions and outcomes
- Hold people accountable for decisions over time
- Reward genuine contribution, not activity

### For Advisory Relationships

**Check advisor incentives:**
- How are they compensated?
- What happens to them if their advice is wrong?
- Do their incentives align with your interests?

**Create aligned structures:**
- Performance-based fees where possible
- Long-term relationships over transactions
- Reference checks on advice quality
- Skin in the game for advisors

---

## The Skin Test

For any decision-maker or advisor, ask:

**What happens to them if this goes well?**
- Do they benefit appropriately?
- Is the benefit tied to genuine success?

**What happens to them if this goes badly?**
- Do they bear appropriate consequences?
- Can they externalize the downside?

**Is there asymmetry?**
- Upside without downside creates moral hazard
- The bigger the asymmetry, the more skeptical you should be

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Aligned CEO

A CEO took low salary and high equity. When the company struggled, he didn't get paid. When it succeeded, he benefited enormously.

**The behavior this created:**
- Genuine long-term focus
- Appropriate risk-taking
- Personal investment in every decision
- Alignment visible to the organization

### Case 2: The Misaligned Advisor

A company hired an investment bank to advise on strategic options. The bank was paid transaction fees—more money for deals, nothing for recommending patience.

**The behavior this created:**
- Advice biased toward transactions
- Options that didn't involve deals underemphasized
- "Do nothing" rarely recommended
- Client's long-term interests secondary to transaction generation

### Case 3: The Options Misalignment

Executives were compensated heavily in stock options. As options underwater, they lobbied for repricing, then took excessive risks to drive stock price.

**The behavior this created:**
- Short-term stock price focus
- Excessive risk-taking
- Heads I win, tails someone else loses mentality
- Eventual disaster for shareholders

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Incentive Autopsy

Take a decision that went wrong.

1. Who made or influenced the decision?
2. What were their incentives?
3. How did those incentives shape the decision?
4. What would aligned incentives have produced?

### Exercise 2: The Compensation Review

Examine your own compensation:

1. What's guaranteed vs. at-risk?
2. What time horizon do the incentives favor?
3. What happens if the company fails?
4. What would more aligned compensation look like?

### Exercise 3: The Advisor Audit

For each significant advisor:

1. How are they compensated?
2. What behavior does that compensation encourage?
3. Would they give different advice with different incentives?
4. How can you create better alignment?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. How aligned are your personal outcomes with the organization's long-term success?

2. Where might your interests diverge from owners' interests?

3. What percentage of your compensation is genuinely at-risk based on long-term value creation?

4. Who advises you whose incentives might not align with your interests?

5. What changes would create better alignment in your organization?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Never ask a barber if you need a haircut."

Misaligned incentives produce predictable advice. The barber will always say you need a haircut. The investment banker will always find a deal. Check incentives before trusting advice.
