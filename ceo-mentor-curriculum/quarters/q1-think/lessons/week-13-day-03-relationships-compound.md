**Week 13 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

## The Core Insight

Relationships compound like investments. Each interaction can build or deplete the relationship account. Over time, strong relationships create exponential value through trust, opportunities, and mutual support. Weak relationships decay into nothing.

The people you spend time with shape who you become. Choose wisely, invest consistently, and watch relationships compound into your greatest asset.

## How Relationships Compound

### The Trust Accumulation

**Trust builds on trust:**
- Each kept promise adds
- Each honest interaction deepens
- Each year strengthens
- Eventually, trust is automatic

**The compound effect:**
- Year 1: Some trust established
- Year 5: Deep trust developed
- Year 10: Near-complete trust
- Year 20+: Unshakeable foundation

### The Network Effect

**Relationships multiply:**
- Each relationship connects to others
- Introductions expand network
- Reputation travels through connections
- Opportunities flow through networks

**The compound effect:**
- Each relationship adds more than one connection
- Quality begets quality
- Network grows exponentially
- Reach expands beyond direct contacts

### The Reputation Effect

**Relationships broadcast reputation:**
- People talk about you
- Recommendations carry weight
- References matter
- Reputation precedes you

**The compound effect:**
- Each positive interaction creates ambassadors
- Ambassadors tell others
- Reputation grows beyond direct experience
- Doors open before you arrive
