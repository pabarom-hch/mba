# Day 3: The Economics Model — Incentives

**Week 1 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger**

> "Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives."

## The Core Insight

Of all the mental models Munger teaches, incentives may be the most powerful. It's deceptively simple: **people respond to incentives.** They do what they're rewarded for and avoid what they're punished for.

The insight isn't that incentives exist—everyone knows that. The insight is that incentives are **almost always operating**, often invisibly, and explain far more behavior than we typically recognize.

When you're confused by someone's behavior, Munger says, look for the incentive. You'll almost always find it.

## Why Incentives Are Foundational

### 1. Incentives Explain Behavior

Most behavior that seems irrational becomes rational when you understand the incentive structure:

- Why does the salesperson push a product that's wrong for the customer? **Commission structure**
- Why does the manager hide bad news? **Performance evaluation tied to results**
- Why does the employee resist a change that would help the company? **Change threatens their status or job**
- Why does the advisor recommend a complex solution? **Fees tied to complexity**

**Munger's principle:** "Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome."

### 2. Incentives Predict Behavior

If you understand the incentive structure, you can predict what people will do—often better than they can predict themselves.

People will tell you their intentions. Incentives will tell you their likely actions.

This isn't cynicism—it's realism. Even well-intentioned people tend toward what they're incentivized to do, especially over time and at scale.

### 3. Incentives Shape Culture

An organization's culture is largely the accumulated effect of its incentives. If you want to understand why a company behaves the way it does, study what it rewards and punishes.

- **What gets promoted?** That's what people will optimize for
- **What gets punished?** That's what people will avoid
- **What gets measured?** That's what people will focus on
- **What gets ignored?** That's what people will neglect

## The Anatomy of Incentives

### Types of Incentives

**Financial Incentives**
- Salary, bonus, commission, equity
- The most obvious but not always the most powerful

**Status Incentives**
- Title, recognition, access, visibility
- Often underestimated; humans are status-seeking creatures

**Social Incentives**
- Peer approval, belonging, reputation
- "What will people think?" drives enormous amounts of behavior

**Psychological Incentives**
- Autonomy, mastery, purpose
- Internal rewards that don't show up on a compensation statement

**Security Incentives**
- Job safety, predictability, risk avoidance
- Fear of loss often outweighs desire for gain

### The Incentive Stack

People respond to multiple incentives simultaneously. Understanding behavior requires understanding the full stack:

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
    │  Purpose/Meaning (highest)   │
    ├─────────────────────────────┤
    │  Status/Recognition          │
    ├─────────────────────────────┤
    │  Social/Belonging            │
    ├─────────────────────────────┤
    │  Security/Stability          │
    ├─────────────────────────────┤
    │  Financial (most visible)    │
    └─────────────────────────────┘
```

A purely financial analysis often misses the incentives that matter most.

## Incentive Misalignment: Where Things Go Wrong

### The Principal-Agent Problem

When someone acts on your behalf (agent), their incentives may not align with yours (principal):

| Agent | Principal | Agent's Incentive | Principal's Interest |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Fund manager | Investor | Assets under management | Investment returns |
| Real estate agent | Buyer | Transaction closes quickly | Best price |
| Doctor | Patient | Defensive medicine, procedures | Health outcomes |
| Employee | Company | Job security | Company success |

This isn't about bad people—it's about structural incentive misalignment.

### The Cobra Effect

Well-intentioned incentives often backfire spectacularly:

**The original Cobra Effect:** The British government in colonial India offered bounties for dead cobras to reduce the snake population. People started breeding cobras for the bounty. When the program ended, breeders released their now-worthless snakes, increasing the cobra population.

**Business examples:**
- Pay for lines of code → bloated, unmaintainable code
- Pay for bugs found → testers collude with developers to create bugs
- Pay for calls resolved → rush customers off the phone, problems unresolved
- Pay for new customers → ignore retention, customers churn

**The lesson:** Think through second-order effects of any incentive you create.

### Goodhart's Law

> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

The moment you incentivize a metric, people optimize for the metric rather than the underlying goal the metric was supposed to represent.

- Revenue targets → discounting that destroys margins
- Call time targets → hanging up on customers
- Code coverage targets → meaningless tests
- Publication targets → salami-slicing research

---

## Incentive Design Principles

### Principle 1: Align Incentives with Outcomes You Actually Want

Ask not "What behavior am I rewarding?" but "What behavior will this reward produce?"

Think through:
- First-order effects (the intended behavior)
- Second-order effects (gaming, unintended consequences)
- Third-order effects (culture, long-term dynamics)

### Principle 2: Use Multiple Incentive Types

Don't rely solely on financial incentives. Build a stack:

| Incentive Type | Implementation |
|----------------|----------------|
| Purpose | Connect work to meaningful impact |
| Status | Recognition, titles, access |
| Social | Team belonging, peer respect |
| Security | Clear path, job stability |
| Financial | Comp tied to right outcomes |

### Principle 3: Incentivize Outcomes, Not Activities

Where possible, reward the result rather than the process:

| Activity-Based (Risky) | Outcome-Based (Better) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Hours worked | Projects completed |
| Calls made | Deals closed |
| Reports written | Decisions improved |
| Meetings attended | Problems solved |

### Principle 4: Consider Time Horizons

Short-term incentives drive short-term behavior:

| Incentive Horizon | Typical Behavior |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Quarterly bonus | Optimize for quarter, ignore long-term |
| Annual review | Optimize for year, discount the future |
| Multi-year vesting | Balance short and medium-term |
| Ownership/equity | Align with long-term value |

### Principle 5: Watch for Emergent Gaming

Any incentive system will be gamed. The question is how and whether the gaming is harmful:

- **Acceptable gaming:** Working harder to hit targets
- **Problematic gaming:** Cooking the books to hit targets
- **Destructive gaming:** Sabotaging others to look better

Build monitoring systems. Update incentives as gaming emerges.

## Incentive Analysis for CEOs

### Your Own Incentives

Be honest about your own incentive structure:

| Incentive | How It Might Bias Your Decisions |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Compensation tied to stock price | Short-term stock optimization |
| Bonus tied to revenue | Growth over profitability |
| Status as "innovative CEO" | Chasing headlines over fundamentals |
| Fear of board criticism | Risk aversion, conventional choices |
| Ego/legacy | Projects that enhance reputation |

You're not immune to incentives. Awareness is the first defense.

### Your Team's Incentives

Map the incentive structure of your leadership team:

| Role | Stated Goal | Actual Incentive | Potential Misalignment |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| CFO | Company value | Risk management | Over-caution? |
| CMO | Brand/growth | Marketing spend | Empire building? |
| CTO | Technology | Technical excellence | Over-engineering? |
| CHRO | Talent | Employee satisfaction | Avoiding hard calls? |

### Your Organization's Incentives

Audit key systems:

**Compensation system:**
- What does the bonus structure actually reward?
- Do incentives differ by level, function, tenure?
- What's the balance of individual vs. team incentives?

**Promotion system:**
- What gets people promoted?
- What should get people promoted?
- Are they the same?

**Performance management:**
- What behaviors are praised?
- What behaviors are punished?
- What behaviors are ignored?

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Wells Fargo's Cross-Selling Disaster

**The incentive:** Aggressive targets for "cross-selling" products to existing customers, tied to compensation and job security.

**The behavior:** Employees created millions of fake accounts without customer knowledge or consent.

**The lesson:** When incentives are strong enough, people will find ways to hit targets—even illegal, unethical ways. The pressure came from the top; the gaming happened at the bottom.

**The fix:** Redesigned incentives, eliminated cross-selling targets, tied compensation to customer outcomes rather than product counts.

### Case 2: Surgical Outcomes and Risk Selection

**The incentive:** Surgeons' success rates published publicly, affecting reputation and referrals.

**The behavior:** Some surgeons declined high-risk patients who genuinely needed surgery to protect their statistics.

**The lesson:** Incentivizing outcomes without adjusting for risk creates perverse selection effects.

**The fix:** Risk-adjusted metrics that account for case difficulty.

### Case 3: The Startup Equity Trap

**The incentive:** Founders and early employees hold significant equity.

**The behavior (positive):** Alignment with long-term value creation.

**The behavior (negative):** Reluctance to sell or pivot even when optimal, because equity becomes identity.

**The lesson:** Even well-designed incentives have shadow sides.

## Munger's Warnings on Incentives

### Warning 1: Never Underestimate Incentive Power

> "I think I've been in the top 5% of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I've underestimated it."

If Munger underestimates incentives, so do you.

### Warning 2: Incentives Trump Everything

Good intentions, training, culture, ethics—all tend to bend toward incentives over time. Not immediately, not completely, but persistently.

### Warning 3: Beware of Perverse Incentives You Create

As a leader, you create incentive structures. Every policy, every metric, every reward system is an incentive structure. You own the outcomes.

---

## The Incentive Mindset

When you fully internalize incentive thinking, you:

1. **Ask about incentives first** when trying to understand behavior
2. **Design incentives carefully** before implementing policies
3. **Monitor for gaming** and adjust when it emerges
4. **Check your own incentives** for blind spots they might create
5. **Never assume good intentions** will overcome bad incentives

---

## Reflection Questions

1. What behavior in your organization has frustrated you? What incentive is driving it?

2. What does your compensation structure actually reward? Is it what you want?

3. Where might your own incentives bias your judgment?

4. What incentive have you created that backfired? What did you learn?

5. Who in your organization has incentives most misaligned with company success? What can you do about it?
