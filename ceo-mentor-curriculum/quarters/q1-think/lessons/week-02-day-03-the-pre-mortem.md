# Day 3: The Pre-Mortem

**Week 2 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger**

> "The best way to avoid failure is to study failure."

## The Core Insight

A post-mortem happens after something fails. You gather the team, analyze what went wrong, and try to learn from it. It's valuable, but it's too late—the damage is done.

A **pre-mortem** flips the timeline. You imagine the project has already failed—spectacularly—and then work backward to explain why. This surfaces risks and failure modes before they materialize.

Psychologist Gary Klein developed the formal technique, but the principle is pure Munger: use inversion to see what forward-looking optimism obscures.

## Why Pre-Mortems Work

### 1. Permission to Speak

In typical planning meetings, expressing doubts feels disloyal. The pre-mortem reframes skepticism as helpful analysis.

**Normal planning:** "What concerns do you have?" (Raises hand = pessimist)

**Pre-mortem:** "The project failed. Why?" (Raises hand = analyst)

The same concern becomes socially acceptable because you're explaining a hypothetical past, not predicting a negative future.

### 2. Prospective Hindsight

Research shows that imagining an event has already happened increases our ability to identify causes by 30%.

**Why it works:**
- The future feels uncertain and distant
- The past (even imagined) feels concrete and analyzable
- We're better at explaining than predicting

When you say "the project failed," your brain shifts from prediction mode to explanation mode—and explanation mode is more accurate.

### 3. Counteracting Optimism Bias

By the time a project is in motion, optimism dominates:
- Resources are committed
- Reputations are attached
- Momentum discourages doubt

The pre-mortem creates a structured moment for pessimism before optimism takes over completely.

## The Pre-Mortem Protocol

### Step 1: Set the Scene

Gather your team. Explain the exercise:

> "Imagine it's [date in future—project end date]. The project has failed badly. Not just missed targets—spectacularly, embarrassingly failed. Our job today is to explain what happened."

Key elements:
- **Make it vivid:** Not "might have failed" but "has failed"
- **Make it severe:** Not minor setback but spectacular failure
- **Make it specific:** Choose a concrete future date

### Step 2: Individual Brainstorm (5-10 minutes)

Each person writes independently:
- Why did the project fail?
- What went wrong?
- What did we miss?
- What should we have seen coming?

**Why individual first:**
- Prevents groupthink
- Gives introverts voice
- Surfaces diverse perspectives
- Avoids anchoring on first ideas shared

### Step 3: Share and Compile

Go around the room. Each person shares one reason. Continue rounds until all ideas are captured.

**Rules:**
- No discussion or debate during sharing
- All ideas captured without judgment
- Quantity matters—aim for 10-20 failure modes

### Step 4: Categorize and Prioritize

Group failure modes into categories:
- Technical/product failures
- Market/customer failures
- Team/execution failures
- External/environmental failures
- Resource/timeline failures

Prioritize by:
- Likelihood
- Impact severity
- How much we control

### Step 5: Develop Prevention Plans

For the top 5-10 failure modes:
- What early warning signs would we see?
- What can we do now to prevent this?
- What contingency should we have if this happens?

### Step 6: Integrate into Plan

Update the project plan to include:
- Prevention measures
- Monitoring for warning signs
- Contingency plans

## Pre-Mortem Templates

### For a Major Initiative

**Scenario:** "It's 18 months from now. Our [initiative name] has failed badly. We've lost $X million, [key stakeholders] are unhappy, and our reputation is damaged. Write the story of what happened."

2. What risks did we ignore?
3. What stakeholders did we fail to manage?
4. What execution problems occurred?
5. What external factors changed?

**Scenario:** "It's 6 months after launch. The product has flopped—adoption is 10% of target, reviews are terrible, and we're considering shutting it down. What happened?"

**Prompt questions:**
1. What customer need did we misunderstand?
2. What competitive response did we miss?
3. What technical problems emerged?
4. What go-to-market failures occurred?
5. What did we learn too late?

3. What competitor actions did we miss?
4. What capabilities did we overestimate?
5. What did the board wish they had challenged?

## Common Pre-Mortem Failure Modes

### 1. Not Taking It Seriously

**Symptoms:**
- Jokes and dismissiveness
- Superficial answers
- Rushing through the exercise

**Solution:**
- Frame as genuine risk management
- Connect to real past failures
- Have leadership model seriousness

### 2. Groupthink Persists

**Symptoms:**
- Everyone agrees on the obvious risks
- Novel perspectives not surfaced
- Optimism reasserts quickly

**Solution:**
- Mandate individual writing first
- Specifically ask for contrarian views
- Bring in outside perspectives

### 3. No Follow-Through

**Symptoms:**
- Great list of risks identified
- Plan unchanged
- Risks forgotten until they materialize

**Solution:**
- Assign owners to each key risk
- Build prevention into project plan
- Schedule risk review checkpoints

### 4. Too Many Risks

**Symptoms:**
- 50+ failure modes identified
- Analysis paralysis
- Can't address everything

**Solution:**
- Ruthlessly prioritize
- Focus on high-impact, addressable risks
- Accept some risks with contingency plans

## The Psychology of Pre-Mortems

### Why People Resist

**Loss of optimism:** The pre-mortem forces confrontation with failure possibility. This is uncomfortable.

**Fear of jinxing:** Superstitious belief that discussing failure makes it more likely. (The opposite is true.)

**Cognitive load:** Adding analysis to an already complex project feels burdensome.

**Authority challenge:** Questioning the plan might feel like questioning leadership.

### Why to Push Through

**Reduction of anxiety:** Counterintuitively, naming fears reduces their power.

**Increased confidence:** A plan that has survived pre-mortem scrutiny is more robust.

**Team alignment:** Shared understanding of risks creates better coordination.

**Better outcomes:** Projects that use pre-mortems are more likely to succeed.

## Pre-Mortem for CEOs

### Your Personal Pre-Mortem

**Scenario:** "It's 5 years from now. I've failed as CEO—the board has replaced me, the company is struggling, my reputation is damaged. What happened?"

Spend 20 minutes writing the story. Be honest about your specific vulnerabilities.

**Common CEO failure modes:**
- Lost touch with customers/market
- Failed to build strong team
- Ego prevented course correction
- Couldn't adapt to change
- Burned out and judgment suffered
- Didn't manage board relationship
- Strategic bet failed
- Execution persistently weak
- Culture deteriorated
- Made bad acquisition

**Now ask:**
- Which of these am I most vulnerable to?
- What early warning signs should I watch for?
- What am I doing now that might lead to this failure?

### Company-Level Pre-Mortem

**Scenario:** "It's 10 years from now. The company is gone—bankrupt, irrelevant, or acquired in distress. What happened?"

Run this exercise with your leadership team annually. Compare year-over-year:
- What risks persist?
- What new risks have emerged?
- Are we actively preventing the most likely failure modes?

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Intel's Pre-Mortem Missed

**The situation:** Intel dominated PC microprocessors but faced the rise of mobile.

**The pre-mortem they didn't do:** "It's 2020. Intel has become irrelevant. What happened?"
- Mobile processors mattered more than we thought
- We didn't invest sufficiently in ARM architecture
- Power efficiency trumped raw performance
- We focused on protecting PC business, not winning next business

**The result:** Intel missed mobile. TSMC and ARM-based designs now dominate. Intel's market cap has been surpassed by NVIDIA.

**The lesson:** The pre-mortem would have surfaced the mobile threat early enough to respond.

### Case 2: NASA's Pre-Launch Pre-Mortem

**The situation:** Challenger disaster (1986) might have been prevented.

**What a pre-mortem would have surfaced:**
- O-ring concerns in cold weather
- Pressure to launch despite engineering warnings
- Culture of normalizing risk

**Post-implementation:** After Challenger and Columbia, NASA implemented rigorous pre-launch risk reviews that function like pre-mortems.

### Case 3: Successful Pre-Mortem at Klein's Research

**The situation:** A team planning a new software implementation.

**Pre-mortem surfaced:**
- The vendor had failed similar implementations before
- Key internal stakeholder was skeptical and might undermine
- Timeline didn't account for integration complexity
- Training budget was unrealistic

**The result:** Team added vendor references, engaged skeptical stakeholder early, extended timeline, and tripled training budget. Implementation succeeded.

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing." — Socrates

The pre-mortem is an exercise in intellectual humility. It says: "We think this will work, but we might be wrong. Let's figure out how before it's too late."
