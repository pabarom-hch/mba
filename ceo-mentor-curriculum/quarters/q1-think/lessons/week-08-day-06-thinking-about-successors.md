# Day 6: Thinking About Successors

**Week 8 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

> "When a manager wants to acquire a company, he should think about one thing: 'Would I want to own this company if there was no stock market?'"

## The Core Insight

Owners think beyond themselves. They consider what they'll leave to those who come after. This orientation—building for successors rather than just their own tenure—fundamentally shapes decision-making.

A leader who thinks about successors invests in the future, maintains assets, and builds systems that outlast them. A leader who doesn't extracts value during their tenure and leaves problems for others.

## The Successor Frame

### The Key Questions

**What am I building that will outlast me?**
- Systems that persist
- Culture that self-reinforces
- Capabilities that compound
- Reputation that endures

**What am I leaving behind?**
- Well-maintained assets
- Developed people
- Strong position
- Clear direction

**Will my successor thank me or curse me?**
- For the investments I made
- For the problems I solved
- For the maintenance I kept up
- For the messes I didn't leave

### The Time Extension

Thinking about successors extends your time horizon beyond your tenure:
- Decisions that look good for your term might look bad for the next
- Investments that don't pay off until after you leave might be most valuable
- Problems deferred are problems gifted to your successor

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Building Leader

A CEO invested heavily in leadership development, even though most leaders wouldn't reach full effectiveness until after she left.

**What she left:**
- Strong bench of capable leaders

- Systems that identified and grew talent

**Her successor's experience:**
- Inherited a ready team
- Could move quickly on initiatives

### Case 2: The Extracting Leader

A CEO maximized short-term results by cutting investment, deferring maintenance, and running people hard.

**What he left:**
- Degraded assets
- Burned-out team
- Deferred problems

**His successor's experience:**
- Spent first two years repairing damage
- Lost key people
- Cursed the predecessor regularly

### Case 3: The Succession-Conscious Leader

A CEO explicitly planned for succession:
- Developed multiple candidates
- Built systems that didn't depend on him
- Documented critical knowledge
- Prepared the organization for transition

**What he left:**
- Clear succession options
- Organization ready for new leadership
- Smooth transition

**His successor's experience:**

## Building for Successors

### Invest in People Beyond Your Tenure

- Develop leaders you won't benefit from
- Build bench strength
- Create succession pathways
- Don't hoard talent for "your" projects

### Build Systems That Outlast You

- Document processes
- Create systems that don't depend on individuals
- Build institutional knowledge
- Reduce single points of failure

### Maintain Assets for the Next Generation

- Keep assets in good condition
- Don't defer maintenance
- Invest in renewal
- Think about 20-year, not 2-year horizons

### Solve Problems Before They Compound

- Address emerging issues
- Don't defer hard decisions
- Fix things now, not later
- Leave a clean slate

### Create Transition Readiness

- Develop succession candidates
- Document critical knowledge
- Build organizational capability
- Prepare for smooth handoff

## The Succession Mindset

### Start Early

Don't wait until you're leaving to think about succession. Build for it throughout:
- Every person developed is succession preparation
- Every system documented is transition readiness
- Every problem solved is a gift to successors

### Assume You'll Leave

You will leave eventually. Denial doesn't help. Planning does.
- What if you left tomorrow?
- What if you left in five years?
- What needs to be true for a smooth transition?

### Measure Successor Readiness

Include in your assessment:
- How ready is the organization for my departure?
- Who could step in?
- What would be lost?
- What would need to change?
