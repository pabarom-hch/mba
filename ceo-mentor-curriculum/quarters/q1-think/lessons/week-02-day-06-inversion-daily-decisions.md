# Day 6: Inversion in Daily Decisions

**Week 2 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger**

> "A lot of success in life comes from knowing what you really want to avoid—like early death, a bad marriage, etc."

## The Core Insight

Inversion isn't just for major strategic decisions. It's a daily practice—a mental habit that improves the quality of countless small choices.

The leader who asks "How could this meeting be terrible?" before walking in will run better meetings than the one who only asks "How do I make this productive?"

Inversion, practiced daily, becomes automatic. Your default question shifts from "What should I do?" to "What should I avoid?"

## Daily Inversion Applications

### Morning: Starting the Day

**Normal approach:** What do I need to accomplish today?

**Inverted approach:** What would make today a disaster?

**Example disaster list:**
- Reactive all day (no proactive time)
- Crucial conversation avoided
- Most important task not started
- Physical health ignored
- Ended day more behind than I started

**Prevention:**
- Block proactive time first
- Schedule the hard conversation
- Start with the most important task
- Protect exercise/movement time
- Set end-of-day checkpoint

### Meetings: Making Them Count

**Normal approach:** What's the agenda? What do we need to discuss?

**Inverted approach:** How would I guarantee this meeting is a waste of time?

**Example waste list:**
- No clear purpose
- Wrong people in room
- No pre-reading done
- Loudest voices dominate
- No decisions made
- No follow-up actions

**Prevention:**
- Clear purpose statement at start
- Verify attendee necessity
- Require pre-reading
- Solicit quieter voices
- Make explicit decisions
- Close with actions and owners

### Emails: Communicating Clearly

**Normal approach:** What do I need to say?

**Inverted approach:** How would I guarantee this email is misunderstood or ignored?

**Example failure list:**
- Unclear ask
- Too long
- Wrong tone
- Missing context
- Buried action item
- Wrong recipients

**Prevention:**
- Lead with the ask
- Keep it short
- Read it as recipient would
- Provide necessary (only necessary) context
- Make action explicit at end
- Choose recipients carefully

### Hiring: Finding the Right Person

**Normal approach:** What skills do we need?

**Inverted approach:** How would I guarantee we hire wrong?

**Example hiring failures:**
- Rush to fill seat
- Settle for "good enough"
- Skip reference checks
- Ignore culture fit
- Oversell role
- Discount red flags

**Prevention:**
- Set timeline that allows quality
- Define "great" not just "acceptable"
- Thorough reference process
- Assess culture explicitly
- Be honest about challenges
- Treat red flags as disqualifying

### Delegating: Empowering Others

**Normal approach:** What should I hand off?

**Inverted approach:** How would I guarantee delegation fails?

**Example failure list:**
- Unclear expectations
- Micromanage the how
- No check-in rhythm
- Withhold necessary context
- Blame for mistakes
- Take back at first difficulty

**Prevention:**
- Define outcomes clearly
- Specify what, not how
- Agree on check-in cadence
- Share context generously
- Accept mistakes as learning
- Support through challenges

### Feedback: Developing People

**Normal approach:** What should this person improve?

**Inverted approach:** How would I guarantee this feedback is useless or harmful?

**Example failure list:**
- Vague generalities
- Sandwich between false praise
- Public delivery
- Personal not behavioral
- No examples
- One-way monologue

**Prevention:**
- Specific and concrete
- Direct and honest
- Private and safe
- Focus on behavior
- Give examples
- Dialogue not lecture

## Building the Daily Inversion Habit

### The 30-Second Inversion

Before any significant action, take 30 seconds:

1. **State the action:** "I'm about to [X]"
2. **Invert:** "This would fail if I [Y]"
3. **Check:** "Am I about to do [Y]?"
4. **Prevent:** "To avoid [Y], I'll [Z]"

**Examples:**

**Before a negotiation:**
- "This would fail if I got emotional, didn't listen, or conceded too early"
- "I'll stay calm, listen twice as much as I talk, and take a break before conceding anything significant"

**Before giving feedback:**
- "This would fail if I was vague, defensive, or didn't listen to response"
- "I'll have specific examples ready, stay open to being wrong, and ask for their perspective"

**Before a presentation:**
- "This would fail if I tried to cover too much, read from slides, or didn't engage audience"
- "I'll stick to three key points, use slides as backdrop, and include questions"

### The Evening Inversion

At day's end, take 5 minutes:

1. **What went wrong today?** Where did I fail, even small failures?
2. **What caused it?** What behavior or decision led to that failure?
3. **Inversion check:** If I'd inverted before, would I have seen this coming?
4. **Tomorrow's prevention:** What will I do differently?

**Log format:**

| What Went Wrong | What Caused It | Could Inversion Have Prevented It? | Tomorrow's Prevention |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| | | | |

### The Weekly Inversion Review

Sunday evening or Monday morning:

1. **Review the week's failures** (from evening logs)
2. **Identify patterns:** What type of failure recurs?
3. **Systemic prevention:** What system would prevent this category of failure?
4. **Update not-to-do list:** Add new items as patterns emerge

## Inversion Decision Checklists

### For Any Decision

Before finalizing:
- [ ] What would make this decision look foolish in hindsight?
- [ ] What am I likely to regret?
- [ ] If this fails, how would it fail?
- [ ] What disconfirming evidence have I considered?
- [ ] What would I advise a friend to avoid in this situation?

### For Commitments

Before saying yes:
- [ ] What would I have to say no to?
- [ ] What's the downside if this goes badly?
- [ ] Why might I regret this?
- [ ] If I could un-commit after, would I?
- [ ] Am I saying yes for the right reasons (not just to please)?

### For Communication

Before sending/speaking:
- [ ] How could this be misunderstood?
- [ ] What would the recipient hear that I'm not intending?
- [ ] What context might they be missing?
- [ ] What might offend or confuse?
- [ ] How would I feel receiving this?

### For Relationships

Before an important interaction:
- [ ] What would damage this relationship?
- [ ] How might I come across in a way I don't intend?
- [ ] What does this person need that I might forget to provide?
- [ ] What mistake did I make last time that I should avoid?
- [ ] What would make them leave this interaction feeling worse?

## Inversion Questions for Common Situations

### When Stuck on a Problem

Instead of: "How do I solve this?"

Ask: "What would make this problem worse? What's keeping it unsolved? What approaches would definitely fail?"

Often, eliminating what doesn't work reveals what might.

### When Considering an Opportunity

Instead of: "What's the upside?"

Ask: "What's the downside? What could go wrong? What's the worst case and could I survive it?"

If you can handle the downside, you can more freely pursue the upside.

### When Building a Team

Instead of: "What skills do we need to add?"

Ask: "What would destroy this team? What types of people would be toxic? What hiring mistakes would we regret?"

Avoiding bad hires is often more important than making great ones.

### When Setting Strategy

Instead of: "What should we do?"

Ask: "What should we definitely not do? What would guarantee failure? What are the stupid mistakes in this space?"

Strategy is as much about what you choose not to do as what you do.

### When Managing Time

Instead of: "What should I add to my schedule?"

Ask: "What should I remove? What activities consistently produce low value? What would I advise someone else to stop doing?"

Time management is often about subtraction, not addition.

## Case Studies in Daily Inversion

### Case 1: The Manager's 1:1

**Without inversion:** Manager walks into 1:1 thinking, "What do we need to discuss?"

**With inversion:** Manager asks, "What would make this 1:1 useless?"
- I dominate the conversation
- We only cover status updates
- Employee's concerns not surfaced
- No coaching or development
- Meeting ends without clarity on next steps

**The inverted 1:1:**
- Manager listens more than talks
- Status updates are done async; this is for deeper topics
- Explicit ask: "What's on your mind that I should know?"
- Coaching question: "What are you learning/struggling with?"
- Explicit close: "What are your priorities until next time?"

### Case 2: The Difficult Conversation

**Without inversion:** Leader prepares talking points for performance conversation.

**With inversion:** Leader asks, "What would make this conversation damaging?"
- Employee feels ambushed
- Feedback is vague or personal
- No opportunity for their perspective
- Leaves unclear about expectations
- Damages rather than improves relationship

**The inverted conversation:**
- Prior heads-up about topic
- Specific, behavioral, documented examples
- Ask for their view first
- Clear expectations and support offered
- Explicit care for the person and the relationship

### Case 3: The New Initiative

**Without inversion:** Team excitedly launches new project.

**With inversion:** Team asks, "What would make this initiative fail?"
- Unclear success criteria
- Wrong people involved (or missing key people)
- Dependencies not mapped
- No executive sponsorship
- Competes with existing priorities

**The inverted launch:**
- Clear metrics for success defined upfront
- Right team assembled, gaps identified
- Dependencies mapped and owners assigned
- Executive sponsor committed
- Integration with priorities explicitly addressed

## Making Inversion Automatic

### The Inversion Trigger

Create a mental trigger that prompts inversion:

**Whenever you think:** "I should..."
**Automatically ask:** "What should I avoid?"

**Whenever you think:** "This will work because..."
**Automatically ask:** "How could this fail?"

**Whenever you think:** "The best approach is..."
**Automatically ask:** "What's the worst approach so I can avoid it?"

### Inversion as Identity

Beyond a technique, inversion becomes a way of being:

- "I'm the kind of person who considers how things could fail"
- "I'm the kind of leader who asks about downsides, not just upsides"
- "I'm the kind of thinker who values what to avoid as much as what to pursue"

When inversion is identity, it's automatic.

## Reflection Questions

1. What's a daily situation where inversion would improve your performance? What would it look like?

2. What regular failure could a 30-second inversion have prevented?

3. What belongs on your daily not-to-do list that isn't there?

4. What habit would you like to install where you automatically ask, "What would fail here?"

5. How can you make inversion as natural as planning?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "The best thing that can happen to you in life is to have a good habit. The worst thing is to have a bad one." — Munger paraphrasing Ben Franklin

Daily inversion builds the habit of better thinking. Over time, it becomes the lens through which you see every decision.

## Tomorrow's Preview

**Day 7** integrates the week's inversion lessons. We'll synthesize backward thinking, stupidity avoidance, pre-mortems, enemy thinking, goal inversion, and daily application into a complete mental toolkit.
