# Day 3: Disliking/Hating Tendency

**Week 4 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger**

> "We also ignore virtues in the things and people we dislike."

## The Core Insight

Just as we distort reality to favor those we like, we distort reality to disfavor those we dislike. This is the **Disliking/Hating Tendency**—and it may be even more dangerous than its counterpart.

When we dislike someone or something, we:
- Overlook their genuine virtues and contributions
- Attribute malicious motives to neutral actions
- Dismiss valid ideas simply because of their source
- Find confirmation for our negative view in ambiguous information

This bias can blind us to valuable perspectives, create toxic dynamics, and cause us to underestimate competitors.

## The Mechanisms of Disliking Bias

### Mechanism 1: Virtue Blindness

The mirror of fault blindness in liking bias. We literally cannot see good qualities in people we dislike.

**In business:**
- Missing valuable insights from disliked colleagues
- Dismissing good strategies from disliked competitors
- Overlooking talent in people who rub us wrong

### Mechanism 2: Hostile Attribution

When someone we dislike does something ambiguous, we assume negative intent.

**In business:**
- "They said that to undermine me"
- "That proposal is designed to make me look bad"
- "They're doing this because they're petty"

### Mechanism 3: Confirmation of Negativity

We seek and remember information that confirms our negative view while ignoring contradicting evidence.

**In business:**
- Every mistake confirms they're incompetent
- Every success is luck or manipulation
- Evidence of virtue doesn't register

### Mechanism 4: Negative Halo

The opposite of the positive halo effect. One disliked quality spreads to everything.

**In business:**
- Someone's annoying communication style makes their work seem poor
- A competitor's arrogant CEO makes their products seem inferior
- Disliking someone's personality makes their ideas seem wrong

---

## Why This Bias Is Particularly Dangerous

### Reason 1: We Miss Important Information

Some of the most valuable insights come from people we don't like. If we dismiss sources based on feeling, we blind ourselves.

### Reason 2: We Create Enemies

Visible dislike creates reciprocal dislike. This escalates into conflict that damages everyone.

### Reason 3: We Underestimate Competition

Disliking competitors leads to underestimating them. This creates strategic blindspots.

### Reason 4: We Build Toxic Cultures

When leaders openly dislike people, it poisons team dynamics. Others sense it and mirror it.

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Dismissed Colleague

A CEO disliked his VP of Engineering—found him abrasive and hard to communicate with. When the VP raised concerns about technical debt, the CEO dismissed them as pessimism and obstruction.

**The result:** Technical problems the VP had warned about eventually caused a major outage. The CEO's dislike had made him deaf to valid warnings.

**The lesson:** Disliking someone doesn't make them wrong.

### Case 2: The Underestimated Competitor

A company's leadership deeply disliked a competitor's culture and CEO. They mocked their approach and dismissed their strategy.

**The result:** The disliked competitor executed brilliantly while the company laughed. By the time they took the threat seriously, market share was lost.

**The lesson:** Dislike creates dangerous underestimation.

### Case 3: The Sabotaged Merger

Two companies merged. Executives from each side disliked each other—culture clashes, historical rivalry, personality conflicts.

**The result:** Dislike led each side to dismiss the other's expertise. Integration failed not because strategies were wrong, but because dislike prevented learning from each other.

**The lesson:** Dislike can destroy value even when objective logic supports collaboration.

---

## The Most Dangerous Form: Contempt

When dislike hardens into contempt, it becomes particularly destructive.

**Signs of contempt:**
- Eye-rolling and dismissive gestures
- Sarcasm about the person or their work
- Refusal to engage seriously with their ideas
- Speaking about them mockingly to others

**Why contempt is worse:**
- It's highly visible and creates reciprocal hostility
- It completely shuts down information flow
- It destroys any possibility of productive relationship
- It spreads toxicity to teams

## Interacting with Other Biases

### Dislike + Incentive Misalignment

When you dislike someone AND their incentives differ from yours, you dismiss everything they say—even when they're right.

**The danger:** Sometimes disliked people with different incentives have valuable perspectives precisely because of their different viewpoint.

### Dislike + Circle of Competence

Disliking someone makes you dismiss their expertise, even when it's genuine.

**The danger:** You lose access to surrogate competence because you can't separate feelings from capability.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: The Forced Learning Exercise

Identify someone or something you dislike (person, competitor, approach).

Force yourself to:
1. List three things they do genuinely well
2. Identify what you could learn from them
3. Articulate their perspective charitably
4. Find evidence for their virtues (not just their faults)

Notice your resistance. That resistance is the bias at work.

### Application 2: The Source-Blind Evaluation

When evaluating ideas, consider implementing source-blind evaluation where possible.

- Written proposals without names attached
- Ideas presented by neutral parties
- Focus on content, not presenter

This removes the opportunity for dislike to distort evaluation.

### Application 3: Watch Your Language

Monitor how you talk about people and companies you dislike:
- Do you dismiss rather than engage?
- Do you mock rather than analyze?
- Do you attribute malice to what might be incompetence or different priorities?

Language shapes thought. Dismissive language reinforces dismissive thinking.

### Application 4: Competitive Analysis Without Emotion

For competitors you dislike:
1. Describe their strategy as charitably as possible
2. Explain why their approach might work
3. Identify their genuine strengths
4. Consider what you'd do if you ran their company

This forced perspective-taking counteracts dislike bias in competitive analysis.

## Managing Dislike When It's Warranted

Sometimes dislike is appropriate. Some people are genuinely problematic. Some competitors do behave unethically.

**The key distinction:**
- Appropriate: Recognizing genuine problems while remaining open to virtues
- Biased: Assuming all information confirms negativity

**The practice:**
- "I dislike them, AND I'll still evaluate their work objectively"
- "They have real problems, AND they also have real strengths"
- "I find them difficult, AND their ideas might still be right"

---

## The Dislike Escalation Cycle

Dislike tends to escalate:

1. You dislike someone
2. They sense it and reciprocate
3. Negative interactions accumulate
4. Each confirms the other's dislike
5. Relationship becomes toxic

**Breaking the cycle:**
- Recognize your contribution to the dynamic
- Behave neutrally even when feelings are negative
- Focus on objective issues, not personality
- Don't spread negative feelings to others

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Competitor Analysis

Choose a competitor you dislike.

Write a one-page analysis:
- What are they doing right?
- Why might their approach succeed?
- What would you copy if you could?
- What could they teach you?

Notice your resistance to giving them credit.

### Exercise 2: The Charitable Interpretation

Think of someone at work you find difficult.

For their next three actions or statements:
- Write the most charitable interpretation possible
- What if they have good intentions but poor execution?
- What if you're missing context?

### Exercise 3: The Virtue List

For someone you dislike, force yourself to list:
- Three skills they have
- Three contributions they've made
- Three things they might know that you don't

## Reflection Questions

1. Who do you dislike that might have valuable perspectives you're missing?

2. Where might dislike be leading you to underestimate a competitor?

3. What colleague's ideas do you dismiss where you might be biased by personality rather than content?

4. How do you speak about people you dislike? Does your language reinforce your bias?

5. Where has dislike cost you—missed opportunities, failed relationships, strategic blindspots?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "When one is pretending, the entire body revolts." — Anais Nin

Dislike is hard to hide. Others sense it, and it shapes every interaction. Even when you think you're being objective, your dislike leaks through—to them and to yourself.
