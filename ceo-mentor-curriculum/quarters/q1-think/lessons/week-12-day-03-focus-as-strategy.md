# Day 3: Focus as Strategy

**Week 12 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

> "Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing."

## The Core Insight

Focus is not just a tactic—it's a strategy. Concentration of resources on what matters most creates disproportionate results. Dispersed effort across many things creates mediocrity everywhere.

Buffett famously concentrates his investments in a handful of companies, rejecting the conventional wisdom of diversification. He knows what he's doing, so he doesn't need the protection of diversification.

## The Math of Focus

### Concentrated vs. Dispersed Effort

**Dispersed effort:**
- 10 initiatives, 10% each
- Each gets minimal resources
- None achieves excellence
- Results: mediocre across all

**Concentrated effort:**
- 3 initiatives, 33% each
- Each gets meaningful resources
- Excellence becomes possible
- Results: outstanding in what matters

### The Multiplication Effect

**Focus multiplies impact:**
- Attention compounds
- Expertise deepens
- Momentum builds
- Reputation forms
- Competitive advantage develops

**Dispersion divides impact:**
- Attention fragments
- Expertise stays shallow
- Momentum scatters
- No clear reputation
- No competitive advantage

## Why Diversification Is Seductive

### The Safety Illusion

**The argument:**
- "Don't put all eggs in one basket"
- "Spread risk across options"
- "Hedge your bets"

**The reality:**
- Diversification protects against catastrophic failure
- But guarantees mediocre success
- The "safe" choice prevents excellence

### The Ignorance Compensation

**Buffett's point:**
- If you don't know which is best, diversify
- If you DO know, concentrate
- Diversification compensates for ignorance

**The implication:**
- Build knowledge to enable focus
- Focus proves you know what you're doing
- Ignorance requires diversification

### The Activity Illusion

**The appeal of many things:**
- Feels productive
- Looks busy
- Provides options
- Seems strategic

**The reality:**
- Activity isn't progress
- Busy isn't effective
- Options become burdens
- Complexity isn't strategy

## The Focus Disciplines

### Discipline 1: Define What Matters Most

**The question:** If you could only do three things, what would they be?

**The exercise:**
1. List all your activities/priorities
2. Force-rank them
3. Circle the top 3
4. Those are your focus

### Discipline 2: Say No to Good Things

**The challenge:**
- Easy to say no to bad things
- Hard to say no to good things
- Focus requires saying no to good for great

### Discipline 3: Eliminate, Don't Add

**The pattern:**
- When problems arise, we add
- More resources, more processes, more initiatives
- The right response is often subtraction

### Discipline 4: Protect Focus from Drift

**The tendency:**
- Start focused
- Gradually add "just one more thing"
- Focus erodes
- Eventually scattered

**The discipline:**
- Regular focus reviews
- Explicit addition/subtraction
- Vigilance against drift

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Berkshire's Concentrated Portfolio

Buffett concentrates investments:

**The approach:**
- Top 5 positions often = 70%+ of portfolio
- Sometimes a single position = 40%+
- Far fewer holdings than typical investor

**The logic:**
- If it's your best idea, why not put more in it?
- Diversification dilutes your best thinking
- Concentration = confidence

**The result:** Outsized returns on concentrated positions

### Case 2: Amazon's Focus Eras

Amazon focuses intensely on phases:

**Early Amazon:**
- Books only, then books well
- Ignored other categories initially
- Built infrastructure for one thing

**Later Amazon:**
- Added categories one at a time
- Each got focused attention
- AWS got massive internal focus

**The pattern:** Serial focus, not parallel diversification

### Case 3: The Scattered Company

A company that lacked focus:

**The pattern:**
- Too many product lines
- Too many markets
- Too many initiatives
- Resources spread thin

**The result:**
- Mediocre in everything
- No clear competitive advantage
- Eventually overtaken by focused competitors

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: The Forced Prioritization

**List your top 10 priorities:**
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.

**Now circle only 3.** Those are your priorities. The other 7 are not priorities—they're distractions.

### Application 2: Resource Alignment

**Check resource allocation:**

| Priority | % of Resources | Aligned with Importance? |
|----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| #1 | | Y/N |
| #2 | | Y/N |
| #3 | | Y/N |
| Other things | | Should be minimal |

### Application 3: The Elimination List

**What should you stop doing?**

| Activity | Why Still Doing It? | Cost of Continuing | Decision |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| | | | Keep/Stop |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Application 4: The Focus Protection Plan

**How will you protect focus?**

- Regular review frequency:
- Who holds you accountable:
- What triggers require re-evaluation:
- How will you resist drift:

## The Focus Test

### For Any New Initiative

Before adding, ask:
1. Is this one of our top 3 priorities?
2. What will we stop to do this?
3. Is it more important than what we'd stop?
4. Who else could do this?

### For Existing Activities

Regularly ask:
1. Is this still a top 3 priority?
2. What would happen if we stopped?
3. Are we the right ones to do this?
4. Is our effort level appropriate to importance?

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Priority Stack

Stack-rank everything you're doing:
1. From most to least important
2. Draw a line after #3
3. Everything below: question its existence

### Exercise 2: The Time Audit

Track your time for a week:
1. What percentage went to #1 priority?
2. To #2?
3. To #3?
4. To everything else?
5. Is this allocation right?

### Exercise 3: The Subtraction Experiment

Stop doing one thing for a month:
1. Choose something below top 3
2. Stop doing it completely
3. Note what happens
4. Decide if it should return

---

## Reflection Questions

1. What is your core focus? Could you articulate it in one sentence?

2. If you eliminated 50% of your activities, what would remain?

3. Would eliminating the bottom 50% be bad? Or actually better?

4. Are you diversified because you're strategic, or because you can't prioritize?

5. What would change if you focused completely on your top 3?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing."

Do you know what you're doing? If yes, focus relentlessly. If no, build the knowledge to know—then focus.

## Tomorrow's Preview

**Day 4** explores **Protecting White Space**—the importance of unscheduled time for thinking and why busy calendars indicate poor prioritization.
