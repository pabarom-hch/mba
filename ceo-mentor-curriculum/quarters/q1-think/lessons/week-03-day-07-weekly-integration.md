# Day 7: Weekly Integration — The Circle of Competence

**Week 3 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger & Warren Buffett**

> "The most important thing in terms of your circle of competence is not how large the area of it is, but how well you've defined the perimeter."

---

## The Week in Review

This week explored one of Buffett and Munger's most important concepts: knowing what you know and what you don't know.

| Day | Lesson | Core Practice |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Defining Your Circle | Honestly assess where you have deep competence |
| 2 | The Edges | Recognize the dangerous territory just beyond your circle |
| 3 | The Ego Problem | Manage ego's push to pretend competence you don't have |
| 4 | Expanding vs. Respecting | Know when and how to grow your circle appropriately |
| 5 | Surrogate Competence | Leverage others' circles when you can't expand your own |
| 6 | The Humility Dividend | Reap the returns on admitting what you don't know |

## The Complete Circle of Competence Framework

### Part 1: Assessment

**Know your circle:**
- What do you truly understand deeply?
- What's at your edge (dangerous territory)?
- What's clearly outside?

**The honest test:**
- Can you explain it to a novice?
- Can you answer adversarial questions?
- Have you made predictions and tracked accuracy?
- Do you know what you don't know within the domain?

### Part 2: Decision-Making

**Inside your circle:**
- Proceed with confidence
- Trust your judgment
- Take responsibility for outcomes

**At the edge:**
- Proceed with caution
- Seek additional input
- Build in reversibility
- Learn from outcomes

**Outside your circle:**
- Use Buffett's three baskets: In, Out, Too Tough
- Leverage surrogate competence
- Or expand your circle deliberately (if worth the investment)
- Or pass on the opportunity

### Part 3: Building Coverage

**Your own circle:**
- Expand deliberately where strategic
- Invest time (years, not weeks)
- Track progress honestly
- Know when you've arrived

**Team circles:**
- Map your team's competencies
- Identify gaps
- Hire/develop/consult to cover
- Build redundancy for critical domains

**Advisory network:**
- Identify surrogates for each domain outside your circle
- Learn to evaluate expert quality
- Ask good questions
- Synthesize multiple perspectives

### Part 4: Humility Practice

**Daily:**
- Say "I don't know" when it's true
- Lead with questions outside your circle
- Thank people who challenge you

**Ongoing:**
- Seek disconfirming evidence
- Celebrate being proven wrong
- Model intellectual humility

## The CEO's Circle of Competence Checklist

### For Major Decisions

Before committing:

- [ ] Is this decision inside my circle?
- [ ] If edge or outside, who are my surrogates?
- [ ] Have I asked good questions of experts?
- [ ] Have I sought disconfirming perspectives?
- [ ] Is there pressure (ego, urgency, social) pushing me beyond my circle?
- [ ] What would Buffett do with this in his three baskets?

### For Team Design

- [ ] What domains must be covered for business success?
- [ ] Who covers each domain?
- [ ] Where are there gaps?
- [ ] Where is coverage single-threaded (risk)?
- [ ] What's my plan for gaps?

### For Personal Development

- [ ] What domains should I expand into?
- [ ] What's my learning plan?
- [ ] How will I track progress?
- [ ] What domains should I explicitly not expand (delegate instead)?

## Warning Signs Review

### You're Operating Outside Your Circle When:

- You use jargon without being able to define terms simply
- Your confidence exceeds your prediction accuracy
- You can't answer "why" more than two levels deep
- You feel excited by novelty rather than understanding
- You defer to authority without evaluating reasoning
- You've never made mistakes in this domain (never really tested)

### Ego Is Driving When:

- You feel defensive when competence is questioned
- You're uncomfortable saying "I don't know"
- You give confident answers on topics you've barely studied
- You avoid situations where ignorance might be exposed
- You take credit for outcomes that were luck

### You're Using Surrogates Well When:

- You've identified true experts (not just confident people)
- You evaluate their quality (track record, peer respect)
- You ask good questions (assumptions, ranges, alternatives)
- You synthesize multiple perspectives
- You maintain healthy skepticism (trust but verify)

## Connecting to Previous Weeks

### Circle of Competence + Mental Models (Week 1)

Your mental models form part of your circle:
- Models you understand deeply are inside
- Models you know about but can't apply are at the edge
- The latticework expands your circle over time

### Circle of Competence + Inversion (Week 2)

Inversion reveals circle boundaries:
- "What would guarantee I fail here?" often reveals where you're outside your circle
- Pre-mortems surface competence gaps
- The smart enemy exploits areas outside your circle

## Reflection Questions

1. How has your understanding of your own competence changed this week?

2. Where did you recognize you were operating outside your circle?

3. What ego patterns did you notice in yourself?

4. How effective is your current surrogate competence network?

5. What will you do differently going forward?

## Week 3 Summary

Circle of competence is about honest self-assessment:

**The core idea:**
- Know what you truly understand
- Know where your competence ends
- Operate inside, with caution at edges, and with humility outside

**The practical application:**
- Build a team whose combined circles cover business needs
- Develop surrogate competence for domains outside your circle
- Expand deliberately where strategic, delegate otherwise
- Practice intellectual humility—it's a competitive advantage

**The paradox:**
- The best leaders are confident about what they know and humble about what they don't
- Admitting limits demonstrates strength, not weakness
- The smaller your ego about competence, the larger your actual competence becomes
