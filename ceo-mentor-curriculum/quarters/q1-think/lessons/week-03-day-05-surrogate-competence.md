# Day 5: Surrogate Competence

**Week 3 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger & Warren Buffett**

> "It's not about having a large circle of competence, but knowing where the perimeter lies."

## The Core Insight

You don't need every competency inside your own circle. You need access to competency—through people whose circles cover what yours doesn't.

**Surrogate competence** is the ability to leverage others' expertise effectively. It's a meta-competence: knowing how to identify, evaluate, and work with experts in domains you don't personally master.

For CEOs, surrogate competence may be as important as direct competence.

---

## Why Surrogate Competence Matters

### The Coverage Problem

Your circle can never cover everything a business needs:
- Technical domains (engineering, data science, legal)
- Functional expertise (finance, marketing, operations)
- Industry knowledge (regulations, relationships, dynamics)
- Specialized skills (negotiation, design, research)

You must leverage others or fail.

### The Time Problem

Even if you could expand your circle to cover everything, you don't have time:
- Genuine competence takes years
- You have a business to run
- The world is changing faster than you can learn

Surrogate competence is more efficient than personal expansion.

### The Focus Problem

Trying to be competent in everything dilutes you:
- Your greatest value is in your deepest competencies
- Time spent expanding broadly is time not spent deepening core

Focus on your core, leverage surrogates for the rest.

## Building Surrogate Competence

### Competency 1: Identifying Real Experts

Not everyone claiming expertise has it. Learn to distinguish:

**True experts:**
- Can explain complex things simply
- Acknowledge what they don't know
- Have track record of prediction/outcomes
- Are respected by other experts
- Update beliefs with evidence

**False experts:**
- Rely on jargon and complexity
- Claim certainty about everything
- Have credentials but no track record
- Are controversial among true experts
- Resist updating beliefs

### Competency 2: Evaluating Expert Quality

Since you're outside the circle, how do you evaluate?

**Reference checking:**
- Ask other experts: "Who's the best in this field?"
- The same names come up repeatedly
- Experts respect other experts

**Track record:**
- What have they predicted or built?
- What were the outcomes?
- What mistakes did they make and learn from?

**Explanation quality:**
- Can they explain it to you understandably?
- Do they welcome your questions?
- Do they acknowledge uncertainty?

**Skin in the game:**
- What do they stand to gain/lose from their advice?
- Are their incentives aligned with yours?
- Are they betting on their own advice?

### Competency 3: Asking Good Questions

Even outside your circle, you can ask good questions:

**Boundary questions:**
- "What do you know for certain vs. what are you estimating?"
- "What would change your recommendation?"
- "What's the range of possible outcomes?"

**Assumption questions:**
- "What has to be true for this to work?"
- "What could go wrong?"
- "What are you assuming about the environment?"

**Track record questions:**
- "When have you been wrong about something like this?"
- "What predictions have you made, and how did they turn out?"
- "What would you do differently with hindsight?"

**Alternative questions:**
- "Who disagrees with you, and why?"
- "What would a skeptic say?"
- "What's the alternative approach, and why not that?"

### Competency 4: Synthesizing Multiple Perspectives

One expert is an opinion. Multiple experts are data.

**When experts agree:** Higher confidence (but still not certainty)

**When experts disagree:**
- Understand why
- What are the underlying assumptions?
- What would resolve the disagreement?

**When experts are uncertain:**
- That's information too
- The domain may be unpredictable
- Adjust your confidence accordingly

## Mapping Your Team's Circles

### The Team Competence Inventory

For each critical domain, map who covers it:

| Domain | Person | Their Competence Level | Gap? |
|--------|--------|------------------------|------|
| Strategy | | | |
| Finance | | | |
| Technology | | | |
| Sales | | | |
| Marketing | | | |
| Operations | | | |
| Legal | | | |
| HR/Talent | | | |
| Industry expertise | | | |

### Finding Gaps

Where circles don't overlap critical domains:
- No one has deep competence
- Or only one person does (risk)
- Or competence is at edge, not inside

These are vulnerabilities.

### Building Coverage

For each gap:
1. **Hire:** Add someone whose circle covers it
2. **Develop:** Help existing team expand their circles
3. **Consult:** Use outside experts
4. **Partner:** Work with organizations that have the competence

## The Surrogate Relationship

### Making It Work

Effective use of surrogates requires:

**Trust:** They must believe you'll listen
**Access:** They must have access to information they need
**Authority:** They must have power to act within their domain
**Accountability:** They must own outcomes

### Common Failure Modes

**Micromanaging:** You override their expertise
**Ignoring:** You don't leverage them enough
**False consensus:** You seek agreement, not expertise
**Poor selection:** You chose the wrong surrogates

### The Ideal Dynamic

- You understand enough to ask good questions
- They understand enough to give complete answers
- You respect their competence; they respect your role
- Decisions are made with appropriate input
- Accountability is clear

---

## When Surrogate Competence Isn't Enough

### High-Stakes Irreversible Decisions

When mistakes are catastrophic and irreversible:
- Surrogate competence may not be enough
- You may need to expand your own circle
- Or get multiple independent surrogates

### Judgment Calls

When the decision requires weighing factors across domains:
- Surrogates can inform each domain
- But the synthesis is yours
- This requires enough understanding to integrate

### Core to Your Strategy

If a domain is central to competitive advantage:
- You may need deeper personal understanding
- "Surrogate competence" in your strategic core is risky
- Consider whether this should be inside your circle

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Buffett and Insurance

Buffett is not an insurance actuary. But insurance is core to Berkshire Hathaway.

**His approach:**
- Developed enough understanding to ask good questions
- Hired deep experts (Ajit Jain and others)
- Trusted them within their domains
- Maintained ability to evaluate at high level

**The balance:** He's not inside the circle on actuarial details, but he's developed surrogate competence to leverage those who are.

### Case 2: The Non-Technical CEO

A non-technical CEO ran a software company. Technology was core, but not her expertise.

**Her approach:**
- Hired exceptional CTO (surrogate competence)
- Learned enough to ask good questions (boundary competence)
- Built multiple technology advisors for triangulation
- Tracked predictions: Did what CTO said would happen, happen?

**The outcome:** Successful technology decisions without personal technical expertise.

### Case 3: The Failed Surrogate Relationship

A CEO hired a CFO but never trusted their judgment.

**The problem:**
- Micromanaged financial decisions
- Sought approval rather than advice
- Overrode expert judgment with intuition

**The outcome:** CFO quit. Financial mistakes accumulated. CEO's lack of surrogate competence cost the company.

## Building Your Advisory Network

Beyond your team, build a network of surrogates:

### Formal Advisors
- Board members with specific expertise
- Advisory board members
- Retained consultants

### Informal Network
- Industry peers you can call
- Former colleagues with relevant expertise
- Mentors who've faced similar challenges

### Expert Sources
- Analysts who cover your space
- Academics who study your domain
- Authors whose work you respect

### For Each Domain Outside Your Circle

Who is your surrogate? If no one, you have a vulnerability.

| Domain | Primary Surrogate | Backup | Gap? |
|--------|------------------|--------|------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Team Circle Mapping

Create a visual map of your team's circles of competence:
- Draw a circle for each team member
- Mark their areas of deep competence
- Identify overlaps and gaps

### Exercise 2: The Surrogate Interview

For a domain outside your circle, interview an expert:
1. What do they know for certain?
2. What are they uncertain about?
3. Who do they consider experts?
4. What question should you be asking that you're not?

### Exercise 3: The Gap Analysis

For each critical domain:
- Who covers it?
- How strong is that coverage?
- What's the backup if they're wrong or leave?
- What would you do if you had no surrogate?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Who on your team covers domains outside your circle? How strong is that coverage?

2. How effective are you at evaluating experts in domains you don't understand?

3. What critical domain has no good surrogate coverage?

4. When have you failed to leverage surrogate competence effectively?

5. What questions should you be asking your surrogates that you're not?
