# Day 5: Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency

**Week 4 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger**

> "The brain conserves programming space by being reluctant to change."

## The Core Insight

Once we've formed an opinion, made a commitment, or chosen a path, we resist changing it—even when we should. This is the **Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency**, and it operates powerfully below conscious awareness.

This bias causes us to:
- Defend positions long after evidence turns against them
- Feel attached to approaches simply because we chose them
- Ignore or rationalize information that contradicts our commitments
- Throw good resources after bad (sunk cost fallacy)

It's the reason organizations persist with failing strategies, leaders cling to wrong decisions, and change is so hard.

---

## Why We Resist Inconsistency

### The Cognitive Efficiency Argument

Munger's insight: the brain "conserves programming space." Every decision takes mental energy. If we reconsidered everything constantly, we'd be paralyzed. So the brain defaults to consistency—stick with what you've decided.

This efficiency comes with a cost: we stick with wrong decisions too.

### The Identity Investment Argument

Our commitments become part of our identity. Changing them feels like changing ourselves—which threatens ego integrity.

**The pattern:**
- "I'm the kind of leader who..."
- "We're the kind of company that..."
- "I've always believed..."

Challenging these feels like an attack on identity, not just ideas.

### The Social Consistency Argument

Others expect us to be consistent. Changing positions invites accusations of flip-flopping, weakness, or unreliability. Social pressure reinforces individual tendency.

## How Inconsistency-Avoidance Operates

### Mechanism 1: Sunk Cost Attachment

We continue investing in failing projects because we've already invested.

**The logic (flawed):** "We've put so much in, we can't stop now."

**The reality:** Past costs are irrelevant to future decisions. Only future costs and benefits matter.

### Mechanism 2: Confirmation Seeking

Once committed, we seek information that confirms our choice and avoid information that challenges it.

**The pattern:**
- Read articles that support our strategy
- Dismiss critics as uninformed
- Surround ourselves with agreement
- Interpret ambiguous data favorably

### Mechanism 3: Rationalization

When confronted with contradicting evidence, we generate explanations that preserve our position.

**The pattern:**
- "That failure was due to external factors"
- "The strategy is right; execution was wrong"
- "The data is misleading"
- "It would have worked except for..."

### Mechanism 4: Position Hardening

The more we defend a position, the more committed we become. Public defense intensifies private belief.

**The pattern:**
- You argue for something
- You invest ego in being right
- You become more certain
- Counter-evidence feels like attack

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Zombie Project

A tech company had a product that wasn't working. Metrics were poor. Customer feedback was negative. But leadership had publicly committed to the product, hired a large team, and made it central to strategy.

**What happened:** The project continued for two years past its obvious failure point. Leadership rationalized: market timing, competitor moves, team issues—anything but admitting the core idea was wrong.

**The cost:** Massive resources wasted, talent demoralized, opportunity cost of better uses.

**The lesson:** Commitment created blindness. The larger the commitment, the harder to see clearly.

### Case 2: The Acquisition Defense

A CEO led an acquisition that wasn't delivering expected results. Board members raised concerns. Data showed underperformance.

**The response:** Rather than acknowledge problems, the CEO generated explanations: integration challenges, market conditions, timeline too short. He increased investment to "make it work."

**The result:** Years later, the acquisition was written off at massive loss. Earlier acknowledgment would have saved resources and enabled faster pivot.

**The lesson:** Personal identification with decisions makes rational evaluation almost impossible.

### Case 3: The Strategy Lock

A company committed to a "mobile-first" strategy when the CEO was certain mobile was the future. Two years later, their particular customer base still preferred desktop, and mobile investments weren't paying off.

**The response:** Rather than adjusting, leadership doubled down: "We're early; customers will shift." They modified the question from "Is our strategy right?" to "How do we execute better?"

**The lesson:** Strategy commitment can prevent the very strategic reassessment that's needed.

## The Sunk Cost Trap: A Deeper Look

The most common manifestation of inconsistency-avoidance is the sunk cost fallacy.

### The Sunk Cost Error

**Flawed thinking:** "We've invested $5 million. If we stop now, that's wasted."

**Correct thinking:** "The $5 million is gone regardless. The question is: Given where we are now, what's the best use of the next dollar?"

### Why It Persists

Sunk costs feel like they should matter because:
- Abandoning them admits the investment was wrong
- Social accountability ("What happened to that $5 million?")
- Difficulty separating past decisions from future choices
- Hope that persistence will redeem the investment

### The Rescue Fallacy

Often sunk cost thinking takes this form:
- "If we just invest a bit more, we can save the previous investment"
- "We're too far in to quit"
- "Stopping now wastes everything"

This leads to ever-increasing commitment to failing paths.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: The Sacred Cow Hunt

Regularly identify "things we do because we've always done them":
- Processes that continue without evaluation
- Strategies that are defended but not challenged
- Commitments that have become identity

**Practice:** Once a quarter, ask: "If we were starting fresh today, would we choose this?" If no, why are you continuing?

### Application 2: The Kill Criteria

Before any major commitment, establish explicit failure criteria:
- "We'll reconsider if we don't see X by date Y"
- "We'll exit if metric Z falls below threshold"
- "We'll reassess after N months regardless of position"

Writing these down before commitment makes it easier to follow through later.

### Application 3: Separate Identity from Decisions

Practice viewing decisions as experiments, not expressions of identity:
- "I think X" → "I'm currently testing X"
- "We are a company that..." → "We're currently pursuing..."
- "I believe..." → "My current hypothesis is..."

This language creates psychological distance that enables updating.

### Application 4: Celebrate Pivots

Create cultural rewards for changing course appropriately:
- Praise people who identify needed pivots
- Treat course corrections as wisdom, not weakness
- Share stories of successful strategic changes
- Model changing your own mind publicly

## Distinguishing Persistence from Stubbornness

Not all consistency is bias. Sometimes persistence is exactly right.

**Healthy persistence:**
- Based on fresh assessment that strategy is still correct
- Acknowledges challenges while believing they're surmountable
- Willing to specify what would trigger reconsideration
- Open to disconfirming evidence even while continuing

**Biased stubbornness:**
- Based on commitment to past decisions
- Rationalizes problems rather than evaluating them
- Cannot articulate what would trigger change
- Dismisses or avoids disconfirming evidence

**The test:** Are you continuing because you've evaluated and believe it's right, or because you've committed and can't let go?

## Interacting with Other Biases

### Inconsistency-Avoidance + Doubt-Avoidance

Doubt-avoidance rushes you to conclusions; inconsistency-avoidance keeps you there. Together, they're a trap: quick to commit, slow to update.

### Inconsistency-Avoidance + Liking/Disliking

Once you've decided you like or dislike something, inconsistency-avoidance protects that judgment. First impressions become entrenched.

### Inconsistency-Avoidance + Social Proof

If you've taken a public position that others support, changing feels like betraying the group—intensifying resistance.

## Techniques for Appropriate Updating

### Technique 1: The Fresh Eyes Exercise

Regularly ask: "If a new CEO walked in tomorrow, what would they change immediately?" Then ask why you're not changing it.

### Technique 2: The Pre-Committed Review

Schedule decision reviews before you make the decision. "In 6 months, we'll reassess X regardless of current position."

### Technique 3: The Red Team

Assign people to argue against your positions. Their job is to find problems, not to agree. Make disagreement safe and expected.

### Technique 4: The Sunk Cost Question

For any resource decision: "Ignore what we've spent. Given where we are now, is this the best use of the next increment?"

## Practical Exercise

### The Commitment Inventory

List five significant commitments you or your organization are currently pursuing:

For each:
1. When did you commit?
2. What evidence since then supports continuing?
3. What evidence since then suggests reconsidering?
4. How do you feel about reconsidering? (Resistance = potential bias)
5. If you were starting fresh, would you make this commitment?
6. What would have to happen for you to change course?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. What positions are you defending past their expiration date?

2. Where have sunk costs trapped you in continued investment?

3. What would you do differently if you joined your company today as a new leader?

4. How comfortable are you changing your mind publicly? What makes it hard?

5. What "sacred cows" in your organization continue only because of past commitment?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?" — Often attributed to John Maynard Keynes

The ability to update beliefs and strategies when evidence warrants is a competitive advantage. Consistency for its own sake is a trap.
