**Week 9 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

> "In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats."

## The Week in Review

This week explored economic moats—the sustainable competitive advantages that protect businesses from competition and allow them to earn superior returns over time.

| Day | Topic | Core Concept |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Identifying Your Moat | Six moat types; know which you have |
| 2 | Moat Erosion | Capitalism guarantees assault; moats must be defended |
| 3 | Widening the Moat | Best defense is a moat that grows over time |
| 4 | Brand as Moat | Stored trust that enables premium and loyalty |
| 5 | Switching Costs | When leaving is painful, customers stay |
| 6 | Moats That Strengthen | Time as friend of the wonderful business |

## The Complete Moat Framework

### The Six Moat Types

**1. Brand/Reputation**
- Customer trust that allows premium pricing
- Accumulated through consistent quality and experience
- Widened through continued investment and consistency

**2. Network Effects**
- Value increases with each user
- Self-reinforcing growth
- Widened by adding high-value nodes

**3. Cost Advantages**
- Structural ability to produce cheaper
- Scale, process, or location-based
- Widened through volume and efficiency gains

**4. Switching Costs**
- Pain of changing to competitor
- Built on integration, learning, data, and ecosystem
- Widened through deeper embedding over time

**5. Intangible Assets**
- Patents, licenses, proprietary technology
- Legal protection from competition
- Widened through continued innovation

**6. Efficient Scale**
- Market only supports limited players
- Entry uneconomic for newcomers
- Widened by capturing more of limited market

### The Moat Assessment

**Questions to ask:**
- What protects your business from competition?
- Could a well-funded competitor replicate your advantage in 5 years?
- Is your moat widening, stable, or narrowing?
- Is time your friend or enemy?
- Do your moats reinforce each other?

## The Moat Audit

### Part 1: Current Moat Assessment

**Rate your moats (1-10):**

| Moat Type | Strength | Trend | Time Dynamic |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------------|
| Brand/Reputation | | ↑/→/↓ | Friend/Enemy |
| Network Effects | | ↑/→/↓ | Friend/Enemy |
| Cost Advantages | | ↑/→/↓ | Friend/Enemy |
| Switching Costs | | ↑/→/↓ | Friend/Enemy |
| Intangible Assets | | ↑/→/↓ | Friend/Enemy |
| Efficient Scale | | ↑/→/↓ | Friend/Enemy |

### Part 2: Threat Assessment

**Identify primary threats to each moat:**

| Moat Type | Top Threat | Severity | Timeline |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Part 3: Widening Investment Analysis

**Current investments in moat widening:**

| Investment | Moat Type Affected | Impact | Adequacy |
|------------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| | | | Sufficient/Insufficient |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Investments you should make but aren't:**

| Potential Investment | Moat Type | Why Not Making It? |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Part 4: Moat Reinforcement

**Do your moats reinforce each other?**

Draw the connections:
```
[Moat 1] ←→ [Moat 2]
    ↑           ↑
    └───────────┘
         ↑
     [Moat 3]
```

**What additional moats would reinforce your existing ones?**

## Integrating with Previous Weeks

### Moats + Mental Models (Week 1)

Multiple models apply to moat thinking:
- **Long-term thinking:** Moats matter over decades
- **Compound effects:** The best moats compound
- **Opportunity cost:** Investment in moat-widening vs. alternatives

### Moats + Inversion (Week 2)

Inversion reveals moat vulnerabilities:
- "What would destroy our moat?" identifies threats
- "How would a competitor attack?" reveals weaknesses
- Pre-mortems on moat failure guide defense

### Moats + Circle of Competence (Week 3)

Competence and moats interact:
- Build moats within your circle of competence
- Your competence can be a moat itself
- Expanding into areas without moat potential is dangerous

### Moats + Cognitive Biases (Weeks 4-6)

Biases affect moat assessment:
- **Overconfidence:** Believing moat is wider than it is
- **Status quo:** Assuming moat will persist without investment
- **Confirmation bias:** Ignoring evidence of erosion
- **Sunk cost:** Defending moats that are already lost

### Moats + Long-Term Thinking (Week 7)

Long-term perspective is essential:
- Moats reveal themselves over decades
- Short-term metrics often miss moat erosion
- Investment in moats requires patience

### Moats + Owner Mentality (Week 8)

Owners invest in moats:
- Renters harvest moats; owners widen them
- Owner perspective prioritizes long-term moat health
- Capital allocation should favor moat-widening

## The Moat Strategy

### The CEO's Moat Responsibilities

**1. Know your moat:**
- Clearly articulate what protects you
- Understand its durability
- Track its trajectory

**2. Defend your moat:**
- Monitor threats continuously
- Invest in maintenance
- Respond to erosion early

**3. Widen your moat:**
- Allocate resources to moat-widening
- Prioritize long-term position over short-term profits
- Build compounding effects

**4. Stack multiple moats:**
- Don't rely on single moat
- Build moats that reinforce each other
- Diversify competitive advantages

### The Warning Signs

**Moat erosion indicators:**
- Price pressure increasing
- Customer switching increasing
- New entrants succeeding
- Technology making advantage obsolete
- Brand perception declining
- Scale advantages diminishing

**When you see these, act fast.** Early response options are greater than late ones.

2. What's the most important insight from this week about your competitive position?

3. Are you investing enough in moat-widening activities?

4. What threat to your moat most concerns you now?

5. What will you do differently as a result of this week?

## Week 9 Summary

Economic moats are the sustainable competitive advantages that protect businesses from competition:

**The core insight:** A business without a moat will see its advantages eroded by competition. A business with a wide, deepening moat can earn superior returns for decades.

**The practical application:**
- Know your moat type and strength
- Monitor for erosion continuously
- Invest in widening, not just defending
- Ensure time is your friend
- Stack multiple reinforcing moats

**The transformation:** Once you think in terms of moats, strategy becomes clearer. The questions shift from "How do we grow?" to "How do we protect and widen our competitive advantage?" This is the difference between running on a treadmill and building a fortress.

## Key Quote for the Week

> "In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats."

Your job as CEO is to be the honest lord in charge of the castle. Know your moat. Defend it. Widen it. Make time your friend.

## Next Week Preview

**Week 10: Margin of Safety** — Buffett's concept borrowed from Ben Graham. What is the margin between what you pay and what something is worth? How do you build safety into decisions? How do you protect against the unknown?
