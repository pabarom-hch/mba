## The Core Insight

After three weeks studying 25 causes of human misjudgment, the question becomes: What do you do about them?

You can't eliminate biases—they're wired into human cognition. But you can:
1. Recognize when they're operating
2. Design systems that counteract them
3. Create cultures where bias-checking is normal
4. Build in structural protections

This day focuses on practical system design for better decision-making.

## The Design Principle

**Bias awareness alone isn't enough.**

Knowing about biases improves judgment modestly. But under pressure, time constraints, or emotional engagement, awareness fails. We need systems that work even when our awareness doesn't.

**The solution: External structure.**

Build processes and systems that compensate for predictable human error, so you don't rely on willpower alone.

## System Design Principles

### Principle 1: Make Bias Visible

Create mechanisms that surface bias so it can be addressed.

**Examples:**
- Written decision records with reasoning
- Required devil's advocate roles
- Bias checklists before major decisions
- Post-decision reviews that identify bias patterns

### Principle 2: Introduce Friction

Slow down where speed enables bias.

**Examples:**
- Mandatory waiting periods for major decisions
- Multiple approval layers for certain actions
- Required information gathering before deciding
- Cooling-off periods after emotional events

### Principle 3: Diversify Input

One perspective magnifies individual biases. Multiple perspectives create correction.

**Examples:**
- Required input from multiple stakeholders
- Anonymous feedback collection
- External advisors with different viewpoints
- Red team / blue team exercises

### Principle 4: Create Accountability

Knowing you'll be reviewed changes how you decide.

**Examples:**
- Decision documentation requirements
- Prediction tracking with outcomes
- Public commitment records
- Post-mortems for significant failures

## Systems for Specific Biases

### For Incentive Distortion

**Problem:** People's advice reflects their incentives
**System:**
- Require incentive disclosure for advisors
- Separate recommenders from implementers
- Second opinions from parties with different incentives
- Track advisor recommendations vs. outcomes

### For Liking/Disliking Bias

**Problem:** Feelings about people distort evaluation of their ideas
**System:**
- Blind evaluation where possible
- Written proposals before knowing source
- Scoring rubrics that separate content from presenter
- Diverse evaluators with different relationships

### For Commitment/Consistency Bias

**Problem:** We defend past decisions rather than updating
**System:**
- Pre-commitment to review triggers
- Fresh-start framing for major reviews
- External reviewers without prior commitment
- Kill criteria set before investment

### For Social Proof

**Problem:** We follow crowds even when crowds are wrong
**System:**
- Collect opinions before discussion
- Reward independent thinking
- Seek contrarian perspectives actively
- Track whether consensus correlated with outcomes

### For Authority Bias

**Problem:** We defer to authority even when wrong
**System:**
- Junior speaks first
- Anonymous input mechanisms
- Explicit encouragement of pushback
- Separate idea evaluation from idea source

### For Availability Bias

**Problem:** We overweight vivid and recent information
**System:**
- Base rate requirements for decisions
- Systematic data collection beyond anecdotes
- Historical pattern analysis
- External benchmarks

### For Over-Optimism

**Problem:** We underestimate risks and costs
**System:**
- Reference class forecasting requirements
- Mandatory pre-mortems
- Adjustment factors for estimates
- Staged commitments with gates

### For Loss Aversion

**Problem:** We overvalue what we have
**System:**
- Fresh-start evaluation ("would we start this today?")
- Ignore sunk costs in future decisions
- External evaluation of continuing investments
- Clean-sheet budgeting

## A Complete Decision System

### For Major Strategic Decisions

**Phase 1: Preparation**
- Define the decision and options
- Identify relevant data
- List biases likely to be in play
- Assign devil's advocate

**Phase 2: Information Gathering**
- Collect data systematically (not just available data)
- Get input from multiple perspectives
- Seek disconfirming evidence
- Document what you don't know

**Phase 3: Evaluation**
- Evaluate options against criteria (not against each other only)
- Devil's advocate presents case against preferred option
- Check for lollapalooza patterns
- Identify what would change your mind

**Phase 4: Decision**
- Document reasoning in writing
- Specify confidence levels
- Set review triggers
- Identify key assumptions to monitor

**Phase 5: Post-Decision**
- Track outcomes vs. expectations
- Review when triggers hit
- Conduct post-mortem if needed
- Learn and update processes

## The Bias Checklist

Before major decisions, review:

### Personal Biases
- [ ] Am I stressed? (Delay if elevated)
- [ ] Do I have incentives that might distort?
- [ ] Am I influenced by liking/disliking people involved?
- [ ] Am I defending a prior commitment?
- [ ] Am I rushing to eliminate uncertainty?

### Information Biases
- [ ] Am I overweighting recent or vivid information?
- [ ] Have I sought base rate data?
- [ ] What's my availability set missing?
- [ ] Who else should weigh in?
- [ ] What would change my mind?

### Social Biases
- [ ] Am I being influenced by what others think?
- [ ] Is authority (mine or others') distorting the discussion?
- [ ] Have I genuinely encouraged pushback?
- [ ] Is there sufficient diversity of perspective?

### Combination Check
- [ ] How many biases are pointing the same direction?
- [ ] Is this starting to feel too certain?
- [ ] What countervailing forces exist?
- [ ] What would a skeptic say?

## CEO System Implementation

### Start Small

Don't overhaul everything at once. Pick one process to redesign:

**Good starting points:**
- Hiring decisions (clear, repeated, measurable)
- Investment approvals (significant impact)
- Strategy reviews (high stakes)
- Performance evaluations (ongoing)

### Build Incrementally

For your chosen process:

**Week 1-2:** Map current process and identify bias points
**Week 3-4:** Design new elements to address key biases
**Month 2:** Pilot with one team or decision type
**Month 3+:** Refine based on experience, then expand

### Model Personally

Systems only work if leaders use them:
- Follow your own checklists
- Submit to the same reviews
- Acknowledge when biases affected you
- Celebrate when systems caught errors

### Create Cultural Reinforcement

Bias-checking should be normal, not exceptional:
- Praise people who raise bias concerns
- Make it safe to challenge decisions
- Share learning from bias failures
- Build bias literacy organization-wide

---

## Common Implementation Failures

### Failure 1: Checkbox Compliance

Going through motions without genuine engagement.
**Prevention:** Make outputs meaningful, not just process completion.

### Failure 2: Authority Override

Leaders bypass systems when inconvenient.
**Prevention:** Leaders must be most visible followers.

### Failure 3: Complexity Paralysis

So many checks that nothing gets done.
**Prevention:** Match system weight to decision importance.

### Failure 4: Missing Enforcement

Systems exist but aren't used.
**Prevention:** Build into workflow, track compliance, create accountability.

## Practical Exercise

### Design Exercise: One Process Redesign

Choose one decision process you're involved in.

**Current State:**
- What decisions does this process govern?
- What biases are most likely to affect these decisions?
- What bias-related failures have occurred?

**Gap Analysis:**
- What protections exist currently?
- What's missing?
- What would the highest-impact addition be?

**Redesign:**
- What specific changes would you make?
- How would you implement them?
- How would you know if they're working?
- What resistance might you face?

## Reflection Questions

1. What structural changes could you make to your decision processes to counteract your most susceptible biases?

2. Where in your organization do biases cause the most damage? What system could address that?

3. What bias-checking systems already exist that aren't being used well?

4. How would you build a culture where bias-checking is normal rather than threatening?

5. What one process change would have the highest impact on decision quality?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Forgetting that humans are nearly incurable on bias, you should recognize that structures and procedures can protect you from bias almost as much as iron."

Don't rely on willpower to overcome bias. Build systems that work even when willpower doesn't.
