# Day 2: Availability-Misweighing Tendency

**Week 6 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger**

> "The brain overweighs what's easily available."

## The Core Insight

Our brains estimate frequency, probability, and importance based on how easily examples come to mind. If something is vivid, recent, or emotionally charged, it's recalled easily—and we overweight it.

**The Availability-Misweighing Tendency** causes us to:
- Give disproportionate weight to recent events
- Overestimate risks that are vivid or emotional
- Underestimate risks that are statistical or abstract
- Base decisions on memorable anecdotes rather than data

This is one of the most pervasive biases in business decision-making.

## How Availability Works

### The Ease-of-Recall Heuristic

When assessing "how common is X?" our brain asks "how easily can I think of examples of X?"

This works when:
- Frequency and recall are correlated
- The sample in our memory is representative
- Recent experience reflects typical experience

This fails when:
- Some things are more memorable than common
- Our personal experience is not representative
- Recent events are unusual

### What Makes Things Available

**Recency:** Recent events are recalled easily
**Vividness:** Dramatic, emotional events stick
**Personal experience:** Things that happened to us
**Narratives:** Stories more than statistics
**Media coverage:** What we've read/heard about

### What Gets Underweighted

**Base rates:** Statistical frequencies
**Gradual trends:** Slow changes
**Abstract data:** Numbers without stories
**The unseen:** What didn't happen, near-misses
**Distant examples:** Things we haven't experienced

## Case Studies

### Case 1: The Recent Disaster

After a competitor's high-profile security breach, a company redirected major resources to security, cutting investment in growth initiatives.

**The analysis:** Security spending became 3x industry norms. The competitor's breach was vivid and available; the gradual cost of underinvesting in growth was not.

**A year later:** Security was excellent, but market position had eroded. The available threat had crowded out the important one.

### Case 2: The Hiring Decision

A manager had a bad experience with a hire from a particular background. For years afterward, she dismissed candidates with similar backgrounds.

**The analysis:** One vivid negative experience overweighted the statistical reality that background was not predictive. Valuable candidates were missed.

**The lesson:** N=1 experiences, especially negative ones, become disproportionately available.

### Case 3: The Missing Risk

A company conducted risk assessments dominated by recent industry events. Risks that hadn't happened recently—but had historical precedent—were underweighted.

**What happened:** An "unlikely" risk materialized. It wasn't unlikely statistically; it just wasn't available in recent memory.

**The lesson:** What's available isn't what's important.

## Availability vs. Reality

### Over-Estimated (High Availability)

- Dramatic, newsworthy events
- Recent occurrences
- Vivid personal experiences
- Things that "feel" common

**Examples:**
- Plane crash risk (vs. actual low frequency)
- Competitor moves that made headlines
- Failures you personally witnessed
- The last thing that went wrong

### Under-Estimated (Low Availability)

- Statistical base rates
- Gradual cumulative effects
- Abstract or distant risks
- Near-misses that didn't materialize

**Examples:**
- Slow market shifts
- Compound effects over time
- Risks without recent incidents
- The things you should have done that you didn't

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: The Base Rate Question

Before making probability judgments, ask:

**"What does the data say?"**
- Not "What do I recall?"
- Not "What feels likely?"
- Not "What happened recently?"

**Practice:**
- Look up actual statistics
- Reference class forecasting (what typically happens?)
- Track your predictions vs. outcomes

### Application 2: Vivid vs. Important

When something vivid demands attention, ask:

**"Is this important, or just available?"**
- A vivid failure gets disproportionate analysis
- A vivid success gets unwarranted confidence
- A vivid risk gets excessive mitigation

**Practice:**
- Consciously adjust for vividness
- Seek data on importance, not just availability
- Allocate resources based on magnitude, not memorability

### Application 3: Deliberate Data Collection

Combat availability bias with systematic information:

**Build dashboards for:**
- Leading indicators (not just lagging crises)
- Base rate information
- Trend data over time
- What's important but not vivid

**Avoid:**
- Decision-making from headlines
- Strategy from anecdotes
- Risk assessment from recent events only

### Application 4: The Missing Information Hunt

Before major decisions, explicitly ask:

**"What am I not thinking about?"**
- What risks haven't happened recently but could?
- What opportunities aren't vivid but are real?
- What data exists that I haven't seen?
- Whose experience differs from mine?

## Availability in Organizations

### The Meeting Bias

Meetings amplify availability bias:
- Recent events dominate discussion
- Whoever has vivid stories has influence
- Abstract data gets little airtime
- The last thing mentioned is most remembered

**Countermeasure:** Structured agendas, pre-read data, written input collection.

### The Reporting Bias

What gets reported shapes what's available:
- Problems get escalated; successes don't
- Dramatic failures get postmortems; near-misses don't
- Whatever was measured last month is most available

**Countermeasure:** Systematic measurement of what matters, not what's dramatic.

### The Memory Bias

Organizational memory is patchy:
- Crises are remembered; steady-state isn't
- Departures take knowledge with them
- Institutional lessons fade

**Countermeasure:** Documentation, knowledge management, deliberate history.

## Interacting with Other Biases

### Availability + Social Proof

What others are talking about becomes available to you. If everyone's worried about X, X feels important—even if it's not.

### Availability + Stress

Under stress, only highly available information is processed. Nuance disappears; vivid threats dominate.

### Availability + Denial

Painful information may be suppressed from memory, making it less available even when relevant.

## Practical Techniques

### Technique 1: The Objective Starting Point

Before deliberation, establish objective data:
- What are the base rates?
- What does statistical analysis show?
- What's the historical pattern?

Start here, then adjust for specifics—not the other way around.

### Technique 2: The Experience Diversification

Your availability set is limited to your experience. Expand it:
- Seek perspectives from people with different experiences
- Study historical cases outside your domain
- Read widely to fill memory with diverse examples

### Technique 3: The Deliberate Contrast

When something vivid commands attention, deliberately contrast:
- How does this compare to base rates?
- What other things should I be thinking about?
- Is this receiving attention proportional to importance?

### Technique 4: The Slow Decision

Availability effects are strongest in quick judgments. Slow down:
- Require data collection before deciding
- Sleep on it (first impressions fade)
- Get input from others with different availability sets

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Availability Audit

For a current major concern:

1. How did this become a concern? (Recent event? Vivid story? Personal experience?)
2. What does objective data say about its importance?
3. What's the gap between felt importance and statistical importance?
4. What should you be concerned about that you're not?

### Exercise 2: The Memory Sample

List five risks you're currently worried about.
List five things you're confident about.

For each:
1. What made it available? (Why is it in your list?)
2. Is availability correlated with actual importance/truth?
3. What's missing from these lists that data would suggest?

### Exercise 3: The News Diet

Track what business news you consume this week.

- How much is vivid/dramatic vs. statistical/analytical?
- How might your availability set be shaped by this diet?
- What would a different information diet do to your judgment?

## Reflection Questions

1. What recent event might be distorting your current judgment?

2. Are you overweighting vivid anecdotes over base rate data anywhere?

3. What information should be more available to you but isn't?

4. How has personal experience created availability biases in your thinking?

5. What systematic processes could you create to counteract availability effects?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that prior conclusions remain intact." — Warren Buffett

Availability shapes what we consider, which shapes what we conclude. Control your availability set, and you improve your conclusions.
