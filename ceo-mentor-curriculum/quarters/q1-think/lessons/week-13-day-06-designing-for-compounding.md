**Week 13 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

## The Core Insight

Some businesses and activities are designed to compound naturally—they get better with time, scale, and experience. Others fight against time—they require constant reinvention, face decay, or don't accumulate advantage.

The CEO's job is to design for compounding: build businesses, organizations, and personal habits where time works for you, not against you.

## What Makes Something Compound

### The Compounding Business

**Characteristics:**
- Network effects that strengthen with scale
- Learning that improves with experience
- Switching costs that deepen over time
- Brand that builds with consistency
- Data that accumulates value

**Examples:** Amazon, Coca-Cola, Microsoft

### The Non-Compounding Business

**Characteristics:**
- No network effects
- Constant reinvention required
- Customers easily switch
- Brand doesn't accumulate
- Each transaction stands alone

**Examples:** Many service businesses, commodity products, trend-dependent industries

### The Compounding Test

**Ask:**
- Does time make this stronger?
- Does scale improve the economics?
- Does experience create advantage?
- Would I be in a better position in 10 years from accumulated effort?

## Designing Compounding Businesses

### Build Network Effects

**How to design for them:**
- Create value that increases with users
- Make connections the product
- Build ecosystems, not products
- Design for user-to-user value creation

**Examples:**
- Marketplace: More sellers → more buyers → more sellers
- Platform: More developers → more apps → more users → more developers
- Community: More members → more content → more members

### Build Switching Costs

**How to design for them:**
- Embed in customer operations
- Accumulate customer-specific data
- Create ecosystems around your product
- Build habits and workflows

**Over time:** Each year of use makes switching more painful.

### Build Learning Advantages

**How to design for them:**
- Capture operational learnings
- Improve processes continuously
- Accumulate institutional knowledge
- Get better at your core competency

**Over time:** Experience creates advantage competitors can't buy.

### Build Brand Equity

**How to design for it:**
- Consistent quality over years
- Accumulated customer trust
- Emotional associations deepened
- Heritage and legacy created

**Over time:** Brand becomes an asset competitors can't replicate.

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Amazon's Flywheel

Amazon designed for compounding:

**The flywheel:**
- Lower prices → more customers

**The design:**
- Each element strengthens others
- Success feeds more success

### Case 2: Warren Buffett's Personal Design

Buffett designed his life for compounding:

**The design:**

### Case 3: The Non-Compounding Business

A trend-dependent business:

**The problem:**
- Each product starts over

1. How could it be redesigned to compound?
2. What would that require?
3. Is it worth it?
