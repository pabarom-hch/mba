# Day 5: Inverting Goals

**Week 2 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger**

> "All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there."

## The Core Insight

We set goals. We plan to achieve them. We think about what we should do.

Inversion asks different questions:
- What would **guarantee** I never achieve this goal?
- What should I **stop** doing?
- What behaviors am I engaging in that work **against** my stated objectives?

Often the path to achievement isn't adding more effort—it's removing the obstacles you're creating for yourself.

---

## Why Goal Inversion Works

### 1. Blind Spots About Self-Sabotage

We're often blind to how we undermine ourselves:
- The leader who says they want candor but punishes honest feedback
- The entrepreneur who claims to value learning but avoids experiments that might fail
- The executive who prioritizes health but schedules no time for exercise

**We see what we intend. Inversion reveals what we do.**

### 2. The Subtraction Advantage

Most goal-setting is additive: "I should do more of X."

Inversion is subtractive: "I should do less of Y."

Subtraction is often easier and more impactful:
- Easier: Stop one bad habit vs. build one new habit
- More impactful: Removing toxicity vs. adding more nutrition

### 3. Reveals True Priorities

When you identify what guarantees failure, you discover what you're actually prioritizing:

**Example:**
- Goal: Build a great team
- Inversion: Guarantee a bad team by hiring for skills alone, ignoring culture fit
- Reality check: Am I hiring for skills alone? Then my true priority isn't a great team—it's expedience

## The Goal Inversion Method

### Step 1: State the Goal

Write your most important goal clearly:

"I want to _______________"

Be specific. "Succeed as CEO" is too vague. "Build a $100M revenue company with engaged employees and satisfied customers" is better.

### Step 2: Invert It

Ask: "If I wanted to guarantee I never achieve this, what would I do?"

List at least 10 items. Push past the obvious.

**Example goal:** Build a world-class engineering team

**Inversion (guarantees failure):**
1. Hire quickly to fill seats
2. Tolerate poor performers
3. Ignore culture fit
4. Micromanage every decision
5. Take credit for team wins
6. Blame team for losses
7. Skip 1:1s and career conversations
8. Pay below market
9. Break commitments routinely
10. Avoid giving feedback

### Step 3: Reality Check

For each item on your inverted list, honestly assess:

| Failure Behavior | Am I Doing This? (1-10) | Evidence |
|------------------|------------------------|----------|
| | | |
| | | |

Where you score high, you've found where you're working against your own goal.

### Step 4: Create the Anti-List

Your goal might have a to-do list. Create a **not-to-do list**:

"To achieve [goal], I will NOT:"
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________

This is often more actionable than positive planning.

### Step 5: Build Systems

For each failure behavior you're engaging in:
- What triggers it?
- What system would prevent it?
- Who will hold you accountable?

## The Three Layers of Goal Inversion

### Layer 1: Behavior Inversion

What daily behaviors would prevent this goal?

**Example (goal: healthy lifestyle):**
- Skip workouts
- Eat processed food
- Sleep less than 6 hours
- Skip breakfast
- Work through lunch
- Drink excessively

### Layer 2: Decision Inversion

What decisions would prevent this goal?

**Example (goal: healthy lifestyle):**
- Accept jobs that require 80-hour weeks
- Live far from work (long commute)
- Not invest in home exercise equipment
- Choose convenience over health in food

### Layer 3: Identity Inversion

What identity/mindset would prevent this goal?

**Example (goal: healthy lifestyle):**
- "I'm just not a fitness person"
- "I don't have time for myself"
- "Work comes first always"
- "Sleep is for the weak"

Identity-level inversions reveal the deepest obstacles.

## The Not-To-Do List

### Why It Matters

Your to-do list tells you what to add. Your not-to-do list tells you what to subtract.

**Research shows:** People who focus on stopping bad behaviors are more successful than those who focus only on adding good ones.

### Creating Your Not-To-Do List

**Format:**
"I do not _______________"
"I will not _______________"
"I refuse to _______________"

**CEO Not-To-Do List Example:**

1. I do not check email before 9 AM
2. I will not hire for urgency over quality
3. I refuse to tolerate values violations, regardless of performance
4. I do not schedule back-to-back meetings all day
5. I will not skip my 1:1s with direct reports
6. I refuse to make major decisions when tired or emotional
7. I do not accept every meeting invitation
8. I will not avoid difficult conversations
9. I refuse to take credit that belongs to others
10. I do not skip exercise more than two days in a row

### Making It Stick

**Post it visibly:** Where you'll see it daily
**Share it:** Accountability improves compliance
**Review weekly:** Are you sticking to it?
**Update it:** As you learn what matters, refine the list

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Warren Buffett's "Avoid at All Costs" List

Buffett created a "20-slot" rule: Imagine you can only make 20 investments in your lifetime. This inverts the goal of wealth building by constraining action rather than encouraging it.

**The inversion:** Guaranteed wealth destruction would come from:
- Frequent trading
- Following hot tips
- Leveraging heavily
- Investing outside competence
- Acting on emotion

Buffett's success comes as much from what he avoids as what he does.

### Case 2: Jim Collins' "Stop Doing" List

In *Good to Great*, Collins emphasizes the "stop doing" list alongside the "to-do" list.

His insight: Great companies achieve focus not by adding initiatives but by ruthlessly stopping things that don't contribute to the core mission.

**Application:** Your strategic plan should include what you will stop, not just what you will start.

### Case 3: Steve Jobs' Focus Through Elimination

When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he didn't just add new products—he killed 70% of the product line.

**The inversion:** What would guarantee Apple's failure?
- Too many products
- Diluted focus
- Mediocre everything
- No clear identity

Jobs' success came from what he eliminated.

## The Weekly Goal Inversion Practice

### Every Monday (10 minutes):

1. **Review your top 3 goals** for the week
2. **For each goal, identify one behavior** that would prevent it
3. **Commit** to not engaging in that behavior
4. **Note** at week's end: Did you succeed?

### Every Quarter (30 minutes):

1. **Review your major goals** for the quarter
2. **Run full inversion** on each
3. **Create/update your not-to-do list**
4. **Identify one systemic change** to prevent your most common failure behavior

### Exercise 2: The Anti-Résumé

Write your "anti-résumé"—the résumé of someone who would definitely fail at your role:

**Anti-Résumé for CEO of [Your Company]:**

**Guaranteed to fail because they:**
-
-
-
-
-

**Now ask:** Which of these describe me, even occasionally?

### Exercise 3: Advice to a Friend

Imagine a friend has your exact goals and asks your advice.

**What would you tell them NOT to do?**

**Now ask:** Am I following my own advice?

## The Inversion Mindset Shift

### From "What should I do?" to "What should I stop doing?"

Most advice is additive:
- Read more books
- Have more meetings
- Build more relationships
- Work on more skills

Inversion is subtractive:
- Stop reading low-quality content
- Stop attending unnecessary meetings
- Stop maintaining energy-draining relationships
- Stop developing skills you won't use

### From "How do I succeed?" to "How do I avoid failing?"

Success requires many things to go right.
Failure often requires just one thing to go wrong.

Preventing the one thing may be easier than achieving the many things.

## Reflection Questions

1. What is your most important goal? What would guarantee you never achieve it?

2. Of those failure behaviors, which are you currently doing? Be honest.

3. What's on your not-to-do list? If you don't have one, what should be?

4. What activity should you stop that you've been unwilling to stop?

5. What would past-you say about how current-you is pursuing your goals?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken." — Warren Buffett

The behaviors that prevent goal achievement are often habits—invisible until you use inversion to surface them.
