## The Integrity Toolkit

### Tool 2: The Long-Term Calculation

For integrity decisions:
- What's the short-term cost?
- What's the 20-year reputation value?
- What's the right choice?

### Tool 3: The Leverage Check

When you have power:
- What could you extract?
- What's fair treatment?
- Which are you choosing?

### Tool 4: The Organizational Walk-Through

Regularly assess:

## Week 11 Summary

Integrity is strategy, not just ethics:

**The core insight:** Reputation compounds like money. Trust enables efficiency. Costly integrity builds lasting advantage. Integrity isn't a constraint on business—it's a competitive weapon.

**The practical application:**
- Apply the newspaper test to every significant decision
- Build integrity into hiring, systems, and culture
- Invest in trust-building with all stakeholders
- Accept short-term costs for long-term reputation
- Choose integrity especially when it's expensive

**The transformation:** Once you see integrity as strategic asset rather than constraint, decisions become clearer. The question shifts from "Can we get away with this?" to "What would build the most valuable long-term reputation?"
