**Week 11 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

> "Honesty is a very expensive gift. Don't expect it from cheap people."

## The Core Insight

Trust isn't just morally good—it's operationally efficient. High-trust relationships require less verification, less protection, less negotiation, and less friction. Low-trust relationships consume enormous resources in contracts, lawyers, oversight, and second-guessing.

The CEO who builds a high-trust organization and high-trust relationships saves time, reduces costs, and moves faster than competitors mired in defensive complexity.

## The Economics of Trust

### The Trust Dividend

**In high-trust environments:**
- Deals close faster
- Contracts are simpler
- Verification is minimal
- Communication flows
- People give benefit of doubt
- Problems get solved, not escalated

**In low-trust environments:**
- Deals drag on
- Contracts are complex
- Verification is constant
- Communication is guarded
- People assume the worst
- Problems become battles

### The Hidden Costs of Low Trust

**Direct costs:**
- Legal fees
- Contract negotiation time
- Verification systems
- Oversight mechanisms
- Insurance premiums

**Indirect costs:**
- Opportunity cost of slow decisions
- Lost deals from extended negotiations
- Talent avoiding low-trust cultures
- Innovation suppressed by protection behaviors

**Cultural costs:**
- Internal politics consuming energy
- Information hoarding
- Defensive behavior
- Reduced collaboration

## Trust as Speed

### Decision Speed

**High trust:**
- Agreement reached quickly
- Handshake deals honored
- Execution begins immediately
- Adjustments made collaboratively

**Low trust:**
- Every term negotiated
- Everything documented
- Contingencies for every scenario
- Changes require renegotiation

**The speed difference:** High-trust decisions happen 2-10x faster.

### Execution Speed

**High trust:**
- Delegation works
- Autonomy is granted
- Mistakes are tolerated
- Focus on outcomes

**Low trust:**
- Micromanagement required
- Permission for everything
- Blame-avoidance behavior
- Focus on CYA

**The speed difference:** High-trust execution is dramatically faster.

### Problem-Solving Speed

**High trust:**
- Problems surfaced early
- Root causes discussed honestly
- Solutions found collaboratively
- Learning happens

**Low trust:**
- Problems hidden until they explode
- Blame assignment first
- Defensive solutions
- Learning blocked by protection

**The speed difference:** High-trust organizations solve problems before they're crises.

## Building High-Trust Relationships

### The Trust Equation

**Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Interest**

**Credibility:** Do you know what you're talking about?
**Reliability:** Do you do what you say?
**Intimacy:** Can I share concerns with you?
**Self-Interest:** Are you focused on yourself or on our shared interests?

### Building Each Component

**Credibility:**
- Demonstrate competence
- Admit what you don't know
- Provide accurate information
- Be right about things you claim expertise in

**Reliability:**
- Keep commitments
- Do what you say you'll do
- Be consistent over time
- Communicate when you can't deliver

**Intimacy:**
- Create safety for honest conversation
- Listen genuinely
- Respect confidentiality
- Be vulnerable appropriately

**Low Self-Interest:**
- Focus on shared outcomes
- Consider their interests genuinely
- Make fair deals even when you have power
- Don't exploit information advantages
