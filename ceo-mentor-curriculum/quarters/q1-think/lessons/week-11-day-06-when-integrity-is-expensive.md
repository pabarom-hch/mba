**Week 11 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

## The Core Insight

Integrity is easiest when it's free—when the right thing and the profitable thing align. The true test of integrity comes when it's expensive: when doing right costs money, opportunity, or advantage.

These moments—when you have leverage you could exploit, when no one would know, when competitors are cheating, when short-term pressure is intense—are when integrity is most tested and when it matters most.

## When Integrity Costs Most

### When You Have Leverage

**The situation:**
- You have power over someone
- You could extract more than is fair
- They have no recourse
- No one would blame you

**The test:**
- Do you take what you could?
- Or do you deal fairly despite power?

**The principle:** Integrity with leverage is rare and valuable. It builds lasting relationships and reputation.

### When No One Is Watching

**The situation:**
- No oversight exists
- Discovery is unlikely
- The gain is real
- The cost of ethics is high

**The test:**
- Does your behavior change when unobserved?
- Is your public and private self consistent?

**The principle:** Integrity without audience is integrity that counts.

### When Competitors Are Cheating

**The situation:**
- Competitors are cutting corners
- They're winning because of it
- Ethical behavior seems naive
- Pressure to match is intense

**The test:**
- Do you match their behavior?
- Or compete on your terms?

**The principle:** "Everyone does it" is not a defense. It's a choice.

### When Short-Term Pressure Is Intense

**The situation:**
- Quarter is ending
- Targets are at risk
- Shortcuts would help
- Long-term consequences seem distant

**The test:**
- Do you cut corners?
- Or accept short-term pain?

**The principle:** Integrity under pressure is integrity that matters.

### When Mistakes Are Hideable

**The situation:**
- You made an error
- You could cover it up
- No one else knows yet
- Consequences of disclosure are painful

**The test:**
- Do you hide or disclose?
- Do you take responsibility?

**The principle:** Integrity includes honesty about failure.

## The Higher Cost, The Higher Value

### Why Expensive Integrity Is Worth More

**Reputation building:**
- Anyone can be ethical when it's free
- Costly integrity is rare
- Rare behavior is noticed
- Reputation is built on notable acts

**Relationship building:**
- Partners remember when you didn't exploit them
- Employees remember when you kept costly commitments
- Customers remember when you took the hit

**Character building:**
- Each costly integrity choice strengthens resolve
- Each compromise weakens it
- Character compounds like reputation

### The Long-Term Math

**Short-term:**
- Integrity cost: $X
- Immediate return: $0

**Long-term:**
- Reputation value: Multiple of $X
- Relationship value: Multiple of $X
- Character value: Incalculable

**The math:** The short-term cost is investment in long-term returns.

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Buffett and the Struggling Company

When a Berkshire company struggles:

**The leverage opportunity:**
- He could squeeze management
- He could threaten replacement
- He has all the power

**What he does:**
- Supports management through difficulty
- Maintains patience and partnership
- Helps solve problems, not exploits them

**The result:**
- Companies want to sell to Berkshire
- Management stays loyal
- Reputation attracts deals

### Case 2: The Vendor in Distress

A CEO faced a situation where a key vendor was in financial trouble:

**The leverage opportunity:**
- Renegotiate contracts favorably
- Extract better terms while they're desperate
- They had no choice

**The integrity choice:**
- Maintained fair terms
- Even provided early payment to help cash flow
- Treated them as partner, not victim

**The result:**
- Vendor survived and remains loyal
- Became preferential customer for best products
- Story spread in industry about fair dealing

### Case 3: The Quarterly Shortfall

A company faced a quarterly miss:

**The shortcut options:**
- Push revenue forward (questionable accounting)
- Pull expenses back (delay necessary spending)
- Pressure customers to buy early

**The integrity choice:**
- Report honestly
- Take the short-term pain
- Explain what happened and why

**The result:**
- Credibility preserved
- Trust with investors maintained
- Foundation for future success intact

## Making Costly Integrity Easier

### Pre-Commitment

**Commit before the moment:**
- Establish policies in advance
- Decide values before pressure
- Prepare for ethical dilemmas
- Make the commitment public

**Why it helps:** Decisions made under pressure are harder. Pre-commitment removes the decision.

### Support Structures

**Build support:**
- Advisors who reinforce integrity
- Peers who share values
- Board that supports ethical choices
- Culture that expects integrity

**Why it helps:** Costly integrity is easier with support than alone.

### Perspective Taking

**Remember the long game:**
- This moment is temporary
- Reputation is permanent
- Short-term pain enables long-term gain
- Future self will judge this choice

**Why it helps:** Long-term perspective reframes the cost.

### Story Telling

**Remember the stories:**
- Those who maintained integrity under pressure
- The long-term outcomes of their choices
- What kind of story you want to be

**Why it helps:** Stories inspire and guide behavior.

Why? Because that's when you see what they're really made of. Integrity in good times is easy. Integrity in trouble is revealing. Be the kind of organization that Buffett would want to partner with in your darkest hour.
