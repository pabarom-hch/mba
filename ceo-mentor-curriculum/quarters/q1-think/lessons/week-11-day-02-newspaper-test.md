# Day 2: The Newspaper Test

**Week 11 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

> "I want employees to ask themselves whether they are willing to have any contemplated act appear the next day on the front page of their local paper."

## The Core Insight

The newspaper test is Buffett's simple filter for ethical decision-making: Would you be comfortable if your action appeared on the front page of the newspaper, written by a reporter who is reasonably intelligent but skeptical and has all the facts?

This test cuts through rationalization, peer pressure, and incremental boundary-creeping. It forces you to imagine how your action looks to an outsider—because eventually, many actions do become visible to outsiders.

## How the Test Works

### The Setup

Before any significant decision or action, ask:
- Would I be comfortable if this appeared on the front page tomorrow?
- Written by a skeptical reporter with all the facts?
- With my name attached?
- Read by my family, colleagues, and community?

### Why It Works

**It breaks through rationalization:**
- We're good at convincing ourselves
- We construct narratives that justify
- The newspaper test requires external perspective

**It imagines eventual exposure:**
- Most secrets eventually surface
- Digital trails persist
- Whistleblowers exist
- Assume everything becomes known

**It activates shame:**
- Not embarrassment (caring what others think)
- But shame (caring whether you're acting rightly)
- The healthy kind that keeps behavior in bounds

## Applying the Test

### What to Include

**The full context:**
- Not the sanitized version
- Not the carefully framed narrative
- The actual facts as they are
- Including the parts you'd rather not mention

**Your role:**
- Your specific decisions
- Your specific instructions
- Your awareness of what was happening
- Your response when problems arose

**The consequences:**
- Who was affected
- How they were affected
- What the outcomes were
- Both intended and unintended

### The Questions to Ask

1. **If this were reported, would I be comfortable?**
   - With my family reading it?
   - With my employees reading it?
   - With my customers reading it?
   - With regulators reading it?

2. **Is there a version of this I'm hoping won't be discovered?**
   - Hidden aspects I'm avoiding?
   - Details I'd rather not explain?
   - Context I hope stays hidden?

3. **Am I relying on secrecy for comfort?**
   - Would I only do this if no one found out?
   - Does it only work if it stays hidden?
   - Is secrecy essential to the plan?

## Common Failures of the Test

### Failure 1: The Incomplete Application

**The mistake:** Applying the test to the sanitized version

**Example:**
- "We're restructuring for efficiency" (sounds fine)
- "We're laying off 200 people two weeks before Christmas after promising no layoffs" (newspaper version)

**The fix:** Apply the test to the full story, including uncomfortable details

### Failure 2: The Selective Reporter

**The mistake:** Imagining a friendly reporter

**Example:**
- "A reporter would understand our business reasons"
- Reality: Reporters often focus on impact, not intent

**The fix:** Imagine a skeptical but fair reporter who will tell both sides

### Failure 3: The Delayed Application

**The mistake:** Applying the test after the fact

**Example:**
- Decision made, rationalization constructed later
- "How do we explain this?" instead of "Should we do this?"

**The fix:** Apply the test before decisions, not as post-hoc rationalization

### Failure 4: The Industry Norm Excuse

**The mistake:** "Everyone does this"

**Example:**
- "Industry standard practice"
- Newspaper: "Company follows industry-wide pattern of [questionable practice]"

**The fix:** "Everyone does it" won't help on the front page

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Wells Fargo Account Scandal

Wells Fargo employees created millions of fake accounts.

**The newspaper test failure:**
- Would executives want "Wells Fargo employees opened fake accounts to meet sales targets; management knew and continued pressure" on the front page?
- Obviously not.
- The test should have stopped this long before it became public.

**The lesson:** If you can't imagine it on the front page, don't do it.

### Case 2: The Salomon Brothers Scandal

When Buffett took over Salomon after its Treasury bond scandal:

**His guidance to employees:**
- "Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless."
- He made the newspaper test explicit: Don't do anything you wouldn't want reported.

**The lesson:** Make the test explicit and enforced.

### Case 3: Boeing 737 MAX

Internal communications revealed engineers knew about problems.

**The newspaper reality:**
- "Boeing knew about safety issues, prioritized schedule over fixes"
- Engineers' own messages became damning evidence
- The internal rationalization didn't survive public exposure

**The lesson:** Internal communications are often eventual newspaper stories.

## CEO Applications

### Application 1: Current Decision Audit

**Apply the test to your three most sensitive current decisions:**

| Decision | Newspaper Headline | Comfortable? | If No, Why Proceeding? |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| | | Y/N | |
| | | Y/N | |
| | | Y/N | |

### Application 2: Practice Audit

**Apply the test to ongoing practices:**

| Practice | How Would It Be Reported? | Comfortable? | If No, What Changes? |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| | | Y/N | |
| | | Y/N | |
| | | Y/N | |

### Application 3: Organization-Wide Application

**Make the test explicit:**
- Include in ethics training
- Reference in decision meetings
- Ask it publicly and regularly
- Create culture of applying it

### Application 4: The Email Test

**Special case for written communication:**
- Would you send this email if you knew it would be public?
- Would you send this message if it would be read in court?
- If not, reconsider sending it at all

## Building the Newspaper Test into Culture

### Make It Explicit

**State it clearly:**
- "Before any decision, ask if you'd be comfortable with it on the front page"
- Include in training
- Reference in meetings
- Model it yourself

### Make It Expected

**Create the expectation:**
- Ask the question in decision meetings
- Expect people to apply it
- Follow up when they don't
- Reward those who surface concerns

### Make It Safe

**Enable honesty:**
- Protect people who raise newspaper test concerns
- Don't punish the messenger
- Take concerns seriously
- Demonstrate that the test matters

### Make It Actionable

**Follow through:**
- When something fails the test, stop
- When past decisions fail retrospective test, address them
- Don't ignore test failures
- Build trust that the test has teeth

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Historical Test

Look back at past decisions:
1. Which would have been uncomfortable on the front page?
2. Did they ever become public?
3. What happened?
4. What would you do differently?

### Exercise 2: The Current Test

Apply to your current portfolio:
1. List major current decisions and practices
2. Apply the newspaper test to each
3. Which fail?
4. What will you do about it?

### Exercise 3: The Culture Test

Assess your organization's relationship with the test:
1. Do people apply it naturally?
2. Is it explicit in your culture?
3. Are there areas where it's not applied?
4. What would make it more embedded?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. What current practices would be uncomfortable if reported on the front page? Why are you doing them?

2. When have you relied on secrecy for comfort with a decision?

3. Is the newspaper test explicit in your organization's culture?

4. What would change if you consistently applied this test?

5. Are you modeling the test in your own decisions?

## Key Quote for the Day

> "I want employees to ask themselves whether they are willing to have any contemplated act appear the next day on the front page of their local paper."

This simple test, applied consistently, prevents most ethical failures. The failures occur when we don't apply it, apply it incompletely, or apply it too late.
