# Day 4: What Would a Smart Enemy Do?

**Week 2 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Charlie Munger**

> "Always ask: What could go wrong? How could this fail?"

---

## The Core Insight

The pre-mortem asks how things could fail. This takes it further: **if a brilliant adversary wanted to destroy your business, how would they do it?**

This isn't paranoia—it's red team thinking. By putting yourself in an attacker's shoes, you see vulnerabilities that friendly analysis misses. You discover what you've been too comfortable to see.

Militaries, governments, and sophisticated companies use red teams. As CEO, you should too.

---

## Why Red Team Thinking Works

### 1. Adversarial Perspective Reveals More

Friendly analysis asks: "What might go wrong?"
Adversarial analysis asks: "How would I make it go wrong?"

The adversarial frame:
- Forces specificity (you need a plan of attack)
- Removes wishful thinking (enemies don't assume the best)
- Surfaces non-obvious vulnerabilities
- Connects individual weaknesses into attack chains

### 2. Smart Enemies Are More Dangerous Than Random Failure

Random failure is diffuse. A smart enemy is concentrated.

**Random failure:** Something might go wrong with any component.
**Smart enemy:** Identifies the weakest component and exploits it precisely.

Your defense should protect against the smart attack, not just random misfortune.

### 3. Enemies See What You Can't

You have blind spots about your own operation:
- Assumptions you've stopped questioning
- Weaknesses you've normalized
- Strengths that might be exploited

An enemy has fresh eyes and no attachment to your narrative.

## The Smart Enemy Exercise

### Step 1: Define the Enemy

Create a profile of your adversary. The more specific, the more useful:

**Option A: A well-funded competitor**
- Unlimited resources
- Your industry knowledge
- Strong execution capability
- No ethical constraints (or standard business ethics)

**Option B: A startup disruptor**
- No legacy constraints
- Modern technology advantage
- Different cost structure
- Willing to break industry rules

**Option C: A tech giant entering your space**
- Massive resources and talent
- Platform advantages
- Existing customer relationships
- Patience to win long-term

Choose the enemy most likely to threaten you.

### Step 2: Give Them Your Information

Assume the smart enemy has complete information about:
- Your strategy and roadmap
- Your financials and cost structure
- Your customer base and relationships
- Your technology and capabilities
- Your team and organizational dynamics
- Your known weaknesses

They've read every press release, SEC filing, and Glassdoor review. They've talked to your ex-employees and unhappy customers.

### Step 3: Develop Their Attack Plan

You are now the enemy. Spend 30 minutes developing a detailed attack plan.

**Their goal:** Destroy your business, steal your market, or neutralize your advantage.

**Questions to answer:**
1. What is our target's greatest vulnerability?
2. How would we exploit it?
3. What would they struggle to respond to?
4. What attack would cause maximum damage with minimum cost?
5. What sequence of moves would be hardest to counter?

### Step 4: Return to Defense

Switch back to your perspective. Now:
- Rate each attack by likelihood and impact
- Identify which attacks you're most vulnerable to
- Develop specific defenses and contingencies

## Common Attack Vectors

### 1. Customer Attacks

**How they attack:**
- Undercut your pricing to your best customers
- Solve the problem your customers have with you
- Create switching incentives (migration support, discounts)
- Build superior product for your most profitable segment

**Questions to ask:**
- Which customers are most vulnerable to poaching?
- What would make our customers switch?
- Where are we taking customer loyalty for granted?

### 2. Talent Attacks

**How they attack:**
- Recruit your key people with better offers
- Create better culture/opportunity narrative
- Poach entire teams, not just individuals
- Use your talent to understand your playbook

**Questions to ask:**
- Who are the 10 people who would hurt most to lose?
- What would make them leave?
- How easily could competitors replicate our team's knowledge?

### 3. Technology Attacks

**How they attack:**
- Leapfrog your technology with next-generation approach
- Make your technology obsolete with new paradigm
- Commoditize your differentiator
- Build on open source while you maintain proprietary

**Questions to ask:**
- What technology shift would make our approach obsolete?
- Where are we over-invested in legacy technology?
- What would a "start from scratch" competitor build differently?

### 4. Business Model Attacks

**How they attack:**
- Give away what you charge for (supported by other revenue)
- Vertical integration to remove you from value chain
- Platform strategy that makes you dependent
- Regulatory arbitrage that creates cost advantage

**Questions to ask:**
- Could someone profitably give away our core product?
- How could we be disintermediated?
- What business model changes would we struggle to match?

### 5. Ecosystem Attacks

**How they attack:**
- Win over your key partners
- Create switching costs in the platform layer
- Build an ecosystem that excludes you
- Control standards and interfaces

**Questions to ask:**
- Which partnerships are we most dependent on?
- How could we be locked out of critical ecosystems?
- Where do we depend on others' goodwill?

### 6. Speed Attacks

**How they attack:**
- Move faster to capture opportunity
- Iterate faster to find product-market fit
- Scale faster to achieve critical mass first
- Decide faster to outmaneuver

**Questions to ask:**
- Where are we slower than we should be?
- What decision-making bottlenecks could be exploited?
- How would a faster competitor beat us?

## Red Teaming Your Strategy

### Your Strategic Plan

Take your current strategic plan. Now attack it:

| Strategic Bet | How Enemy Would Counter | Our Vulnerability |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Your Competitive Moat

List your sources of competitive advantage. Now attack each:

| Advantage We Claim | How Enemy Would Overcome | How Strong Is This Really? |
|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Your Key Assumptions

List the assumptions underlying your strategy. Now attack each:

| Assumption | How Enemy Would Invalidate | What If They're Right? |
|------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Netflix Attacks Blockbuster

**Blockbuster's perspective (2000):**
- 9,000 stores, dominant brand
- Late fees = major profit center
- Customer convenience through locations
- Scale advantages

**Netflix's smart enemy attack:**
- No late fees (eliminates Blockbuster's profit center)
- Subscription model (predictable revenue)
- Home delivery (better convenience than stores)
- No stores (lower cost structure)
- Later: streaming (changes the game entirely)

**What Blockbuster missed:** They saw Netflix as a small mail-order operation, not a smart enemy attacking their entire model.

### Case 2: Apple Attacks Nokia/Blackberry

**Nokia/Blackberry's perspective (2006):**
- Dominant smartphone market share
- Carrier relationships
- Hardware expertise
- Business market lock-in (Blackberry)

**Apple's smart enemy attack:**
- Consumer-first design (not carrier-first)
- App ecosystem (not just device)
- Touch interface (not keyboard)
- Premium pricing (not volume)
- Carrier desperation for iPhone (power shift)

**What Nokia/Blackberry missed:** They saw Apple as a computer company entering their space, not understanding Apple would redefine what a phone was.

### Case 3: Amazon Attacks Retail

**Traditional retail's perspective (1995):**
- Real estate lock-in with customers
- Immediate gratification (walk out with product)
- Touch-and-feel advantage
- Brand and trust

**Amazon's smart enemy attack:**
- Unlimited selection (no physical constraints)
- Lower costs (no stores)
- Reviews and recommendations
- Relentless efficiency improvement
- Prime membership (switching cost)
- Eventually: same-day delivery (neutralizing "immediate")

**What retail missed:** They saw Amazon as an online bookstore, not a smart enemy that would systematically attack every retail advantage.

## Turning Defense Into Offense

### The Best Defense

Once you identify attack vectors, you have choices:

**Option 1: Fortify**
- Strengthen weak points
- Build barriers to attack
- Create costs for attacking

**Option 2: Preempt**
- Attack yourself before enemy does
- Cannibalize your own business strategically
- Eliminate the vulnerability by changing

**Option 3: Neutralize**
- Acquire potential attackers
- Partner with potential enemies
- Create mutual dependence

### Attacking Yourself

The most aggressive defense is to attack yourself before others do:

**Questions:**
- If we were going to disrupt ourselves, how would we do it?
- What business should we build that would compete with our current business?
- Where should we cannibalize our own revenue?

Companies that attack themselves:
- Netflix: DVD to streaming
- Amazon: Retail to AWS
- Apple: iPod to iPhone
- Microsoft: Windows/Office to Cloud

Companies that didn't attack themselves (and someone else did):
- Kodak, Blockbuster, Nokia, Encyclopedia Britannica

## The CEO's Enemy List

### Internal Enemies

Sometimes the smart enemy is inside:

**Complacency:** "We're successful; why change?"
**Politics:** "Let's not challenge that person's territory"
**Short-termism:** "This quarter matters more than the future"
**Ego:** "I can't be wrong about this"
**Fear:** "Better to do nothing than risk failure"

**The question:** If these internal enemies wanted to destroy your company, would you be helping them?

### External Enemies You're Ignoring

Who might attack you that you're not watching?

- Startups in adjacent spaces
- Large companies for whom your market is a rounding error
- International competitors
- Companies with different business models
- Non-traditional competitors (tech giants, platforms)

### Your Own Past Self

Your current strategy was designed for past conditions. Would past-you attack current-you?

**Questions:**
- What would the founding team think of how we operate now?
- What constraints have we accepted that a startup wouldn't?
- Where are we defending the past instead of building the future?

**Now return to defense:**

**Most dangerous element of attack:**

**Our current defense strength (1-10):**

**What we need to do:**

### Exercise 2: Hire the Enemy

Imagine you've hired your smartest competitor's CEO as a consultant. They have full access to your company.

**What would they say is your biggest vulnerability?**

**What would they say you should do about it?**

**What would they say you're too afraid to do?**

### Exercise 3: The 10x Smarter Enemy

Your enemy is 10x smarter than you assumed. What attack are you now vulnerable to that you thought was impossible?

---

## Reflection Questions

1. If a brilliant enemy studied your business for a year and then attacked, where would they strike?

2. What attack would you struggle most to respond to? Why?

3. Where are you ignoring a potential threat because it's uncomfortable to consider?

4. Should you attack yourself before someone else does? In what area?

5. What would it take to make your business truly unattackable?
