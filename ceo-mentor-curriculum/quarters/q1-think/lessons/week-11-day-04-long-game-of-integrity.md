**Week 11 | Q1 — THINK | Mentor: Warren Buffett**

## The Core Insight

Integrity is a long game. The costs are paid now; the returns come later. Short-term thinking and integrity are often in tension—cutting corners, hiding problems, or shading the truth can boost today's results at the expense of tomorrow's reputation.

The CEOs who build lasting companies understand this dynamic and choose integrity even when it's costly, knowing that the compounding returns over decades far exceed the short-term gains from compromise.

## How Integrity Compounds

### The Compounding Mechanism

**Year 1:** You keep a commitment that's costly to keep
**Year 2:** That party trusts you more; tells others
**Year 5:** You're known for keeping commitments
**Year 10:** Opportunities come to you because of that reputation
**Year 20:** Your integrity is an assumed fact; it precedes you
**Year 30:** Integrity becomes institutional legacy

**The pattern:** Each integrity choice builds on the last. The compound effect is enormous.

### The Opposite Compound

**Year 1:** You break a commitment to save money
**Year 2:** That party trusts you less; tells others
**Year 5:** You're known for unreliability
**Year 10:** Opportunities bypass you
**Year 20:** Your reputation is damaged; requires constant defense
**Year 30:** Negative reputation is institutional legacy

**The pattern:** Each integrity violation compounds negatively. Damage accumulates.

## The Short-Term vs. Long-Term Tension

### Where Integrity Costs in the Short Term

**Keeping unprofitable commitments:**
- You promised X; circumstances changed
- Keeping the promise costs money
- Short-term: Worse financials
- Long-term: Reputation for reliability

**Admitting mistakes:**
- You made an error
- Covering it up might work
- Short-term: Avoid embarrassment
- Long-term: Build trust through honesty

**Honest reporting:**
- Results are disappointing
- You could spin them positively
- Short-term: Better narrative
- Long-term: Credibility preserved

**Turning down profitable but questionable deals:**
- Opportunity exists
- Ethics are borderline
- Short-term: Revenue foregone
- Long-term: Reputation protected

### The Patience Requirement

**Integrity requires:**
- Accepting short-term costs
- Trusting long-term returns
- Resisting pressure for immediate results
- Patience while reputation builds

**Short-term pressure opposes:**
- Quarterly earnings focus
- Impatient capital
- Competitive pressure
- Career incentives

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Buffett and GEICO

When Buffett's GEICO investment struggled in the 1970s:

**The short-term pressure:**
- Company nearly went bankrupt
- Easy to cut and run
- Short-term losses would worsen

**The long game:**
- Buffett supported the company through crisis
- Maintained relationship with management
- Demonstrated patient capital

**The result:** Eventually acquired GEICO entirely. Massive long-term returns. Relationship and reputation built.

### Case 2: Solomon Brothers — The Cost of Losing Integrity

**The lesson:** Short-term gains from dishonesty often become catastrophic long-term costs.

### Case 3: Costco's Integrity Premium
