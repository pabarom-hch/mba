# Q1: THINK — Mental Models & Decision-Making

> "The first rule is that you can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang 'em back. If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form." — Charlie Munger

## Quarter Overview

**Duration:** Weeks 1-13
**Theme:** THINK — How to Think Clearly and Decide Wisely
**Primary Mentors:** Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett

---

## The Foundation

Before you can lead others, you must learn to think clearly. Most failures in leadership are failures in thinking—cognitive biases, narrow frameworks, short-term orientation, and the inability to see situations from multiple angles.

This quarter builds your mental toolkit. You will learn to:

- Build a latticework of mental models from multiple disciplines
- Identify and avoid cognitive biases that distort judgment
- Apply inversion—solving problems backwards
- Think in decades, not days
- Operate within your circle of competence
- Make decisions that compound over time

Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett have spent 60+ years refining how they think. This quarter distills their wisdom into daily practice.

## The Two Mentors

### Charlie Munger: The Thinker's Thinker

Munger brings the architecture of thought. His contribution is **how to think**:
- Mental models drawn from every discipline
- The psychology of human misjudgment
- Inversion as a problem-solving tool
- Intellectual humility

Munger believed that "worldly wisdom" comes from carrying models from many disciplines and applying them in combination. A single framework is a hammer that makes every problem look like a nail.

**Reading:** Poor Charlie's Almanack (Weeks 1-6)

### Warren Buffett: The Applied Philosopher

Buffett brings the application of clear thinking to business and life. His contribution is **what clear thinking produces**:
- Long-term orientation
- Integrity and reputation
- Circle of competence
- The power of compounding

Buffett is Munger's thinking in action—demonstrated over decades of decisions that compound in value.

**Reading:** The Essays of Warren Buffett (Weeks 7-13)

## Core Concepts

### Mental Models
A mental model is a framework for understanding how something works. Munger advocates carrying models from many disciplines:
- **Economics:** Supply/demand, incentives, competitive dynamics
- **Psychology:** Cognitive biases, incentives, social proof
- **Physics:** Critical mass, equilibrium, feedback loops
- **Biology:** Evolution, adaptation, ecosystems
- **Mathematics:** Compounding, probability, inversion

No single model captures reality. Using multiple models in combination approaches truth.

### Inversion
Instead of asking "How do I succeed?" ask "How would I fail?" Then avoid those things. Inversion reveals risks and obstacles that forward-thinking misses.

### Circle of Competence
You don't have to be expert in everything—but you must know where your expertise ends. Operating outside your circle of competence without humility is how smart people do dumb things.

### Long-Term Thinking
Buffett's edge is time horizon. While others optimize for quarters, he optimizes for decades. This changes which decisions look good.

### Compounding
Not just money—knowledge, relationships, reputation, and capability all compound. Small advantages, maintained over time, become enormous.

## Quarter Objectives

By the end of Q1, you will:

1. **Have internalized 15+ mental models** and applied them to real decisions
2. **Recognize cognitive biases** in yourself and others
3. **Practice inversion** as a standard problem-solving tool
4. **Define your circle of competence** and respect its boundaries
5. **Shift your time horizon** toward long-term thinking
6. **Begin compounding** in knowledge and relationships

---

## Application Framework

Each week's principles should be applied to your current CEO challenges:

**Strategic Decisions**
- Which mental models apply to this decision?
- What does inversion reveal about the risks?
- Is this within my circle of competence?

**Team Leadership**
- What cognitive biases might be affecting my team?
- Are our incentives aligned with desired behavior?
- Are we thinking long-term or short-term?

**Personal Development**
- What am I compounding this week?
- Where am I operating outside my competence?
- What would Munger and Buffett do in my situation?

---

## Success Indicators

You're succeeding in Q1 if:

- [ ] You catch yourself invoking mental models in real decisions
- [ ] You notice cognitive biases before they distort your judgment
- [ ] You use inversion when facing difficult problems
- [ ] You're more comfortable saying "I don't know"
- [ ] Your time horizon has expanded
- [ ] You're reading widely across disciplines

## Transition to Q2

Q1 teaches you how to think. Q2 teaches you how to build.

With clear thinking established, you're ready to learn from Carnegie and Hill about constructing organizations and achieving wealth. The mental models from Q1 will serve as evaluation criteria for the building principles of Q2.

*"Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Systematically you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. Nevertheless, you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day—if you live long enough—most people get what they deserve."* — Charlie Munger
