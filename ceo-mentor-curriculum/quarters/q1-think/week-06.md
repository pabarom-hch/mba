# Week 6: The Psychology of Misjudgment — Part 3

**Quarter:** Q1 — THINK
**Mentor:** Charlie Munger
**Theme:** Understanding cognitive biases 17-25 and how they combine

> "The combination greatly increases power to change behavior, compared to the power of merely one tendency acting alone." — Charlie Munger

## Overview

This week completes our study of Munger's 25 causes of human misjudgment. More importantly, we'll explore how these biases combine to create exponentially powerful effects—what Munger calls "lollapalooza effects."

Understanding combination effects is crucial. A single bias might nudge behavior; multiple biases working together can make terrible decisions feel inevitable.

20. Drug-Misinfluence Tendency
21. Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency
22. Authority-Misinfluence Tendency
23. Twaddle Tendency
24. Reason-Respecting Tendency
25. Lollapalooza Tendency (combination effects)

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Stress-Influence Tendency
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Light stress can slightly improve performance. Heavy stress causes dysfunction."

**The Bias:** Under stress, we revert to familiar patterns, make hasty decisions, and lose nuanced thinking. Performance degrades, but we often don't notice.

**Reflection Prompt:**
How do you behave under heavy stress? What decisions have you made while stressed that you later regretted?

**CEO Application:**
Identify your stress signals (physical, behavioral). Create a rule: No significant decisions when stress is elevated. Build in cooling-off periods.

---

### Day 2 — Availability Misweighing
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The brain overweighs what's easily available."

**The Bias:** We give disproportionate weight to information that's easily recalled—recent events, vivid stories, personal experience. Statistical base rates get ignored.

**Reflection Prompt:**
What recent event might be distorting your current judgment? Are you overweighting vivid anecdotes over base rate data?

**CEO Application:**
Before a major decision, explicitly ask: What data am I missing because it's not vivid or recent? What would a proper statistical analysis show?

---

### Day 3 — Authority Misinfluence
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Humans are easily influenced by authority figures."

**The Bias:** We defer to authority, even when authorities are wrong or operating outside their competence. Titles and status distort our evaluation of ideas.

**Reflection Prompt:**
Whose opinions do you accept without sufficient scrutiny because of their status? Where might you be the authority figure distorting others' judgment?

**CEO Application:**
As CEO, your statements carry disproportionate weight. Be explicit about confidence levels. Say "I think" vs. "I know." Encourage pushback.

---

### Day 4 — Reason-Respecting Tendency
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Giving people a reason increases compliance, even if the reason is weak."

**The Bias:** We're more likely to comply with requests that include a reason—even a trivial one. The word "because" triggers compliance.

**Reflection Prompt:**
Do your directives include clear reasoning? Do you accept others' directives without examining the reasons?

**CEO Application:**
Always explain why. "We need this report because..." even if the reason seems obvious. It dramatically increases buy-in and execution quality.

---

### Day 5 — The Lollapalooza Effect
**Morning Meditation:**
> "When multiple biases combine, you get extreme effects."

**The Principle:** Individual biases are manageable. But when several reinforce each other, they create "lollapalooza effects"—outcomes wildly out of proportion to any single cause.

**Example:** The Milgram experiments combined authority-influence, social proof, commitment/consistency, and reciprocity to get ordinary people to administer (fake) painful shocks.

**Reflection Prompt:**
Where might multiple biases be combining in your organization to create outsized effects—positive or negative?

**CEO Application:**
Analyze a past failure or success. Map the biases at work. Were multiple biases reinforcing each other? What was the combination?

---

### Day 6 — Designing Against Bias
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The best way to avoid stupid is to know where stupid comes from."

**Synthesis:** You now know 25 causes of misjudgment. The goal isn't to eliminate them (impossible) but to design systems that account for them.

**Reflection Prompt:**
What structural changes could you make to your decision-making processes to counteract the biases you're most susceptible to?

**CEO Application:**
Choose one process (hiring, strategy review, investment decisions). Redesign it to include at least two bias-counteracting mechanisms.

---

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

**Review Questions:**
1. Which combination of biases is most dangerous in your context?
2. How might authority-influence be distorting your team's input to you?
3. What system could you build to counteract availability bias in decisions?
4. What was your key insight from the three weeks on misjudgment?

**Weekly Synthesis:**
Write a summary of the top 5 biases you need to watch in yourself.

### Personal Bias Profile

Based on three weeks of study, create your personal bias profile:

**Part 1: My Top 5 Susceptibilities**
Rank the biases you're most susceptible to:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**Part 2: My Warning Signals**

| Bias | Warning Signal | Counter-Measure |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1. | | |
| 2. | | |
| 3. | | |
| 4. | | |
| 5. | | |

**Part 3: Dangerous Combinations**
What combinations of biases are most likely to affect you?

Combination 1: _______ + _______ =

Combination 2: _______ + _______ =
When this might happen:

**Part 4: System Design**
Design one new process or rule that will protect against your bias vulnerabilities.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Stress degrades judgment.** Build in delays for important decisions during stressful periods.

2. **What's available isn't what's important.** Seek data beyond the vivid and recent.

3. **Authority distorts.** Both yours and others'. Design for pushback.

4. **Reasons increase compliance.** Always explain the "why."

5. **Combinations are dangerous.** Watch for lollapalooza effects where multiple biases reinforce.

6. **Systems beat willpower.** Design processes that counteract predictable biases.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"One of the great defenses against error is to have a full kit of mental models and to use them routinely."* — Charlie Munger

You've now spent three weeks studying how the human mind systematically errs. You can't uninstall these biases, but you can:

- Recognize them when they're operating
- Build decision systems that counteract them
- Create cultures where bias-checking is normal
- Surround yourself with people who will challenge your blind spots

The CEO who understands human psychology—including their own—makes fewer catastrophic errors. And avoiding catastrophic errors is often more valuable than brilliant strokes.
