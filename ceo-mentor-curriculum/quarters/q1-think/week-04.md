# Week 4: The Psychology of Misjudgment — Part 1

**Quarter:** Q1 — THINK
**Mentor:** Charlie Munger
**Theme:** Understanding cognitive biases 1-8

> "The psychology of misjudgment is a terribly important thing to learn." — Charlie Munger

---

## Overview

Charlie Munger identified 25 standard causes of human misjudgment. Over the next three weeks, we'll study these cognitive biases and learn to recognize them in ourselves and others.

This week covers the first eight biases. Understanding these isn't academic—these biases affect your decisions, your team's behavior, and your customers' choices every day.

## The Eight Biases This Week

1. Reward and Punishment Super-Response Tendency
2. Liking/Loving Tendency
3. Disliking/Hating Tendency
4. Doubt-Avoidance Tendency
5. Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency
6. Curiosity Tendency
7. Kantian Fairness Tendency
8. Envy/Jealousy Tendency

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Reward and Punishment Super-Response
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives."

**The Bias:** People respond dramatically to incentives. Whatever you reward, you get more of—intended or not. Behavior follows incentives with remarkable precision.

**Reflection Prompt:**
Where in your organization might incentives be producing unintended behaviors? What do people actually get rewarded for (not what the policy says)?

**CEO Application:**
Audit one incentive structure in your organization today. Map: What behavior is it supposed to produce? What behavior does it actually produce? What would need to change?

### Day 2 — Liking/Loving Tendency
**Morning Meditation:**
> "A newly arrived human is born to like and love, with the aid of their parents."

**The Bias:** We distort facts to favor people and things we like. We ignore faults, comply with wishes, and favor associated things (halo effect).

**Reflection Prompt:**
Is there someone on your team whose flaws you minimize because you like them personally? Are there business ideas you favor because you like who proposed them?

**CEO Application:**
When evaluating your next proposal, explicitly separate the idea from the person presenting it. Would you feel the same if it came from someone you liked less?

### Day 3 — Disliking/Hating Tendency
**Morning Meditation:**
> "We also ignore virtues in the things and people we dislike."

**The Bias:** The opposite of liking bias. We distort facts to disfavor people and things we dislike. We find fault where there is none and dismiss valid contributions.

**Reflection Prompt:**
Is there someone whose ideas you dismiss too quickly because you don't like them? A competitor you underestimate because of personal distaste?

**CEO Application:**
Identify someone (person or company) you instinctively dislike. List three things they do well that you could learn from. Notice your resistance.

---

### Day 4 — Doubt-Avoidance Tendency
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision."

**The Bias:** Uncertainty is uncomfortable. We rush to conclusions to eliminate doubt, often before we have adequate information. First conclusions tend to stick.

**Reflection Prompt:**
When do you feel the urge to decide quickly just to resolve uncertainty? What decisions have you rushed that deserved more deliberation?

**CEO Application:**
For the next significant decision, deliberately delay by 24 hours after you think you've decided. Use that time to test your conclusion. Does it hold?

### Day 5 — Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The brain conserves programming space by being reluctant to change."

**The Bias:** Once we've committed to an idea or course of action, we resist changing it—even in the face of contradictory evidence. Sunk costs trap us.

**Reflection Prompt:**
What positions or decisions are you defending past their expiration date? Where has new information emerged that you're ignoring because it contradicts previous commitments?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one "sacred cow" in your organization—something that continues because "that's how we've always done it." Examine it fresh. Does it still make sense?

### Day 6 — Curiosity, Fairness, and Envy
**Morning Meditation:**
> "It is not greed that drives the world, but envy."

**Three Biases:**
- **Curiosity Tendency:** Humans naturally seek to understand. Harness this.
- **Kantian Fairness Tendency:** We expect reciprocal fairness and are outraged when violated.
- **Envy/Jealousy Tendency:** We compare ourselves to others and suffer when they have what we want.

**Reflection Prompt:**
Where might envy be driving decisions—yours or your team's? What are you doing to "keep up" rather than to create genuine value?

**CEO Application:**
Examine your competitive strategy. How much is driven by genuine opportunity vs. envy of competitors? Are you chasing their game or playing your own?

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

**Review Questions:**
1. Which bias from this week do you recognize most strongly in yourself?
2. Where did you catch a bias in action this week (yours or someone else's)?
3. How might you restructure a system to account for one of these biases?
4. What decision might you revisit knowing about these biases?

**Weekly Synthesis:**
Write 2-3 sentences on how cognitive biases have affected your leadership.

## Application Exercise

### Bias Audit

For each bias covered this week, identify one instance in your organization:

| Bias | Where I See It | Impact | What I Could Change |
|------|----------------|--------|---------------------|
| Incentive Super-Response | | | |
| Liking Tendency | | | |
| Disliking Tendency | | | |
| Doubt-Avoidance | | | |
| Inconsistency-Avoidance | | | |
| Envy/Jealousy | | | |

Choose one to address this week. What specifically will you do?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Incentives rule behavior.** Get the incentives right, and desired behavior follows. Get them wrong, and no amount of exhortation helps.

2. **Liking and disliking distort judgment.** Separate the message from the messenger when evaluating ideas.

3. **We rush to eliminate doubt.** Comfort with uncertainty leads to better decisions. Delay judgment when appropriate.

4. **We resist changing course.** Update beliefs and strategies when evidence warrants, even when it's painful.

5. **Envy is powerful and hidden.** Watch for it in yourself and your organization. It drives more behavior than most realize.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there."* — Charlie Munger

These biases are universal. Your team has them. Your board has them. Your customers have them. And you have them.

The advantage goes not to those who transcend human psychology (impossible) but to those who understand it well enough to design around it. Build systems that work with human nature, not against it.
