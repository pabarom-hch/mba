# Week 3: Circle of Competence

**Quarter:** Q1 — THINK
**Mentor:** Charlie Munger & Warren Buffett
**Theme:** Knowing what you know—and what you don't

> "Knowing what you don't know is more useful than being brilliant." — Charlie Munger

## Overview

The circle of competence is deceptively simple: know what you truly understand, and stay within those boundaries. When you venture outside, proceed with humility and expert help.

This isn't about limiting yourself. It's about honest self-assessment. The biggest disasters come from smart people operating confidently outside their actual expertise.

Buffett famously passed on technology investments for decades—not because he thought tech was bad, but because he honestly didn't understand it well enough. When he finally invested in Apple, it was because he understood consumer behavior, not chip architecture.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Defining Your Circle
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Know your circle of competence, and stick within it. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What do you truly understand at a deep level? What topics could you explain to a child, answer follow-up questions on, and apply to novel situations?

**CEO Application:**
List the 5 domains where your expertise is genuine and deep. Be honest—exclude areas where you know the vocabulary but not the substance.

---

### Day 2 — The Edges of Competence
**Morning Meditation:**
> "There are a lot of things we pass on. We have three baskets: in, out, and too tough."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What business decisions have you made outside your genuine expertise? What was the outcome? Were you lucky or skilled?

**CEO Application:**
For decisions in your "out" or "too tough" basket, who could you bring in whose circle of competence covers that area?

---

### Day 3 — The Ego Problem
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The desire to get rich fast is one of the greatest causes of failure."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Where does your ego push you to pretend expertise you don't have? Where do you nod along in meetings when you don't actually understand?

**CEO Application:**
This week, practice saying "I don't understand that well enough—can you explain?" Notice how it changes conversations.

---

### Day 4 — Expanding vs. Respecting the Circle
**Morning Meditation:**
> "I've had a very limited, focused approach, and it's worked well."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What's the difference between appropriately expanding your competence (learning) and inappropriately operating outside it (overreach)?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one area outside your current competence that genuinely matters for your business. Create a learning plan to bring it inside your circle over the next 6-12 months.

---

### Day 5 — Surrogate Competence
**Morning Meditation:**
> "It's not about having a large circle of competence, but knowing where the perimeter lies."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Who on your team or in your network has competence you lack? How well do you leverage their expertise?

**CEO Application:**
Map your team's circles of competence. Where are the gaps? Where do circles overlap (redundancy) or not touch critical areas (exposure)?

---

### Day 6 — The Humility Dividend
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Acknowledging what you don't know is the dawning of wisdom."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Think of a leader you respect. How do they handle areas outside their competence? What can you learn from their approach?

**CEO Application:**
In your next meeting where you're out of your depth, lead with questions rather than opinions. Note how the dynamic changes.

---

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

**Review Questions:**
1. How clearly can you define your circle of competence now versus at the beginning of the week?
2. Where did you catch yourself operating outside your circle?
3. What will you do differently now when facing decisions outside your competence?
4. Who do you need to rely on more for areas outside your circle?

**Weekly Synthesis:**
Write 2-3 sentences capturing your understanding of your own circle of competence.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The circle is about honesty.** It's a tool for self-assessment, not self-limitation.

2. **The perimeter matters most.** Knowing where your competence ends prevents costly errors.

3. **Size doesn't matter.** A small circle, well-known, beats a large circle poorly defined.

4. **Ego is the enemy.** The urge to appear knowledgeable extends people beyond their competence.

5. **Build surrogate competence.** You can't know everything; build a team and network that together covers critical ground.

## Warning Signs of Operating Outside Your Circle

- You can't explain why something works, just that it does
- You use jargon but can't define terms simply
- You can't answer "why" more than two levels deep
- You defer to authority without evaluating the reasoning
- You feel excited by novelty rather than understanding
- Your confidence exceeds your ability to predict outcomes

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"The most important thing in terms of your circle of competence is not how large the area of it is, but how well you've defined the perimeter."* — Warren Buffett

The CEO role requires decisions across every function. You will never be expert in all of them. This isn't a weakness to hide; it's a reality to manage.

The wise CEO builds a team that collectively covers the necessary competencies, knows when to ask questions vs. offer opinions, and has the humility to say "I don't know."

Your team will respect honesty more than false expertise.
