# Week 1: The Latticework of Mental Models

**Quarter:** Q1 — THINK
**Mentor:** Charlie Munger
**Theme:** Building a toolkit of mental models from multiple disciplines

> "You've got to have models in your head. And you've got to array your experience—both vicarious and direct—on this latticework of models." — Charlie Munger

---

## Overview

This week introduces the foundational concept of mental models—the frameworks we use to understand and navigate reality. Munger argues that relying on a single discipline or framework is like having only a hammer: every problem looks like a nail.

The solution is to build a "latticework" of models from multiple disciplines—psychology, economics, physics, biology, mathematics, engineering—and apply them in combination. No single model captures reality, but multiple models triangulate toward truth.

As a CEO, you face complex problems that can't be solved by business frameworks alone. This week, you begin building a cross-disciplinary mental toolkit.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — The Danger of Single Models
**Morning Meditation:**
> "To a man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What framework or lens do you default to when analyzing problems? Finance? Operations? Marketing? Consider how this default might blind you to important aspects of situations.

**CEO Application:**
In your next meeting, notice which framework your team defaults to. Are there perspectives being systematically ignored because no one in the room carries that model?

### Day 2 — The Power of Multiple Models
**Morning Meditation:**
> "You can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang 'em back. If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Think of a recent complex decision. How many different mental models did you apply? What models might have revealed insights you missed?

**CEO Application:**
Before your next significant decision, deliberately apply at least three different mental models. Write down what each reveals.

---

### Day 3 — The Economics Model: Incentives
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Who in your organization has incentives misaligned with what you want them to do? Where might your own incentives be causing blind spots?

**CEO Application:**
Map the incentives of your top 5 stakeholders. What behavior does each incentive structure actually encourage (not what it's intended to encourage)?

---

### Day 4 — The Psychology Model: Social Proof
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Where in your business or industry are you following the crowd without independent analysis? What would happen if the crowd is wrong?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one decision you've made recently because "that's what everyone does" or "that's industry standard." Re-examine it from first principles.

---

### Day 5 — The Physics Model: Critical Mass
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Big effects can come from small, continuous causes that reach a threshold."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What in your business might be approaching a tipping point—either positive or negative? What would push it over the threshold?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one area where consistent small investments could compound to a breakthrough. Are you investing consistently, or starting and stopping?

---

### Day 6 — The Biology Model: Evolution and Adaptation
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The species that survives is not the strongest or the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change."

**Reflection Prompt:**
How well does your organization adapt to changing conditions? Are there areas where you're optimized for an environment that no longer exists?

**CEO Application:**
Identify one process or practice that was designed for conditions that have changed. What would it look like redesigned for current reality?

---

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

**Review Questions:**
1. Which mental model from this week resonated most strongly? Why?
2. Where did you successfully apply a new model to a real situation?
3. What disciplines are underrepresented in your current thinking?
4. How might you systematically expand your model toolkit?

**Weekly Synthesis:**
Write 2-3 sentences capturing your key insight from this week.

## Reading Assignment

**Primary:** Poor Charlie's Almanack — Introduction and "Elementary Worldly Wisdom"
Focus on the section where Munger describes the latticework approach.

**Optional:** Begin listing mental models you already use and identifying disciplines you want to learn from.

---

## Application Exercise

### Building Your Model Inventory

Create a document titled "My Mental Models."

**Part 1: Current Inventory**
List all the frameworks and models you currently use when thinking about problems. Categorize them by discipline:
- Business/Strategy:
- Finance:
- Psychology:
- Engineering/Systems:
- Other:

**Part 2: Gap Analysis**
Based on Munger's approach, which disciplines are missing or underrepresented?
- Economics:
- Psychology:
- Physics:
- Biology:
- Mathematics:
- History:
- Philosophy:

**Part 3: Learning Plan**
Choose one underrepresented discipline. Identify one book or resource to begin learning its core models. When will you start?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Single models are dangerous.** Relying on one framework creates blind spots and distorts judgment.

2. **Multiple models triangulate truth.** Combining perspectives from different disciplines approaches a more complete picture.

3. **Mental models must be organized.** A "latticework" structure allows models to connect and reinforce each other.

4. **Building takes time.** A robust mental toolkit is developed over years of deliberate study across disciplines.

5. **Models are tools, not truths.** All models are simplifications. Useful, but never complete.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"The best thing a human being can do is to help another human being know more."* — Charlie Munger

As CEO, your job is not to have all the answers but to ask better questions and think more clearly. The latticework of mental models gives you the vocabulary and frameworks to do so.

Start building your toolkit today. Your decisions will improve, your team's thinking will elevate, and your capacity to navigate complexity will expand.
