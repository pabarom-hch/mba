# Week 9: Economic Moats

**Quarter:** Q1 — THINK
**Mentor:** Warren Buffett
**Theme:** Building and defending competitive advantages

> "In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats." — Warren Buffett

---

## Overview

Buffett's metaphor of the economic moat has become central to strategic thinking. A moat is a sustainable competitive advantage—something that protects your business from competition and erosion.

This week examines the types of moats, how to identify them, and—most importantly for CEOs—how to widen them.

---

## Types of Economic Moats

1. **Brand/Reputation** — Customer trust and recognition
2. **Network Effects** — Value increases with each user
3. **Cost Advantages** — Structural ability to produce cheaper
4. **Switching Costs** — Pain of changing to a competitor
5. **Intangible Assets** — Patents, licenses, proprietary tech
6. **Efficient Scale** — Market only supports one or few players

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Identifying Your Moat
**Morning Meditation:**

**Reflection Prompt:**
What is your company's competitive advantage? Is it truly durable, or could it be replicated in 3-5 years?

**CEO Application:**
Draw your economic moat. What protects your business from competition? How wide is it? How deep?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Moats matter more than growth.** A fast-growing company without a moat is running on a treadmill.

2. **Moats are attacked constantly.** The dynamics of capitalism ensure competitors will try to cross your moat.

3. **Widening beats defending.** The best defense is a moat that gets wider over time.

4. **Different businesses have different moats.** Know which type yours is and invest accordingly.

5. **Time reveals moat quality.** True moats strengthen over decades; false moats erode quickly.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"The most important thing to do when you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging."* — Warren Buffett

Your job as CEO is to be the "honest lord in charge of the castle." You must understand your moat, defend it relentlessly, and invest in widening it.

Don't confuse activity with moat-building. Many initiatives generate revenue without strengthening competitive position. The best CEOs distinguish between the two and prioritize accordingly.
