# Week 11: Integrity as Strategy

**Quarter:** Q1 — THINK
**Mentor:** Warren Buffett
**Theme:** Reputation as competitive advantage

> "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently." — Warren Buffett

## Overview

For Buffett, integrity isn't just a moral imperative—it's a strategic advantage. Trust compounds over decades. A reputation for honest dealing attracts better partners, customers, and employees. The integrity premium is real and measurable.

This week examines integrity not as a constraint on business but as a competitive weapon.

## Buffett's Hiring Filter

*"In looking for someone to hire, look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if they don't have the first, the other two will kill you."*

The same applies to partnerships, acquisitions, and promotions. Intelligence and energy without integrity creates sophisticated destruction.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless."* — Warren Buffett (to Salomon employees)

The CEO is the chief guardian of organizational integrity. Your personal conduct sets the standard. Your response to violations defines the culture. Your strategic choices signal what matters.

Build reputation deliberately. Protect it obsessively. And remember: the cheapest time to protect reputation is before it's damaged.
