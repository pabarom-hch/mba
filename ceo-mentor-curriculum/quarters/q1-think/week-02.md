# Week 2: Inversion — Solving Problems Backwards

**Quarter:** Q1 — THINK
**Mentor:** Charlie Munger
**Theme:** The power of thinking backwards to think clearly

> "Invert, always invert." — Carl Jacobi (mathematician), frequently quoted by Munger

---

## Overview

Inversion is one of Munger's most powerful thinking tools. Instead of asking "How do I achieve success?" ask "How would I guarantee failure?" Then avoid those things.

This backwards approach reveals obstacles, risks, and failure modes that forward-thinking misses. It's counterintuitive but remarkably effective.

The mathematicians use inversion constantly. Prove something is true by assuming it's false and finding a contradiction. Munger brought this to business and life.

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — The Case for Backwards Thinking
**Morning Meditation:**
> "It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What if your goal this year wasn't to be brilliant, but to avoid being stupid? What would you stop doing?

**CEO Application:**
List three ways your company could fail in the next year. Now examine: Are any of these failure modes currently active?

### Day 2 — Avoiding Stupidity
**Morning Meditation:**
> "It is not greed that drives the world, but envy."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Where might envy be driving decisions in your organization? What choices are being made to "keep up" rather than to create genuine value?

**CEO Application:**
Before your next strategic decision, explicitly list the ways it could fail. Redesign to avoid those failure modes.

### Day 3 — The Pre-Mortem
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The best way to avoid failure is to study failure."

**Reflection Prompt:**
Think of a failed initiative or decision in the past. What did the "post-mortem" reveal? Could a "pre-mortem" have predicted it?

**CEO Application:**
For your next major initiative, run a pre-mortem: Assume it's one year later and the project failed spectacularly. Write the story of why. Now prevent that story.

### Day 4 — What Would a Smart Enemy Do?
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Always ask: What could go wrong? How could this fail?"

**Reflection Prompt:**
If a brilliant competitor wanted to destroy your business, how would they do it? What vulnerabilities would they exploit?

**CEO Application:**
Spend 15 minutes thinking like your smartest competitor. What strategy would you use to take market share from your company? Now defend against it.

### Day 5 — Inverting Goals
**Morning Meditation:**
> "All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there."

**Reflection Prompt:**
What is your most important goal right now? Invert it: What would guarantee you never achieve it? Are you doing any of those things?

**CEO Application:**
Take your company's top strategic priority. List 10 ways to ensure it fails. Review the list—how many of those things are happening?

### Day 6 — Inversion in Daily Decisions
**Morning Meditation:**
> "A lot of success in life comes from knowing what you really want to avoid—like early death, a bad marriage, etc."

**Reflection Prompt:**
In your daily work, what should you avoid doing as much as what you should do? What habits or behaviors consistently lead to poor outcomes?

**CEO Application:**
Create a "not to-do" list alongside your to-do list. What actions, habits, or tendencies consistently hurt your effectiveness?

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

**Review Questions:**
1. Where did you apply inversion this week? What did it reveal?
2. What failure modes did you identify that you hadn't previously considered?
3. How could you make inversion a standard part of your decision-making process?
4. What on your "not to-do" list is hardest to avoid? Why?

**Weekly Synthesis:**
Write 2-3 sentences capturing your key insight from inversion thinking.

## Application Exercise

### The CEO Failure Analysis

**Part 1: Your Failure Modes**
List 10 ways you could fail as a CEO in the next 3 years. Be specific and honest.

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.
10.

**Part 2: Current Status**
For each failure mode, rate how actively present it is today (1-10):
- 1-3: Not currently a risk
- 4-6: Some warning signs
- 7-10: Actively happening

**Part 3: Prevention Plan**
For any item rated 5 or higher, what specific action will prevent this failure mode from materializing?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Forward thinking has blind spots.** We naturally focus on what we want, not what could go wrong.

2. **Inversion reveals risks.** Asking "how could this fail?" surfaces obstacles that optimism conceals.

3. **Avoiding stupidity beats seeking brilliance.** Consistent avoidance of errors compounds into superior results.

4. **Pre-mortems prevent post-mortems.** Imagining failure in advance allows you to prevent it.

5. **Inversion is a skill.** It feels unnatural at first but becomes automatic with practice.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"The iron rule of nature is: you get what you reward for. If you want ants to come, you put sugar on the floor."* — Charlie Munger

As a CEO, your organization is a complex system. Inversion helps you see how your incentives, decisions, and structures might be producing the opposite of what you intend.

The CEO who masters inversion makes fewer catastrophic errors. And in business, avoiding catastrophe is often more important than achieving brilliance.
