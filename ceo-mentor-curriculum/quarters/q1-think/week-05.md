# Week 5: The Psychology of Misjudgment — Part 2

**Quarter:** Q1 — THINK
**Mentor:** Charlie Munger
**Theme:** Understanding cognitive biases 9-16

> "The human mind is a lot like the human egg, and the human egg has a shut-off device. One sperm gets in, and it shuts down so the next one can't get in. The human mind has a big tendency of the same sort." — Charlie Munger

## Overview

Continuing our study of Munger's 25 causes of human misjudgment, this week covers biases 9-16. These tendencies shape how we interpret information, respond to authority, and deal with stress.

As a CEO, you'll see these biases operating constantly—in negotiations, team dynamics, customer behavior, and your own decision-making.

15. Social-Proof Tendency
16. Contrast-Misreaction Tendency

## Daily Practice

### Day 1 — Reciprocation Tendency
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The automatic tendency to reciprocate both favors and disfavors has long been noticed as extreme."

**The Bias:** We feel compelled to repay favors and retaliate against slights. This can be exploited (give before asking) or create destructive cycles (revenge spirals).

**Reflection Prompt:**
Who have you agreed with or helped recently primarily because they helped you first? Where might you be in a negative reciprocity spiral with someone?

**CEO Application:**
Consider your key relationships (investors, partners, customers). Are any being maintained through reciprocity rather than genuine value? What's the long-term risk?

### Day 2 — Influence from Mere Association
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The Persian messenger who brought bad news was executed. This led to a tendency of Persian messengers to not deliver bad news."

**The Bias:** We transfer our feelings about one thing to associated things. Bad news messengers get blamed. Products associated with celebrities seem better.

**Reflection Prompt:**
How easy is it for people to bring you bad news? Have you ever "shot the messenger"? What signals might you be sending?

**CEO Application:**
Create an explicit channel for bad news that rewards rather than punishes the messenger. Examine whether you've inadvertently trained people to hide problems.

### Day 3 — Pain-Avoiding Denial & Excessive Self-Regard
**Morning Meditation:**
> "We all overestimate ourselves. Ninety percent of Swedish drivers think they are above average."

**Two Biases:**
- **Denial:** We reject painful realities by refusing to see them.
- **Self-Regard:** We overestimate our abilities and contributions.

**Reflection Prompt:**
What unpleasant reality might you be denying? What evidence exists that you're conveniently ignoring? In what areas might you overestimate yourself?

**CEO Application:**
Ask three trusted people: "What do I overestimate about myself?" Listen without defending.

---

### Day 4 — Over-Optimism Tendency
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Man tends to have excessive self-regard... coupled with over-optimism."

**The Bias:** We systematically underestimate risks and overestimate our ability to control outcomes. Planning fallacy: everything takes longer and costs more.

**Reflection Prompt:**
What project or initiative are you overly optimistic about? What would a skeptic see that you're missing?

**CEO Application:**
For your current top priority, add 50% to the time estimate and 30% to the cost estimate. Does it still make sense? This isn't pessimism—it's calibration.

---

### Day 5 — Deprival Super-Reaction
**Morning Meditation:**
> "The loss seems to hurt much more than the gain pleases."

**The Bias:** We feel losses about twice as intensely as equivalent gains. Losing $100 hurts more than finding $100 pleases. This makes us irrationally attached to what we have.

**Reflection Prompt:**
What are you holding onto (job, strategy, relationship) primarily because losing it would hurt, not because keeping it is best?

**CEO Application:**
Identify a sunk cost trap in your business—something you're continuing because you've invested heavily, not because it's the best path forward. What would you do if starting fresh?

### Day 6 — Social Proof & Contrast Misreaction
**Morning Meditation:**
> "Everybody's doing it" is an extremely powerful force.

**Two Biases:**
- **Social Proof:** We assume what others do is correct, especially under uncertainty.
- **Contrast Misreaction:** We misjudge things based on what they're compared to, not their absolute value.

**Reflection Prompt:**
Where in your business are you following industry norms without independent analysis? What looks reasonable only because of what it's compared to?

**CEO Application:**
Take a major expense. Remove it from context. Evaluate its absolute value, not relative to similar expenses or to what it was before. Is it worth it?

### Day 7 — Weekly Integration

**Review Questions:**
1. Which bias from this week surprised you most?
2. Where did you observe social proof in action (yours or others)?
3. What denial might be protecting you from painful but important truths?
4. How might loss aversion be trapping resources in underperforming areas?

**Weekly Synthesis:**
Write 2-3 sentences on how these biases operate in your current business situation.

## Reading Assignment

**Primary:** Poor Charlie's Almanack — "The Psychology of Human Misjudgment" (continued)
**Supplementary:** Influence by Robert Cialdini, Chapters 4-5 (Social Proof, Reciprocity)

## Application Exercise

### The CEO Reality Check

**Part 1: Optimism Calibration**
List your top 3 initiatives. For each:
- Your optimistic estimate (timeline/cost/outcome)
- An adjusted estimate (+50% time, +30% cost)
- Still worth doing?

| Initiative | Optimistic | Adjusted | Still Worth It? |
|-----------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1. | | | |
| 2. | | | |
| 3. | | | |

**Part 2: Loss Aversion Audit**
What are you continuing primarily to avoid the pain of losing, not because it's best?
- Project:
- Relationship:
- Strategy:
- Expense:

What would you do if you started fresh today?

**Part 3: Social Proof Dependency**
List 3 practices you follow because "everyone does it":
1.
2.
3.

Evaluate each on its own merits. Are they actually right for you?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Reciprocity is powerful.** Use it ethically (give first), and watch for exploitation.

2. **Don't punish the messenger.** Create systems that reward uncomfortable truths.

3. **We all overestimate ourselves.** Seek external calibration regularly.

4. **Loss aversion traps resources.** Evaluate sunk costs honestly.

5. **Social proof isn't evidence.** "Everyone does it" is not a strategy.

6. **Comparison distorts value.** Judge things absolutely, not just relatively.

## Mentor's Advice for CEOs

*"We have three baskets: in, out, and too hard."* — Warren Buffett

These biases don't make you weak—they make you human. The difference between mediocre and excellent CEOs isn't the absence of bias but awareness and system design.

Build structures that counteract these tendencies. Reward bad news messengers. Require pre-mortems on optimistic plans. Compare options to alternatives, not just to each other.
