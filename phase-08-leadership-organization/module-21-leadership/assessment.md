## Answer Key

### Section 1: Leadership Theories

**1.** B) Extraversion
*Meta-analysis by Judge et al. found extraversion has the strongest correlation (r=.31) with leadership effectiveness.*

**2.** B) Initiating structure and consideration
*These are the two independent dimensions identified by Ohio State research.*

**3.** C) Supporting
*R3 (able but unwilling/insecure) calls for high supportive, low directive behavior.*

**4.** C) Inspiring followers to transcend self-interest
*Transformational leadership moves beyond exchange-based motivation to values-based inspiration.*

**5.** B) Personal humility and professional will
*Level 5 leaders combine fierce determination with genuine humility.*

**6.** (5 points) Sample Answer:
*Fiedler's Contingency Model proposes that leader effectiveness depends on matching a leader's fixed style to the situation. Unlike Situational Leadership, which suggests leaders should adapt their style to follower readiness, Fiedler argues that leadership style is relatively stable. His model recommends changing the situation to fit the leader (through restructuring tasks or adjusting position power) rather than changing the leader. Situational factors include leader-member relations, task structure, and position power.*

**7.** (5 points) Sample Answer:
- *Idealized Influence (Charisma): Leaders serve as role models. Example: A CEO who takes a pay cut during company hardship.*
- *Inspirational Motivation: Articulating compelling vision. Example: A leader describing how the company will change customers' lives.*
- *Intellectual Stimulation: Challenging followers to think differently. Example: A manager asking "What if we approached this from the customer's perspective?"*

### Section 6: Executive Presence

**27.** C) Gravitas (how you act)
