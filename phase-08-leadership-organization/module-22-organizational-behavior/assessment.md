## Answer Key

### Section 1: Individual Behavior

**1.** C) Recognition
*Recognition is a motivator factor; salary and working conditions are hygiene factors.*

**2.** B) The belief that performance leads to outcomes
*Expectancy is effort→performance; Instrumentality is performance→outcomes; Valence is value of outcomes.*

**3.** C) Conscientiousness
*Research consistently shows conscientiousness as the strongest predictor across occupations.*

**4.** B) Over-attribute others' behavior to personality versus situation
*We tend to see others' behavior as due to their character while excusing our own situational factors.*

**5.** (5 points) Sample Answer:
*Self-Determination Theory identifies three innate needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Shifting from autonomy-based work to rigid monitoring directly undermines the need for autonomy - the need for self-direction and choice in how work is done. When autonomy is removed, intrinsic motivation decreases because the work feels controlled rather than self-directed. Even if pay (an extrinsic motivator) stays the same, the loss of intrinsic motivation through autonomy reduction leads to decreased engagement, satisfaction, and effort. Additionally, monitoring may undermine feelings of competence by signaling distrust.*

**6.** (5 points) Sample Answer:
*The Job Characteristics Model identifies five core characteristics that affect motivation: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. The factory worker doing one small task repeatedly has low skill variety (using few skills), low task identity (not completing a whole product), and potentially low feedback. The worker assembling entire products has higher task identity (completing a whole, identifiable piece of work), higher skill variety (using multiple skills), and likely receives more direct feedback (seeing the completed product). These differences lead to higher experienced meaningfulness of work, resulting in higher motivation for the whole-product assembler.*

### Section 2: Group Dynamics

**7.** B) Storming
*Storming is characterized by conflict over control, influence, and direction.*

**8.** B) Implementer
*Implementers turn ideas into practical action plans. Plants generate creative ideas.*

**9.** B) The leader actively encourages dissent
*Active encouragement of dissent prevents the conformity pressure that leads to groupthink.*

**10.** B) Making individual contributions identifiable
*When individuals know their specific contribution will be recognized, they're less likely to loaf.*

**11.** (8 points) Sample Answer:

a) *The team is in the Forming stage - evidenced by politeness, hesitation, dependence on the leader for decisions, and avoidance of challenging each other.*

b) *Two actions: (1) Create opportunities for team members to share personal backgrounds and build trust (team-building activity). (2) Explicitly encourage and reward speaking up - asking for dissenting views in meetings and thanking people when they share concerns.*

c) *Some conflict (storming) would help because it allows the team to work through disagreements about roles, direction, and norms. Working through conflict builds trust and leads to genuine commitment. Avoiding conflict keeps the team stuck in artificial harmony.*

### Section 3: High-Performing Teams

**12.** B) Absence of trust
*Trust is the foundation; without it, the other dysfunctions cascade.*

**13.** C) Psychological safety
*Project Aristotle found psychological safety was the #1 predictor, more important than who was on the team.*

**14.** B) A shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking
*This is Edmondson's definition - the ability to speak up without fear of negative consequences.*

**15.** (12 points) Sample Answer:

a) *Dysfunctions present:*
- *Absence of trust: Members don't speak up, hide concerns*
- *Fear of conflict: No honest feedback, avoiding difficult conversations*
- *Avoidance of accountability: Blaming others when targets are missed*
- *Inattention to results: Departures suggest individual focus over team outcomes*

b) *Sequence: Trust eroded first (reason for departures), leading to fear of conflict (no honest feedback), which led to lack of commitment (likely unstated), which led to avoidance of accountability (blaming), resulting in inattention to collective results.*

c) *Priority actions: (1) Rebuild trust: Leader should model vulnerability by admitting own mistakes; hold personal history exercise. (2) Address fear of conflict: Establish new norms for productive disagreement; mine for conflict in meetings. (3) Re-establish accountability: Create clear, public goals; implement peer feedback.*

### Section 4: Organizational Culture

**16.** C) Unconscious, taken-for-granted beliefs
*Basic underlying assumptions are the deepest, most invisible level of culture.*

**17.** B) Adhocracy
*Adhocracy cultures emphasize flexibility, innovation, and entrepreneurship.*

**18.** C) Culture change follows behavior change when new behaviors prove successful
*Per Schein, culture changes last, after new behaviors demonstrate success.*

**19.** (10 points) Sample Answer:

a) *Current: Hierarchy culture (internal focus, stability, control, efficiency). Required: Adhocracy culture (external focus, flexibility, innovation, risk-taking). This represents a significant shift on both axes of the Competing Values Framework.*

b) *Two artifacts to change: (1) Decision-making processes (from multilevel approval to delegated authority). (2) Physical workspace (from private offices to open, collaborative spaces with innovation labs).*

c) *Two systems changes: (1) Performance metrics - add innovation metrics (experiments run, speed to market) alongside compliance metrics. (2) Hiring criteria - hire for entrepreneurial mindset and tolerance for ambiguity, not just banking experience.*

### Section 5: Power & Politics

**20.** C) Expert power
*Expert power is based on specialized knowledge and skills.*

**21.** C) Rational persuasion
*Research shows rational persuasion and consultation work best when influencing superiors.*

**22.** B) Technical expertise
*Political skill dimensions are social astuteness, interpersonal influence, networking ability, and apparent sincerity.*

**23.** (10 points) Sample Answer:

a) *Two power sources: (1) Expert power - by becoming the expert on project management best practices and demonstrating how the system improves outcomes. (2) Connection/network power - by building relationships with IT through helping them or finding mutual allies.*

b) *Influence tactics:*
- *Boss: Rational persuasion (data on ROI, case studies) combined with consultation (involving boss in shaping the approach)*
- *IT: Exchange (offer to adjust timeline, help with other priorities) and coalition (get support from other departments first)*
- *Team: Inspirational appeal (how this makes their work easier) and consultation (involve them in selection and implementation)*

### Section 6: Conflict & Negotiation

**24.** B) Leads to better decisions through debate
*Task conflict improves decision quality by surfacing diverse perspectives.*

**25.** D) Collaborating
*Collaborating is high on both assertiveness (own concerns) and cooperativeness (others' concerns).*

**26.** B) The best alternative to a negotiated agreement
*BATNA is what you'll do if negotiation fails - your walkaway option.*

**27.** (10 points) Sample Answer:

a) *Positions and interests:*
- *Marketing: Position = 60% of budget. Likely interests = successful launch, market share gain, revenue growth, career success*
- *Finance: Position = only 40%. Likely interests = meeting cost targets, financial discipline, avoiding risk, budget predictability*

b) *Creative options:*
- *Phase the marketing spend across quarters to match Finance's cash flow needs while still achieving launch goals*
- *Tie additional budget (above 40%) to performance milestones - if early results are strong, release more funds*
- *Find low-cost marketing tactics that achieve impact with less budget, plus Finance provides contingency fund*

c) *Objective criteria: Industry benchmarks for launch spending as % of projected revenue; ROI data from similar past launches; competitor spending levels; customer acquisition cost targets.*
