## Answer Key

### Section 1: Talent Strategy

**1.** C) Structured interviews combined with cognitive ability tests
*Research by Schmidt & Hunter shows these methods have the highest predictive validity (r = .51+) when combined.*

**2.** B) How to source required capabilities
*Build (develop internally), Buy (hire externally), Borrow (contractors/gig), Bot (automate) represents talent sourcing options.*

**3.** B) Highlighting its unique Employee Value Proposition
*EVP differentiates the organization by articulating what makes it unique as an employer, beyond just matching market rates.*

**4.** C) Have high strategic impact and are difficult to fill
*Critical roles are defined by both strategic importance AND talent scarcity, not just seniority or salary.*

**5.** (4 points) Sample Answer:
*Two strategies to improve speed while maintaining quality:*
*1. Build a pre-qualified talent pipeline by engaging passive candidates before roles open - maintaining relationships with qualified candidates so the funnel is already filled when positions open.*
*2. Implement structured interviews with standardized scorecards to enable faster, more consistent hiring decisions while reducing time in the interview stage. This can cut 2-3 weeks from the process while actually improving quality.*

**6.** (4 points) Sample Answer:
*Two sourcing strategies to improve diversity:*
*1. Partner with diversity-focused organizations and attend events at HBCUs, HSIs, and professional associations for underrepresented groups (e.g., NSBE, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers) to access different talent pools.*
*2. Implement blind resume screening to remove bias in initial screening, and ensure diverse interview panels to signal inclusion and reduce bias in selection decisions.*

### Section 2: Performance Management

**7.** B) Quantitative and measurable indicators of progress
*Key Results must be measurable to know when you've achieved the Objective. They answer "How will we know we got there?"*

**8.** B) Situation, Behavior, Impact
*SBI provides a structure for delivering feedback: describe the Situation, the observable Behavior, and the Impact.*

**9.** B) Calibration helps ensure consistent standards across managers
*Calibration aligns managers on what performance levels look like, preventing one manager's "exceeds" from being another's "meets."*

**10.** C) Sustained underperformance continues after coaching
*PIPs are for documented, sustained underperformance after other interventions have been tried, not for one-time issues.*

**11.** (8 points) Sample Answer:

a) *Performance management approach for 200-person startup:*
*- Goal-setting: Implement OKRs at company and team level quarterly, with individual goals aligned to team OKRs. OKRs provide transparency and alignment without being too rigid.*
*- Feedback cadence: Weekly 1:1s between managers and direct reports; monthly goal progress check-ins; quarterly OKR reviews; lightweight semi-annual performance conversations (no formal ratings initially).*
*This balances structure with the flexibility startups need.*

b) *Risks of too-rigid implementation:*
*- May slow decision-making and agility that startups need*
*- Formal ratings could create unhealthy internal competition*
*- Bureaucratic processes may frustrate employees who joined for startup culture*
*- Goals set quarterly may be outdated before the quarter ends in fast-moving environment*
*- May not have enough data for fair calibration across such a small org*

### Section 3: Compensation & Rewards

**12.** B) Is paid 90% of the midpoint for their grade
*Compa-ratio = Actual Salary / Midpoint. 0.90 means paid at 90% of the midpoint, slightly below target.*

**13.** B) Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
*RSUs always have value when they vest (shares x stock price). Options can be "underwater" if stock price falls below strike price.*

**14.** B) Job level, function, location, and experience
*These are legitimate, non-discriminatory factors. Pay equity analysis must NOT include protected characteristics like race or gender as explanatory variables.*

**15.** B) Higher commission rates above quota
*Accelerators increase commission percentages (e.g., 2x rate) after salespeople exceed quota, rewarding top performers.*

**16.** (10 points) Sample Answer:

a) *Root cause: The compensation structure creates an "invisible" problem - while total compensation is competitive, the low base salary (40th percentile) creates perceived underpayment. Employees compare base salaries (often publicly discussed) and feel underpaid, while bonuses and benefits are less visible and feel uncertain.*

b) *Total rewards strategy:*
*1. Shift the pay mix: Increase base salaries toward 50th percentile while reducing target bonus percentage to keep total cash neutral or slightly higher. This addresses the visibility problem without significantly increasing costs.*
*2. Improve total rewards communication: Create personalized total compensation statements showing the full value of salary + bonus + benefits to help employees understand their true compensation.*
*3. Target highest-risk roles: Conduct market pricing for roles with highest turnover and adjust base pay for those roles specifically.*

c) *Communication approach:*
*- Acknowledge that feedback about pay was heard*
*- Share the total compensation framework and how decisions are made*
*- Provide personalized total rewards statements showing full value*
*- Explain changes being made and timeline*
*- Train managers to have compensation conversations*
*- Be transparent about market positioning philosophy*

### Section 4: Learning & Development

**17.** B) On-the-job experience
*The 70-20-10 model indicates 70% of learning comes from experience, 20% from others, 10% from formal training.*

**18.** C) Level 3: Behavior
*Level 3 measures behavior change - whether participants apply learning on the job. Level 2 is knowledge acquisition, Level 4 is business results.*

**19.** B) Reality
*GROW = Goal (what you want), Reality (current situation), Options (what you could do), Will (what you will do).*

**20.** B) Provide advancement for both managers and individual contributors
*Dual career ladders allow technical experts to advance in seniority, pay, and status without becoming managers.*

**21.** (8 points) Sample Answer:

a) *70-20-10 learning strategy for AI skills:*

*70% Experiential (On-the-job):*
*- Pilot programs where employees use AI tools on real work with support*
*- Stretch assignments to solve problems using AI*
*- Learning labs where employees experiment with tools on actual tasks*
*- Project teams mixing AI-skilled and developing employees*

*20% Social (From others):*
*- Peer coaching and buddy systems pairing AI-skilled employees with learners*
*- Communities of practice to share AI use cases and tips*
*- Mentoring from early adopters*
*- Team learning sessions to troubleshoot together*

*10% Formal:*
*- Foundation training on AI concepts and company tools*
*- Vendor training on specific platforms*
*- Certification paths for those wanting deeper expertise*

b) *Effectiveness measurement beyond completion:*
*- Level 3 (Behavior): Track usage of AI tools 30/60/90 days post-training*
*- Level 3: Manager assessments of employees applying new skills*
*- Level 4 (Results): Measure productivity improvements in pilot teams*
*- Level 4: Track error rates, time savings, or quality improvements*
*- Employee confidence surveys on AI competence pre/post*

### Section 5: Succession Planning

**22.** B) High performance and high potential for growth
*The upper right box of the 9-box requires both high current performance AND high potential for future growth.*

**23.** B) Could step into the role immediately and succeed
*"Ready Now" means the successor has the capabilities needed and could take on the role with minimal transition time.*

**24.** B) Ability to grow significantly beyond current role
*Potential is about future capacity to handle larger scope/complexity, not just current performance.*

**25.** C) Two or more successors at different readiness levels
*Best practice is to have multiple successors (Ready Now + Ready 1-2 Years) to provide depth and options.*

**26.** (8 points) Sample Answer:

a) *Development needs for each candidate:*

*Candidate A (CFO):*
*- Needs operational and product leadership experience (has never led these functions)*
*- Should gain broader organizational leadership beyond finance*
*- Needs visibility and relationship building with the broader organization*
*- Recommended: Lead a major cross-functional initiative; spend time with operations/product teams*

*Candidate B (Division President):*
*- Needs more board exposure and investor relations experience*
*- Should deepen enterprise-wide strategic thinking beyond own division*
*- Needs to build relationships across the entire organization*
*- Recommended: Present to board regularly; participate in company-wide strategic planning; lead enterprise initiative*

b) *18-month development and selection plan:*
*1. Create equal development opportunities for both - assign each a major cross-functional initiative*
*2. Provide both candidates increased board exposure - regular presentations and committee interactions*
*3. Establish clear evaluation criteria and timeline - what the board will assess at 6, 12, and 15 months*
*4. Use executive assessments and 360 feedback at multiple points*
*5. Plan for the non-selected candidate - retention strategy and role discussions regardless of outcome*
*6. Make decision at 12-15 months to allow 3-6 month transition period with outgoing CEO*
*7. Keep both candidates informed about the process to maintain engagement*

### Section 6: Employee Engagement

**27.** C) 70%
*Gallup's research consistently shows managers account for 70% of the variance in team engagement scores.*

**28.** B) Likelihood employees would recommend the company as a place to work
*eNPS asks "How likely are you to recommend this company as a place to work?" on a 0-10 scale.*

**29.** B) What keeps you working here?
*Stay interviews are proactive conversations with current employees to understand retention drivers, not exit conversations.*

**30.** B) Departures of employees the organization wanted to keep
*Regrettable turnover = voluntary departures of high performers or critical talent the organization wanted to retain.*

**31.** (10 points) Sample Answer:

a) *Analysis of decline causes:*
*The overall decline (65% from 72%) likely stems from the 15% restructuring. Evidence:*
*- Manager relationship and career development dropped most significantly*
*- Restructuring creates uncertainty about the future and career paths*
*- Remaining employees may have survivor guilt or fear additional cuts*
*- Manager relationships suffered possibly due to managers having difficult conversations or being unavailable during transition*
*- Work-life balance improved possibly because workload redistributed or fewer meetings*

b) *Top two priority focus areas:*
*1. Career Development (52%, biggest gap to benchmark): Employees who survived restructuring need to see a future at the company. Addressing this directly combats "why should I stay?" concerns.*
*2. Manager Relationship (58%, significant drop): Managers are the primary lever for engagement. If manager relationships are suffering, all other dimensions will be harder to improve.*
*These two are interrelated - managers need to have career conversations to address both.*

c) *Manager actions for career development:*
*1. Schedule career conversations: Every manager should have a dedicated career conversation with each team member within 30 days. Use a structured guide covering aspirations, development interests, and growth opportunities.*
*2. Create visible development opportunities: Work with HR to publish available stretch assignments, project opportunities, and internal mobility options. Managers should actively connect team members to relevant opportunities.*
*3. Address restructuring impact: Explicitly discuss how the restructuring affects career paths. Be honest about what has changed while highlighting new opportunities created.*
*4. Individual development plans: Create/update development plans for each team member with specific actions, not just future promotions but skill-building in current role.*
*5. Short-term wins: Identify quick development wins (training, mentoring, project involvement) to demonstrate investment in employees' growth.*
