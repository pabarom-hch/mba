## Introduction

Commercial Due Diligence (CDD) answers the strategic question: "Is this a good business in a good market?" While QoE validates the numbers, CDD validates the business model and growth potential.

CDD combines top-down market analysis with bottom-up customer insights to assess whether the investment thesis holds.

### Market Analysis

#### Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)

```
MARKET SIZING FRAMEWORK
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TAM (Total Addressable Market)
│   All potential customers globally
│   Example: Global IT services = $1.2T
│
├── SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
│   │   Customers you could realistically reach
│   │   Example: US mid-market IT services = $50B
│   │
│   └── SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
│       Realistic near-term capture
│       Example: Southeast US mid-market = $5B
│       Current share: 1% = $50M revenue
```

#### Growth Analysis

| Growth Driver | Analysis Approach |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Market growth** | Industry reports, GDP correlation |
| **Share gains** | Historical trends, competitive wins |
| **Price increases** | Pricing power, inflation pass-through |
| **New products** | Pipeline, success rate |
| **Geographic expansion** | Whitespace analysis |

#### Trend Assessment

| Trend Type | Examples | Impact |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **Secular tailwinds** | Digitization, aging population | Long-term positive |
| **Cyclical factors** | Economic cycle, construction | Timing risk |
| **Disruptive threats** | Technology change, new entrants | Business model risk |
| **Regulatory changes** | New requirements, compliance | Cost/opportunity |

---

### Competitive Position

#### Market Share Analysis

| Position | Market Share | Implications |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Leader** | >25% | Pricing power, economies of scale |
| **Strong #2-3** | 10-25% | Viable, may need differentiation |
| **Fragmented** | <10% | Consolidation opportunity |
| **Declining** | Losing share | Red flag, requires explanation |

#### Competitive Moat Assessment

```
COMPETITIVE MOAT FRAMEWORK
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MOAT TYPE              STRENGTH        DURABILITY
──────────             ────────        ──────────

Brand/Reputation       Medium          Can erode over time
│
Switching Costs        High            Strong if embedded
│
Network Effects        Very High       Winner-take-most
│
Cost Advantages        Medium          Can be replicated
│
Regulatory Barriers    High            But may change
│
Scale                  Medium-High     Sustainable advantage
│
Patents/IP             Time-limited    Expiration risk
```

#### Competitive Dynamics

Key questions:
- How do competitors compete? (price, quality, service)
- Who is gaining/losing share? Why?
- What would a new entrant need to succeed?
- How would competitors respond to change?

### Customer Analysis

#### Concentration Risk

| Metric | Green | Yellow | Red |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| Top customer % | <10% | 10-20% | >20% |
| Top 5 customers % | <25% | 25-40% | >40% |
| Top 10 customers % | <40% | 40-60% | >60% |

#### Customer Quality Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Contract type** | Long-term, recurring vs. project-based |
| **Contract terms** | Auto-renewal, pricing escalators |
| **Customer tenure** | Average relationship length |
| **Customer growth** | Growing, stable, or declining |
| **Customer health** | Financial stability, industry outlook |

#### Customer Interviews

CDD typically includes 15-30 customer calls:

**Key Questions:**
1. Why do you work with this company?
2. What do they do well? What could improve?
3. Who else did you consider? Why choose them?
4. How likely to continue working with them?
5. What would make you leave?
6. How does pricing compare to alternatives?

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Market Sizing
A company has $25M revenue in a fragmented regional market. Build a TAM/SAM/SOM framework and estimate market share.

### Problem 2: Concentration Analysis
Top 3 customers represent 35% of revenue (15%, 12%, 8%). The #1 customer just renewed for 3 years. How would you assess and mitigate this risk?

### Problem 3: Competitive Threat
A large national competitor announces entry into your target's market. What questions would you ask in CDD to assess the threat?
