## Answer Key

### Section 1
1-B, 2-B, 3-B, 4-B, 5-A, 6-B, 7-C, 8-C, 9-B, 10-B, 11-B, 12-B, 13-C, 14-B, 15-B

### Section 2
- Owner add-backs: $350K + $120K + $48K = $518K
- Rent adjustment: -$75K (normalize to market)
- Legal: +$200K (if truly one-time)
- Adjusted EBITDA: $8.0M + $518K + $200K - $75K = **$8.64M**
- Pro Forma: $8.64M + $80K - $150K = **$8.57M**
- Offer: $8.57M × 7.5x = **$64.3M** (vs. $60M on reported)

### Section 3
- Exit EV: $20M × 9.0x = **$180M**
- Exit Equity: $180M - $30M = **$150M**
- MOIC: $150M / $36M = **4.2x**
- IRR: ~**33%** (interpolate between 4.0x and 4.5x)
