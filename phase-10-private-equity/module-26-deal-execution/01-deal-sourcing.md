## Introduction

Deal sourcing is the lifeblood of private equity. Without quality deal flow, even the best investment team cannot generate returns. The most successful PE firms don't just wait for deals to come to them—they proactively source and cultivate proprietary opportunities.

This lesson covers both the art and science of PE deal origination.

### Building Investment Theses

A thesis is a pre-conceived view of an attractive investment:

```

───────────                      ─────────────────
Why this industry?               Why now?
• Tailwinds                      • Founder transition
• Fragmentation                  • Corporate carve-out
• Margin opportunity             • Distressed situation
• Tech enablement                • Growth capital need

             ▼
    COMPANY CRITERIA

## Framework: The Sourcing Process

### Step 1: Universe Building

```
UNIVERSE BUILDING PROCESS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Data Sources:

├── Trade associations
├── Conference attendee lists
├── LinkedIn/ZoomInfo
└── Proprietary research

Filter Criteria:
├── Revenue range

├── EBITDA proxy (employee count)
├── Ownership type

└── Target list of 200-500 companies
```

### Step 2: Prioritization

| Follow-up 2 | Day 12 | Email |
| Follow-up 3 | Day 25 | Email/Phone |
| Nurture | Monthly | Newsletter/content |

**Effective Outreach Email:**

```

| **Give feedback** | Even on passed deals |
| **Close deals** | Track record matters |
| **Maintain reputation** | Word travels |

**Evaluating Bankers:**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Deal quality** | Right size, sector, quality |
| **Process management** | Professional, organized |
| **Information access** | Quality of materials |
| **Relationship with seller** | Trust and influence |
