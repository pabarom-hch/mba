# Lesson 4: Operational Due Diligence

> Assessing management, processes, technology, and scalability

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Evaluate management team capability and gaps
- Assess operational processes and efficiency
- Identify technology risks and opportunities
- Evaluate organizational scalability
- Develop operational value creation hypotheses

---

## Introduction

Operational Due Diligence (ODD) answers: "Can we improve this business?" While financial and commercial DD look backward and outward, ODD looks forward and inward—assessing the people, processes, and systems that will drive value creation.

PE firms increasingly win deals not by paying more, but by demonstrating credible operational value creation plans. ODD is where those plans take shape.

```
FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT MATRIX
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Function          Current      Adequate?     Action
─────────         ───────      ─────────     ──────
CEO               Strong       Yes           Retain, incent

### Technology Assessment

#### Systems Landscape

```
IT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SYSTEM              STATUS          RISK/OPPORTUNITY
──────              ──────          ────────────────
ERP                 Legacy on-prem  Needs upgrade ($500K)
CRM                 Salesforce      Good, underutilized
HRIS                Manual/Excel    Implement system ($50K)
Financial reporting QuickBooks      Adequate for now
Cybersecurity       Minimal         High risk, invest
Website/Digital     Outdated        Refresh needed
Data/Analytics      Limited         Opportunity

Total IT Investment Needed: $800K-$1.2M over 3 years
```

#### Technical Debt

| Category | Examples | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Infrastructure** | Old servers, no cloud | Reliability, cost |
| **Applications** | Unsupported software | Security, maintenance |
| **Integrations** | Manual data transfer | Efficiency, errors |
| **Documentation** | No documentation | Key person risk |

#### Cybersecurity

| Assessment Area | Questions |
|-----------------|-----------|
| **Perimeter** | Firewall, intrusion detection? |
| **Access** | MFA, password policies? |
| **Data** | Encryption, backup, recovery? |
| **Training** | Employee awareness? Phishing tests? |
| **Compliance** | SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI if applicable? |

---

### Scalability Assessment

#### Capacity Analysis

| Dimension | Current | At 2x Revenue | Gap |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-----|
| **Production** | 70% utilized | 140% needed | Expansion required |
| **Sales** | 5 reps, $3M each | 10 reps needed | Hiring plan |
| **Management** | Lean | Needs depth | Add layer |
| **Systems** | Adequate | Straining | Upgrade |
| **Capital** | Self-funded | Capex needed | $2M investment |

#### Organizational Readiness

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Structure** | Flat vs. hierarchical, spans of control |
| **Processes** | Documented, scalable, or ad hoc? |
| **Culture** | Entrepreneurial vs. professional |
| **Talent** | Bench strength, development programs |

---

## Worked Example: ODD Summary

**Target:** ServicePro Manufacturing

### Management Assessment

| Role | Individual | Rating | Action |
|------|------------|--------|--------|
| CEO | John Smith | Strong | Retain, rollover |
| CFO | — | Gap | Hire within 60 days |
| VP Ops | Sarah Jones | Adequate | Develop |
| VP Sales | Mike Brown | Weak | Assess, likely replace |
| Controller | Jane Wilson | Strong | Promote potential |

**Key Finding:** Strong CEO, but needs CFO and sales leadership upgrade.

### Process Assessment

| Area | Current State | Opportunity |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Sales | Ad hoc, no CRM | Implement process, +20% productivity |
| Operations | Lean, efficient | Limited improvement |
| Finance | Monthly close 20 days | Accelerate to 10 days |
| Procurement | Fragmented | Consolidate, save 5-8% |

### Technology Assessment

| Priority | Investment | Payback |
|----------|------------|---------|
| ERP upgrade | $400K | Process efficiency |
| CRM implementation | $100K | Sales productivity |
| Cybersecurity | $150K | Risk mitigation |
| **Total** | **$650K** | |

### Scalability Assessment

**Finding:** Company can grow to 1.5x revenue with current infrastructure; beyond that requires:
- Plant expansion ($2M)
- Management layer (3 hires)
- Systems investment ($650K)

### ODD Conclusion

**Value creation opportunities identified:**
1. Management upgrade (CFO, sales) — Critical
2. Sales process improvement — $2M revenue potential
3. Procurement savings — $400K EBITDA
4. Technology investment — Enabler for scale

**Risk:** CEO key person risk requires retention package

## PE Application

### ODD Team Composition

| Team Member | Focus |
|-------------|-------|
| **Operating Partner** | Management, strategy, governance |
| **Functional expert** | Sales, operations, or technology |
| **Deal team** | Integration with financial model |
| **External consultants** | Specialized areas (IT, HR) |

### 100-Day Plan Development

ODD feeds directly into the 100-day plan:

```
100-DAY PLAN FRAMEWORK
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DAYS 1-30: STABILIZE & ASSESS
• Confirm management status
• Address critical issues
• Establish governance
• Deep-dive operations

DAYS 31-60: PLAN & INITIATE
• Finalize value creation plan
• Begin key hires
• Launch quick wins
• Set up reporting cadence

DAYS 61-100: EXECUTE
• Implement initiatives
• Track progress
• Adjust as needed
• Communicate results
```

---

## CEO Application

### Preparing for ODD

**Management presentation should address:**
1. Your background and track record
2. Team strengths and development plans
3. Known gaps and how you'd fill them
4. Operational improvement opportunities you see
5. Technology roadmap

**Site visit preparation:**
1. Clean facilities
2. Brief key employees
3. Prepare operational data
4. Plan logical tour flow
5. Have answers ready for common questions

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **ODD assesses** people, processes, technology, and scalability
2. **Management is paramount** — PE can't execute without the right team
3. **Process gaps** are value creation opportunities
4. **Technology** can be both risk and opportunity
5. **Scalability assessment** informs growth planning
6. **ODD feeds** directly into 100-day plan development

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Management Assessment
A company has a strong founder-CEO who wants to retire in 2 years. The CFO is part-time and shared with another entity. There's no formal sales leader. How would you structure management upgrades?

### Problem 2: Technology Risk
During ODD, you discover the company runs on a 15-year-old ERP that the vendor no longer supports. How do you factor this into your model and deal terms?

### Problem 3: Scalability Analysis
A company has $20M revenue at 95% facility utilization. The value creation plan calls for doubling revenue in 5 years. What operational changes are needed?
