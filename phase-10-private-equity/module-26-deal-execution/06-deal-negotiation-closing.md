### LOI Negotiation

Key LOI terms to negotiate:

| Term | Buyer Preference | Seller Preference |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Price** | Range or "up to" | Firm number |
| **Structure** | Flexibility | Cash certainty |
| **Exclusivity** | 60-90 days | 30-45 days |
| **DD scope** | Broad access | Limited, staged |
| **Break fee** | None | Yes, if exclusive |
| **Conditions** | Many outs | Few conditions |

**LOI Negotiation Strategy:**

```
LOI NEGOTIATION FRAMEWORK
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. ANCHOR APPROPRIATELY
   • Set reasonable expectations
   • Leave room to move on non-price terms
   • Don't negotiate against yourself

2. PRIORITIZE ISSUES
   • Must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
   • Which terms have real value?
   • Where can you concede?

3. TRADE STRATEGICALLY
   • "I can do X if you can do Y"
   • Create package deals
   • Save trades for key moments

4. MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIP
   • You'll work together post-close
   • Don't poison the well
   • Win-win is sustainable
```

### SPA Negotiation

The Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) covers:

| Section | Key Issues |
|---------|------------|
| **Purchase Price** | Amount, structure, adjustments |
| **Reps & Warranties** | Scope, survival, caps |
| **Indemnification** | Basket, cap, escrow |
| **Covenants** | Pre-close operations |
| **Conditions** | What must happen to close |
| **Termination** | When parties can walk |

#### Purchase Price Mechanics

```
PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT TIMELINE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SIGNING               CLOSE                POST-CLOSE
───────               ─────                ──────────

Estimated        →    Estimated       →    Final
Balance Sheet         Adjustment           True-up
                      (preliminary)         (90 days)

Components adjusted:
• Net debt (vs. target)
• Working capital (vs. target)
• Transaction expenses
• Other agreed items
```

#### Representation Negotiation

```
REP NEGOTIATION FRAMEWORK
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SELLER WANTS:           BUYER WANTS:
──────────────          ────────────
Knowledge qualifiers    No qualifiers
Materiality thresholds  Dollar thresholds
Narrow scope            Broad scope
Short survival          Long survival
Low cap                 High cap
Small escrow            Large escrow
```

**Common Compromise:**
- Knowledge qualifier on some reps, not others
- Dollar thresholds (e.g., "in excess of $50,000")
- Fundamental reps uncapped; others capped at 15-20%
- Escrow of 10-15%, released after 12-18 months

---

### Closing Conditions

Standard closing conditions:

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Accuracy of reps** | Reps true at signing and closing |
| **Covenant compliance** | Pre-close covenants satisfied |
| **No MAE** | No material adverse effect |
| **Third-party consents** | Customer, landlord, etc. |
| **Regulatory approval** | HSR, industry-specific |
| **Financing** | Debt commitment fulfilled |
| **Deliverables** | Certificates, opinions, etc. |

**Material Adverse Effect (MAE):**

```
MAE CLAUSE NEGOTIATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TYPICAL MAE DEFINITION:
"Any event or circumstance that has, or would reasonably
be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition, or results of operations
of the Company..."

TYPICAL CARVE-OUTS (not considered MAE):
• General economic conditions
• Industry-wide changes
• Changes in law or GAAP
• Acts of war or terrorism
• Failure to meet projections (alone)
• Announcement of the transaction

NEGOTIATION: Sellers want broad carve-outs; buyers want narrow
```

### Pre-Close Management

Between signing and closing:

| Obligation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Ordinary course** | No major changes without consent |
| **No-shop** | Can't solicit other buyers |
| **Access** | Continued DD and transition planning |
| **Cooperation** | Assist with financing, consents |
| **Communication** | Update on material developments |

**Deal Risk During Pre-Close:**
- Customer loss
- Key employee departure
- Covenant breach
- Financing market disruption
- Regulatory challenge

---

## Framework: Negotiation Tactics

### Effective Tactics

| Tactic | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Anchoring** | Set the starting point favorably |
| **Bracketing** | Start far, expect to meet in middle |
| **Good cop/bad cop** | One person tough, one reasonable |
| **Deadline pressure** | Use timeline to drive decisions |
| **Create competition** | Multiple options create leverage |
| **Package deals** | Trade across multiple issues |

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Negotiating every point | Delays close, damages relationship |
| Winning on unimportant issues | Burns goodwill |
| Making ultimatums | Can backfire |
| Ignoring the other side's constraints | Deals fall apart |
| Not knowing your BATNA | Give up too much |

## PE Application

### Closing Mechanics

**Day of Close:**

```
CLOSING DAY TIMELINE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

8:00 AM   Final document review
9:00 AM   Signatures begin (electronic)
10:00 AM  Funds wired (escrow agent confirms)
11:00 AM  Releases executed
12:00 PM  Transaction closed
1:00 PM   Closing dinner
```

**Post-Close:**
- Announce transaction (if agreed)
- Begin 100-day plan
- File necessary documents
- Set up new governance
- Address Day 1 priorities

### Deal Certainty Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **R&W insurance** | Reduce escrow, cleaner seller exit |
| **Reverse break fee** | Commit buyer to close |
| **Marketing period** | Allow debt syndication |
| **Interim financing** | Bridge to permanent debt |
| **Specific performance** | Force close if buyer backs out |

## CEO Application

### Your Role in Closing

**Pre-Close:**
1. Maintain business performance
2. Preserve relationships
3. Support transition planning
4. Manage information flow
5. Prepare team for change

**At Close:**
1. Execute documents
2. Communicate with employees
3. Align with new owners
4. Launch 100-day plan
5. Set tone for new chapter

**Watch Out For:**
- Employee anxiety
- Customer/vendor concerns
- Deal fatigue
- Last-minute surprises

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **LOI to close** typically takes 8-12 weeks
2. **Price is important** but terms often matter more
3. **Reps and warranties** allocate risk between parties
4. **Conditions to close** protect against adverse changes
5. **Pre-close period** requires careful management
6. **Closing is coordinated** with multiple parties and documents
7. **Relationships matter** — you'll work together post-close

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: LOI Terms
A seller wants $100M with 90-day exclusivity. You're willing to pay $95M with 60-day exclusivity. How do you structure a negotiation to reach agreement?

### Problem 2: MAE Analysis
Two weeks before close, the company's largest customer (15% of revenue) gives 90-day termination notice. Is this an MAE? What are your options?

### Problem 3: Rep Negotiation
Seller wants all reps qualified by materiality and knowledge. You've discovered in DD that there may be environmental issues. How do you negotiate the environmental rep?
