# Lesson 1: Fund Strategy & Validation

> Developing a differentiated investment thesis and validating it with the LP market

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Develop and articulate a compelling investment thesis
- Select the appropriate fund structure for a given strategy
- Map the competitive landscape and position a new fund
- Validate fund strategy through LP market sounding
- Determine optimal fund size based on strategy and deployment capacity
- Assess track record requirements for different LP types

---

## Introduction

Every successful PE fund begins with a clear, differentiated investment thesis — a coherent explanation of *what* the fund will invest in, *why* those investments will generate superior returns, and *how* the GP team is uniquely qualified to execute the strategy. Without this foundation, fundraising becomes a directionless exercise.

This lesson covers the strategic decisions that precede fund formation: developing the thesis, choosing the vehicle structure, sizing the fund, and — critically — validating the strategy with prospective LPs before committing the time and capital required for a full launch. As covered in Module 25 Lesson 1, PE funds operate within a 10-year lifecycle. The strategic choices made before Day 1 constrain everything that follows.

The difference between a successful fund launch and a failed one often comes down to the quality of pre-launch strategy work. Emerging managers who skip validation and rush to legal formation frequently discover — after spending $200K-$500K on legal fees — that their strategy doesn't resonate with allocators.

## Core Concepts

### What is an Investment Thesis?

An investment thesis is a structured argument for why a specific investment strategy will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. It answers five fundamental questions:

| Question | What It Addresses | Example |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **What?** | Target investments | Lower mid-market B2B software companies |
| **Why?** | Market opportunity | Fragmented market with 50,000+ targets, aging founders |
| **How?** | Value creation plan | Professionalize sales, implement recurring revenue, bolt-on M&A |
| **Who?** | Team differentiation | Team of 3 former B2B SaaS operators + PE deal experience |
| **Returns?** | Target economics | 3.0x gross MOIC, 25%+ net IRR over 5-year holds |

**Strong Thesis Characteristics:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    STRONG INVESTMENT THESIS                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│  ✓ Specific — clearly defined target market and deal type    │
│  ✓ Differentiated — explains why THIS team wins deals        │
│  ✓ Repeatable — not dependent on a single opportunity        │
│  ✓ Scalable — enough targets to deploy the fund              │
│  ✓ Defensible — competitive advantages vs. other GPs         │
│  ✓ Validated — tested with allocators and industry experts   │
│                                                              │
│  ✗ Generic — "we buy good companies at fair prices"          │
│  ✗ Undifferentiated — no reason THIS team vs. 100 others     │
│  ✗ Narrow — only 5 potential targets in the universe         │
│  ✗ Unproven — team has no relevant experience                │
│                                                              │

### Fund Type Selection

The choice of fund structure determines how capital is raised, deployed, and returned. Key decisions include:

#### Blind Pool vs. Deal-by-Deal

| Dimension | Blind Pool Fund | Deal-by-Deal (Syndication) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Capital commitment** | LPs commit upfront for future deals | LPs decide on each deal individually |
| **GP control** | Full discretion within strategy mandate | Must "sell" each deal to investors |
| **Fee structure** | Management fee on committed capital | Transaction fees per deal |
| **LP base** | Institutional investors, HNW | Often HNW, family offices |
| **Minimum fund size** | Typically $50M+ for institutional | Can start with $1M+ |
| **Fundraising effort** | One large raise | Continuous, deal-by-deal |
| **Best for** | Experienced GPs with track record | Emerging managers building track record |
| **Regulatory complexity** | Higher | Lower |

#### Open-End vs. Closed-End

| Feature | Closed-End | Open-End (Evergreen) |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| **Fund life** | Fixed term (10 years + extensions) | Perpetual |
| **Subscriptions** | During fundraising period only | Ongoing |
| **Redemptions** | No redemptions; exit via distributions | Periodic redemption windows |
| **NAV calculation** | Quarterly estimates | Regular NAV required |
| **Typical strategy** | Buyout, growth equity | Real estate, credit, secondaries |
| **Liquidity** | Illiquid | Semi-liquid |

#### Vehicle Structure Options

```

**Delaware LP** remains the dominant structure for US-based PE funds:
- Pass-through tax treatment (no entity-level tax)
- Well-developed legal precedent
- GP/LP liability protection
- Flexible governance via LPA

### Target Market Analysis

Before launching, GPs must understand their competitive landscape:

#### Mapping the LP Landscape

| LP Type | Typical Min. Fund Size | Track Record Expectation | Decision Timeline | Allocation to Emerging Managers |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Large Pensions** (CalPERS, OTPP) | $500M+ | 2+ prior funds | 6-12 months | 0-5% of PE allocation |
| **Endowments** (Yale, Harvard) | $200M+ | 1-2 prior funds | 3-6 months | 5-15% |
| **Foundations** | $100M+ | Some track record | 3-6 months | 5-20% |
| **Fund of Funds** | $50M+ | Attributable track record | 2-4 months | 20-40% |
| **Family Offices** | No minimum | Relationship-based | 1-3 months | Varies widely |
| **HNW Individuals** | No minimum | Trust-based | 1-2 months | N/A |

#### Competitive Positioning

Understanding where your fund fits in the market:

| Positioning Dimension | Range | Your Fund's Position |
|----------------------|-------|---------------------|
| **Fund Size** | $25M → $10B+ | Where on the spectrum? |
| **Strategy** | Buyout → Growth → VC → Credit | Which strategy niche? |
| **Sector Focus** | Generalist → Specialist | How narrow? |
| **Geography** | Global → Regional → Single-market | Where do you invest? |
| **Deal Size** | $5M → $1B+ | What's your sweet spot? |
| **Control** | Control → Significant minority → Minority | What position do you take? |

### Strategy Validation

**Market sounding** is the process of testing your fund concept with prospective LPs before committing to a full launch. This is arguably the most important pre-launch activity.

#### Validation Process

```
PHASE 1 (Months 1-2)         PHASE 2 (Months 2-3)         PHASE 3 (Month 3-4)
─────────────────────         ─────────────────────         ────────────────────
Informal Conversations        Structured Feedback           Go/No-Go Decision

• 15-20 LP conversations      • Refined pitch deck          • Synthesize feedback
• Test thesis verbally         • 10-15 formal meetings       • Adjust strategy
• Gauge interest level         • Specific questions on       • Set target fund size
• Identify objections            terms, size, team           • Finalize terms
• Understand LP needs          • Soft-circle interest        • Proceed to formation
                                                               (or pivot/abort)
```

#### What to Listen For

| LP Feedback | Signal | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| "This is interesting, keep us posted" | Polite pass | Dig deeper on objections |
| "We'd want to see X before committing" | Conditional interest | Address the gap |
| "What's your target size? We'd consider $X" | Real interest with sizing signal | Note allocation size |
| "We don't invest in first-time funds" | Hard constraint | Move to other LP types |
| "We'd want an anchor position" | Strong interest + influence desire | Evaluate anchor terms |

### Fund Size Determination

Fund size is not arbitrary — it flows from strategy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  FUND SIZE CALCULATION                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│  Target Deal Size × Number of Deals = Deployment Capital     │
│  Deployment Capital + Reserves + Fees = Total Fund Size      │
│                                                              │
│  Example:                                                    │
│  $20M avg deal × 12 deals = $240M deployment                │
│  $240M + $50M reserves + $10M fees = $300M fund             │
│                                                              │
│  Constraints:                                                │
│  • Max 10-20% of fund per deal (concentration limits)        │
│  • 30-50% reserves for follow-ons and fees                   │
│  • Fund size must support management fee economics           │
│  • Must be deployable within investment period (3-5 years)   │
│                                                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Fund Size Sweet Spots by Strategy:**

| Strategy | Typical Fund I Size | Deal Count | Avg Deal Size |
|----------|-------------------|------------|---------------|
| Lower mid-market buyout | $100M-$300M | 8-15 | $10M-$30M equity |
| Mid-market buyout | $300M-$1B | 8-12 | $30M-$100M equity |
| Growth equity | $100M-$500M | 15-25 | $10M-$30M |
| Venture capital | $50M-$250M | 20-40 | $2M-$10M |
| Real estate value-add | $100M-$500M | 10-20 | $10M-$40M equity |
| Distressed/special sits | $200M-$1B | 10-20 | $20M-$75M |

### Track Record Requirements

LPs evaluate track record to predict future performance. The challenge for emerging managers is demonstrating relevant experience:

#### Types of Track Record

| Type | Description | LP Perception |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Attributable** | Deals you personally led at a prior firm | Strongest (if documented) |
| **Team** | Combined track record of the new team | Strong if team worked together |
| **Firm** | Track record of the firm you're leaving | Moderate (attribution questions) |
| **Simulated/pro forma** | "If we had a fund, this is what we would have done" | Weak |

#### Seeding Strategies for Fund I

| Approach | Description | Typical Terms |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Anchor LP** | Large LP commits early (25-50% of fund) | Fee discount, LPAC seat, co-invest rights |
| **Seed/acceleration capital** | Specialized firm provides seed + operational support | Revenue share or GP equity stake (10-25%) |
| **Strategic LP** | Corporate or family office with aligned interests | Board observer, deal flow access |
| **GP stakes investor** | Firm invests in the GP entity itself | 10-30% GP equity for capital + support |
| **Friends & family** | Initial capital from personal network | Standard terms or modest discount |

### LP-Strategy Fit Matrix

Not all LP types are suitable for all fund strategies:

| Strategy | Pensions | Endowments | Family Offices | Fund of Funds | HNW |
|----------|----------|------------|----------------|---------------|-----|
| Large Buyout ($1B+) | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ | ★★ | ★ |
| Mid-Market Buyout | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ |
| Lower Mid-Market | ★★ | ★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ |
| Growth Equity | ★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ | ★★ |
| Venture Capital | ★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★ | ★★ |
| Real Estate PE | ★★★ | ★★ | ★★★ | ★★ | ★★★ |
| Emerging Manager Fund I | ★ | ★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ |

*(★★★ = Strong fit, ★★ = Moderate, ★ = Weak)*

## Worked Example: Designing a Fund Strategy

**Scenario:** Sarah Chen is a VP at a mid-market PE firm. She has 8 years of experience and has been the lead deal professional on 6 healthcare services transactions. She wants to launch her own fund.

**Step 1: Define the Thesis**

| Element | Sarah's Answer |
|---------|---------------|
| What? | Healthcare services businesses (revenue cycle management, home health, behavioral health) |
| Why? | Fragmented market with 10,000+ independent providers, aging demographic tailwinds, reimbursement complexity creating moats |
| How? | Platform acquisitions at 6-8x EBITDA, bolt-on M&A at 4-6x, technology-enabled revenue optimization |
| Who? | Former healthcare PE investor + operating partner from major health system |
| Returns? | 3.0x gross MOIC, 25% net IRR target |

**Step 2: Size the Fund**

```
Target deal size: $15M-$30M equity checks
Portfolio construction: 8-10 platform investments
Follow-on reserves: 40% of fund for add-ons and follow-on
Fee/expense reserve: ~5%

Calculation:
  8 platforms × $22.5M avg = $180M deployment
  Follow-on/add-on reserve  = $120M (40%)
  Fee/expense reserve        = $15M
  ─────────────────────────────────
  Target fund size           = $315M → Round to $300M
```

**Step 3: Validate**

Sarah conducts 20 LP conversations over 2 months:

| LP Type | Count | Response |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Endowments | 3 | "Interesting, but prefer Fund II+" |
| Fund of Funds | 5 | 2 expressed strong interest ($15-25M each), 3 wanted more track record |
| Family Offices | 8 | 4 expressed interest ($5-15M each), healthcare angle resonated |
| HNW (former colleagues) | 4 | 3 likely commitments ($1-3M each) |

**Result:** Soft-circled interest of ~$80-100M. Sarah adjusts target to $200M Fund I (more achievable) with plans to scale to $400M+ for Fund II.

**Step 4: Finalize Strategy**

| Decision | Fund I | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Fund size | $200M | Achievable with identified LP interest |
| GP commitment | $4M (2%) | Shows alignment; Sarah + partner contribute |
| Structure | Delaware LP | Standard, cost-effective |
| Management fee | 2.0% on committed (inv. period), 1.5% on invested (post) | Market-standard for Fund I |
| Carry | 20% over 8% preferred | Standard terms |
| Investment period | 4 years | Sufficient for 8-10 platforms |

## PE Application

### How Established PE Firms Approach Fund Strategy

Established firms face different strategy questions when raising successor funds:

**Strategy Evolution Decisions:**
- Maintain current strategy vs. expand (new sectors, geographies)
- Fund size growth rate (1.5-2.5x typical step-up per fund)
- Team expansion to support larger fund
- Sector fund spin-outs vs. main fund diversification

**Competitive Positioning for Established GPs:**

| Firm Stage | Key Challenge | Strategy Focus |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Fund I-II | Proving the model | Niche focus, concentrated bets |
| Fund III-IV | Scaling the platform | Adding sectors, growing team |
| Fund V+ | Maintaining returns at scale | Avoiding strategy drift, succession |

---

## CEO Application

If you're a CEO interacting with PE fund formation:

1. **As a potential portfolio company CEO** — Understand whether a GP's fund is new (Fund I) or established. Fund I GPs may be more hands-on and motivated but may have fewer resources.

2. **As an executive considering a GP role** — Evaluate the fund's strategy and your alignment. Key questions:
   - Is the fund sized to support your compensation expectations?
   - Does the investment thesis match your expertise?
   - What's the GP commitment requirement? Can you fund it?
   - Who are the anchor LPs and what influence do they have?

3. **As an LP evaluating managers** — Apply the frameworks in this lesson to assess whether a GP's strategy is well-conceived, differentiated, and executable.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Strategy too broad | "We invest in good companies" — no differentiation | Define specific sector, size, geography niche |
| Strategy too narrow | Only 10 potential targets in the universe | Ensure 100+ potential targets for pipeline |
| Skipping validation | Launch fund, then discover no LP interest | Test with 15-20 LPs before legal formation |
| Oversizing Fund I | Targeting $500M with no track record | Size to what you can raise ($100-200M typical Fund I) |
| Ignoring GP economics | Fund too small to sustain operations | Model management fee revenue vs. operating costs |
| Copying other GPs | "We'll do what Thoma Bravo does" — at 1/100th the scale | Develop authentic, differentiated edge |
| Underestimating timeline | "We'll close in 6 months" | Plan for 12-18 months for Fund I |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **A strong investment thesis** answers what, why, how, who, and returns — and is specific enough to differentiate from competitors
2. **Fund structure selection** (blind pool vs. syndication, LP vs. LLC) depends on strategy, LP base, and complexity needs
3. **Fund size is not arbitrary** — it flows from deal size × deal count + reserves
4. **Validation before formation** saves $200K-$500K in legal fees and 12+ months of misdirected effort
5. **Track record is the #1 challenge** for emerging managers; seeding arrangements and anchor LPs can bridge the gap
6. **LP-Strategy Fit** varies significantly — family offices and fund of funds are more accessible for Fund I than large pensions
7. **The Fund Strategy Canvas** provides a structured framework for articulating and pressure-testing your thesis

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Fund Sizing

A GP team wants to launch a lower mid-market buyout fund targeting manufacturing companies. They plan to make 10-12 platform investments with average equity checks of $15M. They want 35% reserves for add-on acquisitions and 5% for fees/expenses.

a) Calculate the target fund size.
b) What would the management fee revenue be in Year 1 at 2.0% on committed capital?
c) If the GP team has 4 professionals and annual operating costs of $3M, is the fund large enough to sustain operations on management fees alone?

### Problem 2: Strategy Differentiation

Two GPs are both raising lower mid-market healthcare funds. Compare their strategies and identify which is better positioned:

**GP A:** "We invest in healthcare services companies with $5-20M EBITDA. Our team has 25 years of combined PE experience across healthcare and other sectors."

**GP B:** "We acquire revenue cycle management companies with $3-10M EBITDA in the Southeast US. Our founding partner built and sold a $200M RCM platform, and our operating partner was CFO of a Top 10 health system."

### Problem 3: Validation Analysis

A GP conducted 25 LP conversations during market sounding and received the following responses:
- 5 LPs said "very interested, pending final IC approval" ($10-25M each)
- 8 LPs said "interesting, keep us updated" ($5-15M each)
- 7 LPs said "not investing in Fund I managers"
- 5 LPs said "strategy doesn't match our mandate"

a) Estimate the realistic fundraising range (assume 50% conversion on "very interested" and 10% on "keep us updated").
b) What adjustments would you recommend based on the feedback pattern?

### Problem 4: GP Economics

A 3-person GP team is evaluating two fund size scenarios:

| Scenario | Fund Size | Mgmt Fee | Carry | GP Commitment |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|---------------|
| A | $150M | 2.0% | 20% | 2% ($3M) |
| B | $75M | 2.0% | 20% | 2% ($1.5M) |

Annual operating costs are $2M. Calculate for each:
a) Annual management fee revenue during investment period
b) Net fee income after operating costs
c) Carry income assuming 2.5x gross MOIC on deployed capital (assume 70% deployment rate)
d) Which scenario would you recommend and why?
