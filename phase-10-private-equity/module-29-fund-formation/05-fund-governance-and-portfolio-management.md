# Lesson 5: Fund Governance & Portfolio Management

> Managing conflicts, constructing portfolios, and governing fund operations as a fiduciary

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe the role and operation of the LP Advisory Committee (LPAC)
- Design a portfolio construction framework with appropriate concentration limits
- Identify and manage conflicts of interest across fund operations
- Implement a portfolio monitoring framework with early warning indicators
- Explain fund valuation policies and fair value determination
- Outline compliance program requirements for ongoing fund management

---

## Introduction

Once a fund is launched and capital begins deploying, the GP transitions from fundraiser to fiduciary. The governance structures established in the LPA — particularly the LP Advisory Committee — become active. Portfolio construction decisions determine risk-return outcomes. Conflicts of interest, inevitable in managing other people's money, must be identified, disclosed, and managed.

This lesson covers the ongoing management obligations that distinguish a well-run fund from a poorly governed one. While Module 27 focuses on operational improvement within portfolio companies, this lesson focuses on governance and management at the **fund level** — how the GP manages the portfolio as a whole, balances competing interests, and maintains compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

Fund governance failures — from inadequate conflict management to poor valuation practices — are among the most common reasons LPs decline to re-invest in successor funds. Establishing strong governance from Day 1 is not just a regulatory requirement; it's a competitive advantage.

## Core Concepts

### The LP Advisory Committee (LPAC)

#### Formation and Composition

| Aspect | Standard Practice |
|--------|------------------|
| **Size** | 3-7 members (odd numbers preferred for voting) |
| **Selection** | Largest LPs by commitment; some GPs invite diverse representation |
| **Term** | Life of the fund |
| **Compensation** | None (service obligation per LPA) |
| **Meeting frequency** | Semi-annually (minimum); quarterly for active funds |
| **Quorum** | Majority of members |

#### LPAC Responsibilities

### Portfolio Construction

Portfolio construction determines how the fund's capital is allocated across investments. Poor construction amplifies concentration risk; over-diversification dilutes returns.

#### Concentration Framework

| Parameter | Conservative | Standard | Concentrated |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Max per deal** | 10% of fund | 15% of fund | 20-25% of fund |
| **Target deal count** | 15-20 | 10-15 | 6-10 |
| **Sector max** | 25% | 33% | 50% |
| **Geography max** | 50% | 75% | No limit |
| **Follow-on reserve** | 40-50% | 30-40% | 20-30% |

### Deal Allocation

When a GP manages multiple funds or vehicles, allocation policy determines which fund gets which deal.

#### Allocation Policy Framework

| Scenario | Standard Approach | Key Consideration |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Deal fits one fund only | Allocate to that fund | Straightforward |
| Deal fits multiple funds | Pro-rata based on remaining capital | Must be pre-established in policy |
| Fund nearing end of investment period | Allocate to newer fund | LPA restrictions on late-period investments |
| Co-investment alongside fund | Fund gets priority; co-invest fills excess | LP co-invest rights per side letters |
| Deal too large for one fund | Split across fund + co-invest vehicle | Pre-negotiated allocation methodology |
| GP personal investment | Restricted or prohibited | Compliance policy must address |

#### SEC Requirements

The SEC expects documented allocation policies that:
- Are applied consistently
- Do not systematically favor one fund over another
- Are disclosed to investors
- Are reviewed and tested annually by compliance

### Conflict of Interest Management

```

#### Conflict Management Decision Process

| Step | Action | Owner |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1. Identify | Recognize potential conflict | All team members |
| 2. Assess | Determine materiality and impact | CCO / General Counsel |
| 3. Disclose | Document and disclose to affected parties | CCO |
| 4. Mitigate | Implement safeguards (recusal, information barrier) | CCO |
| 5. Approve | Seek LPAC approval if required by LPA | GP + LPAC |
| 6. Document | Maintain written record of process and outcome | Compliance |
| 7. Monitor | Ongoing monitoring for recurrence | CCO |

### Portfolio Monitoring

#### Monitoring Framework

| Frequency | Activity | Participants |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Weekly** | Deal team check-ins, pipeline review | GP investment team |
| **Monthly** | Portfolio company financial review | GP + portfolio company CFO |
| **Quarterly** | Board meetings, full portfolio review | GP, portfolio company boards, LPAC |
| **Annually** | Strategic planning, budget review | GP, portfolio company management |

#### Key Performance Indicators by Deal Stage

| Stage | Financial KPIs | Operational KPIs |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Year 1 (Integration)** | Revenue run-rate, cost synergies | Key hire retention, integration milestones |
| **Year 2-3 (Growth)** | Revenue growth, EBITDA margin | Customer acquisition, market share |
| **Year 3-5 (Optimization)** | FCF generation, working capital | Process efficiency, technology adoption |
| **Pre-Exit** | LTM EBITDA, growth trajectory | Management depth, customer diversification |

#### Early Warning System

| Indicator | Yellow Flag | Red Flag |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Revenue growth | Below plan by 10-15% | Below plan by 20%+ or declining |
| EBITDA margin | 200bps below target | 400bps+ below target |
| Customer concentration | Top customer >25% revenue | Top customer >40% revenue |
| Management turnover | 1 C-suite departure | 2+ C-suite departures |
| Covenant compliance | Within 15% of threshold | Breach or waiver needed |
| Cash flow | Below plan, adequate reserves | Negative FCF, liquidity concern |

### Valuation Policy

PE funds must value their portfolios quarterly for LP reporting. This involves significant judgment since portfolio companies are privately held.

#### Valuation Hierarchy (ASC 820)

| Level | Input Type | Example | Reliability |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Level 1** | Quoted market prices | Public stock after IPO | Highest |
| **Level 2** | Observable inputs | Comparable public company multiples | Moderate |
| **Level 3** | Unobservable inputs | DCF with GP assumptions, recent transaction | Lowest |

Most PE portfolio company valuations are **Level 3**, requiring significant GP judgment.

#### Common Valuation Methodologies

| Method | Application | Considerations |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Comparable companies** | Apply public trading multiples to portfolio company metrics | Illiquidity discount (10-30%), size adjustment |
| **Comparable transactions** | Recent M&A transaction multiples | Availability of data, vintage relevance |
| **DCF** | Discounted cash flow with GP projections | Highly assumption-dependent |
| **Cost/recent transaction** | Entry price or most recent round | Common for early-stage; becomes stale |
| **Calibration to entry** | Adjust entry multiple for performance changes | IPEV guidelines recommend this approach |

#### Valuation Governance

| Control | Purpose | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Written valuation policy | Consistent methodology | Annual review |
| Valuation committee | Internal review and challenge | Quarterly |
| Third-party valuation agent | Independent assessment of key positions | Annual (or quarterly for large funds) |
| Auditor review | External validation | Annual |
| LPAC review | LP oversight | Semi-annual or annual |

## Frameworks & Models

### Portfolio Construction Decision Framework

```
For each potential investment, evaluate:

1. STRATEGY FIT
   └─ Does this deal match our stated investment thesis?

2. PORTFOLIO IMPACT
   └─ Concentration: Will this exceed sector/size limits?
   └─ Diversification: Does this add or duplicate exposure?
   └─ Vintage: Are we deploying on pace?

3. RESERVE ANALYSIS
   └─ After this deal, do we have adequate reserves?
   └─ What follow-on capital might this need?

4. RETURN PROFILE
   └─ Does the expected return meet our fund targets?
   └─ How does this compare to our other portfolio companies?

5. RISK ASSESSMENT
   └─ Downside protection: What's the loss scenario?
   └─ Correlation: Is this correlated with existing holdings?
```

## Worked Example: Managing a Portfolio Conflict

**Scenario:** Apex Growth Fund I owns HealthTech Corp (a health IT company). Apex is now evaluating MedData Inc, a potential new platform investment that competes with HealthTech in one product segment (patient scheduling). MedData is 3x larger than HealthTech overall.

**Conflict Analysis:**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Nature of conflict** | Portfolio company competitive overlap |
| **Materiality** | Moderate — 15% revenue overlap in patient scheduling |
| **LPA provision** | LPA permits competitive investments with LPAC approval |
| **HealthTech board position** | GP partner sits on HealthTech board (information access) |

**Resolution Process:**

1. **Identify:** Deal team flags competitive overlap during screening
2. **Assess:** Overlap limited to one product segment; overall strategies are complementary
3. **Information barrier:** Partner on HealthTech board recused from MedData diligence
4. **LPAC presentation:** GP presents analysis showing limited overlap, different market segments
5. **LPAC vote:** LPAC approves with conditions — annual competitive impact review
6. **Documentation:** Full record of conflict analysis, LPAC minutes, and conditions
7. **Ongoing monitoring:** Quarterly review of competitive dynamics between companies

### Conflict Management: HCH Add-On Acquisition

**Scenario:** SAF identifies GovTech Solutions as a potential add-on for HCH. GovTech's CEO is a former colleague of Sarah Rodriguez.

**Conflict Analysis:**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Nature of conflict | Personal relationship (prior colleague) |
| Materiality | Low — professional relationship, no financial interest |
| LPA provision | Requires LPAC notification for related-party transactions |
| Information barrier | Not required — different companies |
| Recommended action | Disclose to LPAC; no vote required |

**Resolution:**
1. Sarah discloses relationship in deal memo
2. LPAC notified at next meeting (information item)
3. Marcus leads negotiation to ensure arm's-length terms
4. Third-party valuation obtained to support price
5. Documentation maintained in compliance files

## Nexus Simulation Connection

### Try the Fund Governance & Conflict Management Simulation

Apply the concepts from this lesson in an interactive exercise:

**[Fund Governance Simulation](../../../cases/nexus/simulations/pe-fund-governance.md)**

In this 75-minute simulation, you will:
1. Structure an LPAC and conduct your first meeting
2. Design a portfolio monitoring framework for HCH
3. Navigate conflict of interest scenarios
4. Perform quarterly valuations using ASC 820 methodology
5. Respond to an early warning situation

---

## PE Application

### Governance at Scale — Multi-Fund Platforms

| Complexity Factor | Single Fund | Multi-Fund Platform |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Deal allocation | Simple — one fund | Complex policy required |
| Conflicts | Limited | Extensive (cross-fund, co-invest) |
| LPAC management | One committee | Multiple committees with different members |
| Compliance burden | Moderate | Significant (multiple Form PFs, reporting) |
| Team allocation | Dedicated | Split time across funds |
| Valuation consistency | Straightforward | Must be consistent across funds |

---

## CEO Application

For PE-backed company CEOs, fund governance affects you directly:

1. **Board composition** — Your PE sponsor's board seat comes from their fund governance rights. Understanding LPAC dynamics helps you understand what decisions require additional approval.

2. **Valuation impacts your exit** — How the GP values your company affects LP reporting and, indirectly, the GP's reputation and fundraising for future funds. Strong performance is in everyone's interest.

3. **Conflict awareness** — If your PE sponsor also owns a competitor, understanding how they manage the conflict (information barriers, separate deal teams) protects you.

4. **Monitoring expectations** — Monthly financial packages, quarterly board meetings, and annual strategic reviews are standard governance requirements.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| No formal allocation policy | SEC scrutiny, LP distrust | Document and implement before Fund II |
| LPAC treated as rubber stamp | Erodes LP trust and governance | Genuine engagement with substantive agenda |
| Ignoring small conflicts | Small conflicts become big problems | Address all conflicts through formal process |
| Overconcentration | Single deal failure devastates fund | Enforce portfolio limits from LPA |
| Stale valuations | Misleading LP reporting | Update valuations quarterly using current data |
| No portfolio-level view | Missing correlations and sector exposure | Maintain portfolio dashboard with aggregate metrics |
| Compliance as afterthought | SEC enforcement risk | Invest in CCO and annual review |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **The LPAC** is the primary governance body — it approves conflicts, reviews valuations, and consents to fund extensions
2. **Portfolio construction** requires balancing concentration for returns with diversification for risk management
3. **Deal allocation** across funds must follow a documented, consistently applied policy
4. **Conflicts of interest** are inevitable — the key is disclosure, management, and LPAC approval
5. **Portfolio monitoring** should use KPIs, early warning systems, and regular management engagement
6. **Valuations** require significant judgment for Level 3 (private) assets; independent validation strengthens credibility
7. **Compliance** is an ongoing obligation — annual reviews, regulatory filings, and proactive risk management

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: LPAC Scenario

You manage a $200M fund. Two LPs approach you with the following situation:
- LP A (your largest at $40M commitment) wants the fund to invest in their portfolio company's competitor
- LP B ($25M commitment) wants the fund to avoid any investments in the energy sector for ESG reasons

How would you handle each request through the LPAC framework? What LPA provisions are relevant?

### Problem 2: Portfolio Construction

Your $300M fund has deployed $180M across 8 investments. You have a new opportunity requiring $50M equity. After this deal:
a) What would be the concentration in the largest single investment (assuming this is your largest deal)?
b) Does this violate a 15% single-investment limit?
c) How much reserve remains for follow-ons and fees?
d) Should you proceed? What factors would you consider?

### Problem 3: Conflict Management

Your Fund II is evaluating a deal to acquire a company that is a major supplier to one of Fund I's portfolio companies. Identify all potential conflicts and design a resolution process.

### Problem 4: Valuation Challenge

You own a software company acquired at 10x LTM EBITDA two years ago. Since acquisition:
- Revenue grew 40% but EBITDA margin declined from 25% to 18% (due to growth investment)
- Comparable public companies now trade at 15x EV/EBITDA (up from 12x at entry)
- A competitor just sold at 13x EBITDA

What valuation would you assign? Show your methodology and justify your approach.

Fund governance principles apply directly to Nexus case studies:
- Board governance and monitoring frameworks from Case 7 (PE Turnaround)
- Valuation methodology used in PE LBO Model Simulation
- Conflict management relevant to multi-stakeholder scenarios
- Portfolio-level decision making in all PE-oriented cases

See Module 22 (Corporate Governance) for governance principles that apply at the fund level.
