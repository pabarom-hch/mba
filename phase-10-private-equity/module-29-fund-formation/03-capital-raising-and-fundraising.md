# Lesson 3: Capital Raising & Fundraising

> Building an LP pipeline, executing a fundraising process, and negotiating terms

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Segment the LP universe and identify target investors by type
- Design a fundraising process with appropriate timeline and milestones
- Prepare institutional-quality pitch materials (deck, DDQ, track record)
- Understand the LP due diligence process and what allocators evaluate
- Negotiate fund terms with institutional LPs
- Manage a fundraising pipeline from first contact to commitment

---

## Introduction

Capital raising is the single most challenging aspect of launching a fund. Even the best investment strategy fails if the GP cannot attract sufficient capital. For emerging managers, fundraising for Fund I typically takes 12-18 months and involves hundreds of LP conversations to secure 20-40 commitments.

This lesson covers the end-to-end fundraising process — from mapping the LP universe to closing capital commitments. The skills required are fundamentally different from deal execution: fundraising is a sales process where the GP is the product, the fund is the offering, and LPs are sophisticated buyers with extensive experience evaluating managers.

Understanding the LP perspective is critical. Institutional LPs evaluate hundreds of funds per year and commit to a small fraction. They follow structured evaluation processes, often taking 3-6 months from first meeting to commitment. GPs who understand this process — and who prepare accordingly — dramatically improve their chances of a successful raise.

#### Conversion Rates (Industry Benchmarks)

| Stage | Metric | Emerging Manager | Established Manager |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| LP Universe → Contacted | Coverage rate | 200-400 LPs identified | 100-200 |
| Contacted → Meeting | Response rate | 15-25% | 40-60% |
| Meeting → Second Meeting | Advancement rate | 30-50% | 50-70% |
| Second Meeting → DD | DD initiation | 20-40% | 40-60% |
| DD → Commitment | Close rate | 30-50% | 60-80% |
| **End-to-end** | **Overall conversion** | **1-3%** | **10-20%** |

**Implication:** An emerging manager targeting 25 LP commitments may need to contact 500+ LPs and take 100+ first meetings.

### Pitch Materials

#### Track Record Presentation

| Metric | What to Show | What LPs Focus On |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Gross IRR** | Deal-level returns before fees | Individual deal quality |
| **Net IRR** | After management fees and carry | What LPs actually receive |
| **Gross MOIC** | Multiple on invested capital (gross) | Absolute return magnitude |
| **Realized vs. Unrealized** | Separate performance | Realized = proven; unrealized = estimate |
| **Loss ratio** | Deals below 1.0x | Downside protection |
| **Attribution** | Your personal involvement in each deal | Was it really YOUR track record? |
| **Benchmark comparison** | vs. Cambridge Associates, Preqin | Relative performance |

### The LP Due Diligence Process

LPs evaluate managers using the **4 Ps Framework:**

#### Operational Due Diligence (ODD)

Increasingly important, especially post-Madoff. ODD evaluates:

| Area | What's Evaluated | Red Flags |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Compliance** | Policies, CCO, regulatory history | No written compliance manual |
| **Valuation** | Policy, methodology, independence | GP self-valuation without oversight |
| **Cybersecurity** | Data protection, incident response | No cybersecurity program |
| **Business Continuity** | Disaster recovery, key person backup | Single point of failure |
| **Financial Controls** | Expense allocation, fee calculation | No independent audit |
| **Conflicts** | Disclosure, management, mitigation | Undisclosed conflicts |

### Terms Negotiation

#### What's Negotiable vs. Standard

| Term | Typically Standard | Often Negotiable | Rarely Negotiable |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Carry %** | 20% | ★ (only for top-decile GPs) | |
| **Hurdle rate** | 8% | | ★ |
| **Management fee** | | ★ (discounts for size/timing) | |
| **Fee offset** | 100% | | ★ |
| **GP commitment** | | ★ (LPs push for higher) | |
| **Key person** | | ★ (who's named, trigger) | |
| **No-fault termination** | 75-80% | ★ (threshold %) | |
| **Co-investment rights** | | ★ (priority vs. pro rata) | |
| **LPAC seat** | | ★ (for large LPs) | |
| **Reporting** | | ★ (enhanced for institutional) | |

#### Common LP Negotiation Asks

| Ask | GP Response Strategy |
|-----|---------------------|
| "Reduce management fee by 25bps" | Offer fee discount for commitments above $25M or at first close |
| "We want co-investment rights" | Offer pro-rata co-invest; avoid guaranteed allocation |
| "We need an LPAC seat" | Reserve for top 3-5 LPs by commitment size |
| "We want MFN" | Standard for institutional LPs; include in side letter |
| "Can you increase GP commitment?" | If possible, increase to 3-5%; signal conviction |
| "We want quarterly detailed reporting" | Agree — institutional reporting should be standard |
| "Key person should include [additional person]" | Consider if reasonable; maintain 2-3 named persons |

### Emerging Manager Fundraising

#### Unique Challenges

| Challenge | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| No fund-level track record | Many LPs require 2+ prior funds | Present attributable deal track record |
| Small team | Key person risk, capacity concerns | Highlight advisory board, outsourced functions |
| No brand recognition | Cold outreach is less effective | Leverage personal network, placement agents |
| Institutional minimums | Many LPs require $300M+ fund size | Target FoFs, family offices, HNW |
| Operational immaturity | ODD concerns | Hire outsourced compliance, use quality admin |

#### Emerging Manager Programs

Many institutional LPs have dedicated emerging manager programs:

| Program Type | Typical Allocation | What They Look For |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Pension EM programs** | $10-50M per manager | Diverse teams, differentiated strategies |
| **Endowment seeding** | $15-50M | Exceptional talent, unique access |
| **FoF emerging manager funds** | $10-30M | Niche strategies, strong attribution |
| **Seeding platforms** | $25-100M + operational support | High-potential teams, GP equity stake |

### Placement Agents

#### When to Use One

| Situation | Use Placement Agent? | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Fund I, no LP relationships | Yes | Access to LP network is essential |
| Fund I, strong personal network | Maybe | Can supplement personal outreach |
| Fund III+, established LP base | Usually no | LP re-ups drive majority of raise |
| International LP targeting | Yes | Local relationships and regulatory knowledge |

#### Placement Agent Economics

| Term | Typical Range |
|------|--------------|
| Retainer | $0-$25K/month |
| Success fee | 1.0-2.0% of capital raised |
| Tail provision | 12-24 months post-termination |
| Exclusivity | Often requested; negotiate carve-outs for existing relationships |

## Worked Example: Fundraising Process for Apex Growth Fund I

**Setup:** Apex Growth Fund I targets $250M. The GP team identified the following LP strategy:

**LP Targeting Plan:**

| LP Segment | Target Count | Avg Commitment | Target Capital |
|------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Anchor LP (large FoF) | 1 | $50M | $50M |
| Fund of Funds | 4-5 | $15-25M | $80M |
| Family Offices | 8-10 | $5-15M | $70M |
| HNW / Former Colleagues | 10-15 | $2-5M | $40M |
| Endowment / EM Program | 1-2 | $10-15M | $20M |
| **Total** | **25-33** | | **$260M** |

**Pipeline Tracking (Month 6):**

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| LPs contacted | 200 | 185 | On track |
| First meetings | 50 | 42 | Slightly behind |
| In DD | 15 | 11 | Behind — need more outreach |
| Committed | 5 | 3 ($45M) | Behind — focus on converting DD |
| Target first close | $100M by Month 9 | Tracking to $80M | At risk |

**Action Plan:**
1. Accelerate outreach to remaining 15 qualified LPs
2. Re-engage 8 LPs who said "keep us posted" after first meeting
3. Push hardest on 4 LPs in DD to convert before first close
4. Consider anchor LP fee discount to accelerate commitment

## PE Application

### Fundraising Dynamics for Established GPs

| Metric | Fund I | Fund III | Fund V+ |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Fundraising timeline | 12-18 months | 6-12 months | 3-6 months |
| LP re-up rate | N/A | 60-75% | 75-90% |
| New LPs needed | 100% | 30-50% | 10-25% |
| Placement agent | Often yes | Sometimes | Rarely |
| Fund size step-up | N/A | 1.5-2.0x | 1.3-1.5x |
| Key challenge | Building credibility | Scaling without diluting returns | Maintaining returns at scale |

---

## CEO Application

CEOs benefit from understanding fundraising because:

1. **Your company may be part of the pitch** — GPs often reference pipeline deals in fundraising. If your company is a potential acquisition target, you may be referenced in LP materials.

2. **Fund timing affects deal timing** — A GP mid-fundraise may be constrained on capital, affecting their ability to close your deal or fund add-on acquisitions.

3. **LP co-investment** — Understanding co-invest dynamics helps you navigate deals where LP co-investors sit alongside the GP at the ownership table.

4. **Negotiating with GPs** — Knowing a GP's fund size, deployment pace, and remaining capital helps you negotiate better deal terms.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Starting fundraise without materials | Wasting LP meetings with unpolished pitch | Prepare deck, DDQ, and data room before first meeting |
| Targeting only large institutions | Pensions won't invest in Fund I at $150M | Focus on FoFs, family offices, and EM programs |
| Not tracking pipeline rigorously | Lose momentum, miss follow-ups | Use CRM with stage tracking and conversion metrics |
| Overselling, under-delivering | LPs share notes; reputation damage | Be transparent about track record and limitations |
| Ignoring operational readiness | Fail ODD, lose institutional LPs | Invest in compliance, admin, and reporting infrastructure |
| Giving away too many side letters | Fund becomes unmanageable with 20 different terms | Maintain MFN discipline; limit material concessions |
| Waiting too long for anchor | Delays entire fundraise | Set a deadline for anchor decision; proceed without if needed |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Fundraising is a sales process** requiring the same rigor as deal execution — pipeline management, conversion tracking, and disciplined follow-up
2. **LP segmentation matters** — Fund I GPs should focus on fund of funds, family offices, and emerging manager programs
3. **The 4 Ps framework** (People, Process, Performance, Price) drives LP evaluation — know which P matters most to each LP type
4. **Prepare institutional-quality materials** before your first LP meeting — deck, DDQ, track record, and data room
5. **Conversion rates are low** (1-3% end-to-end for emerging managers) — plan for 200+ LP contacts to close 20-30 commitments
6. **Terms negotiation** is expected — have a strategy for what you'll concede and what's non-negotiable
7. **Placement agents** can accelerate fundraising but cost 1-2% of capital raised — evaluate the ROI carefully

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: LP Targeting Strategy

You're raising a $200M lower mid-market buyout fund (Fund I). Design an LP targeting strategy:
a) Which LP types will you prioritize and why?
b) How many total LPs will you need to contact to reach your target?
c) What conversion rates do you assume at each funnel stage?
d) How long do you expect the fundraise to take?

### Problem 2: Pitch Deck Critique

A GP's pitch deck makes the following claims:
- "We have generated 35% net IRR across 12 deals"
- Track record shows 8 realized deals (2.8x MOIC) and 4 unrealized (marked at 2.5x)
- The GP was a VP at a large PE firm for all deals; now starting their own fund

Identify the questions an LP would ask about this track record. What additional information would you need?

### Problem 3: Negotiation Scenario

An anchor LP is willing to commit $50M (25% of your $200M fund) but requires:
- 25 bps management fee discount
- Priority co-investment rights on all deals
- Board observer rights on the GP entity
- Right to approve all deals over $30M

Which terms would you accept, negotiate, or reject? Explain your reasoning.

### Problem 4: Fundraising Economics

A GP engages a placement agent with the following terms:
- 1.5% success fee on capital raised
- $15K/month retainer for 12 months
- 18-month tail provision

The agent raises $80M of a $200M fund. Calculate:
a) Total placement agent compensation
b) Cost per dollar raised
c) If the GP had raised the $80M independently, how would the economics differ over the fund's life?
