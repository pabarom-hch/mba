# Lesson 4: Fund Launch & First Close

> Executing the first close, building operational infrastructure, and transitioning to deployment

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain first close mechanics and minimum threshold requirements
- Walk through the subscription process from commitment to funding
- Describe capital call mechanics and default provisions
- Calculate equalization interest for subsequent closings
- Design operational infrastructure for a newly launched fund
- Outline day-one compliance requirements

---

## Introduction

The first close is the moment a fund becomes real. After months of strategy development, legal formation, and fundraising, the first close converts verbal commitments into legally binding capital and authorizes the GP to begin investing. It is both a milestone and the starting point for the fund's 10-year lifecycle.

This lesson covers the mechanics of closing — from subscription document execution through capital calls — and the operational infrastructure that must be in place on Day 1. The transition from fundraising to fund management requires a shift in mindset: the GP is now a fiduciary with legal obligations to LPs, regulatory requirements to satisfy, and a compliance program to implement.

Many first-time fund managers underestimate the operational complexity of this transition. Having an investment thesis and capital commitments is necessary but not sufficient. The GP must also build the back-office infrastructure to manage capital calls, reporting, compliance, and LP communications from the moment the fund launches.

### First Close Mechanics

#### What Constitutes a First Close

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Minimum threshold** | Typically 25-50% of target fund size |
| **Legal significance** | Fund becomes operational; GP can deploy capital |
| **LP execution** | Signed subscription agreements and KYC/AML complete |
| **Capital commitment** | LPs are legally obligated to fund capital calls |
| **GP authorization** | Investment period begins; GP can make investments |
| **Fee commencement** | Management fees begin accruing (typically from first close) |

**First Close Size Considerations:**

│  $150M (50%)         Strong — can invest with confidence      │
│  $200M (67%)         Very strong — close to target            │
│  $250M+ (83%)        Excellent — likely oversubscribed        │

### The Subscription Process

#### Step-by-Step Workflow

```
LP COMMITMENT TO FIRST CLOSE:

Step 1: LP Decision ──────────────────────────────────────────
  • LP investment committee approves commitment
  • Commitment amount and any side letter terms agreed

Step 2: Documentation (1-2 weeks) ────────────────────────────
  • LP receives subscription agreement package
  • LP completes investor questionnaire
  • KYC/AML documents collected
  • Side letter (if any) negotiated and executed

Step 3: Review & Acceptance (1 week) ─────────────────────────
  • GP counsel reviews subscription documents
  • KYC/AML verification completed
  • GP formally accepts the subscription

Step 4: Closing (1 day) ──────────────────────────────────────
  • Subscription agreement countersigned
  • LP admitted to the partnership
  • Capital commitment becomes legally binding
  • Fund administrator updates records

Step 5: Post-Close ───────────────────────────────────────────
  • Welcome letter sent to LP
  • Investor portal access provided
  • First capital call issued (if immediate deployment)
  • Management fees begin accruing
```

#### KYC/AML Requirements

| Document | Purpose | Required From |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Government ID | Identity verification | Individuals |
| Certificate of formation | Entity verification | Institutional LPs |
| Beneficial ownership form | Identify ultimate owners (>25%) | All entities |
| Source of funds documentation | AML compliance | All investors |
| W-9 / W-8BEN | Tax withholding | All investors |
| OFAC screening | Sanctions check | All investors |
| Accredited investor / QP certification | Securities law compliance | All investors |

### Capital Call Mechanics

Once the fund is operational, the GP draws capital from LP commitments through capital calls.

#### Capital Call Process

#### Capital Call Notice Contents

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Call amount | Total amount and each LP's pro-rata share |
| Purpose | Investment, management fees, fund expenses |
| Due date | Typically 10-15 business days from notice |
| Wire instructions | Bank, account, reference number |
| Remaining commitment | Each LP's unfunded commitment post-call |
| Investment detail | Brief description of the investment (if for a deal) |

#### Capital Call Example

```
Fund: Apex Growth Fund I ($250M committed, 20 LPs)
Purpose: Platform acquisition of HealthTech Corp ($40M equity)
         + Management fee (Q1) ($1.25M)
         + Fund expenses ($100K)

Total Call: $41.35M (16.5% of commitments)

Sample LP Calculation:
  LP Alpha (Family Office): $15M commitment (6.0% of fund)
  Pro-rata call: $41.35M × 6.0% = $2,481,000

  Breakdown:
    Investment: $2,400,000
    Mgmt fee:   $75,000
    Expenses:   $6,000

  Remaining unfunded: $15M - $2.481M = $12,519,000
```

#### Default Provisions

If an LP fails to fund a capital call:

| Consequence | Typical Provision |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Cure period** | 5-10 business days after due date |
| **Default interest** | Prime + 2-5% on overdue amount |
| **Forfeiture** | Up to 50% of defaulting LP's existing interest |
| **Reduction of commitment** | Unfunded commitment may be reduced to zero |
| **Loss of LPAC seat** | Immediate removal from advisory committee |
| **Non-defaulting LP rights** | Other LPs may fund the shortfall pro-rata |

### Subsequent Closes and Equalization

Most funds hold multiple closes over 12-18 months after the first close.

#### Equalization Mechanics

Late-closing LPs must "catch up" to the economic position of first-close LPs:

```
EQUALIZATION EXAMPLE:

First Close: January 1 — $150M committed
Second Close: July 1 — $50M additional committed

Between closes:
  • Capital called: $30M (20% of first-close commitments)
  • Management fee accrued: $1.5M (6 months at 2%)

Second-Close LP's Equalization:
  1. Capital call catch-up: $50M × 20% = $10M (their share of prior calls)
  2. Management fee catch-up: $50M × 2% × 6/12 = $500K
  3. Equalization interest: Interest on $10.5M at prime + 2% for 6 months
     Assume prime = 5%: $10.5M × 7% × 0.5 = $367,500

  Total second-close payment: $10M + $500K + $367,500 = $10,867,500

  The equalization interest is typically distributed to first-close LPs
  as compensation for having their capital at risk earlier.
```

#### GP Commitment Funding

| Source | Description | Considerations |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Personal capital** | GP team members invest personal funds | Strongest alignment signal |
| **Management company** | GP entity invests accumulated fee income | Available for Fund II+ |
| **GP credit facility** | Bank loan secured by management fee stream | Allows higher commitment |
| **Co-invest vehicle** | Separate vehicle for GP team and affiliates | More complex but flexible |

**GP Commitment Sizing:**

```
$250M Fund, 2% GP commitment = $5M required

Funded by:
  Managing Partner: $2.5M (personal)
  Partner 2:        $1.5M (personal)
  VP:               $500K (personal)
  GP credit line:   $500K (secured by mgmt fees)

## Worked Example: First Close of Apex Growth Fund I

**Setup:** Apex Growth Fund I targets $250M. After 10 months of fundraising, the GP has $130M in signed commitments from 15 LPs.

**First Close Decision:**

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| Minimum threshold (LPA) | $75M (30% of $250M target) |
| Actual commitments | $130M (52% of target) — exceeds minimum |
| Pipeline | $40M additional in late-stage DD |
| GP recommendation | Proceed with first close |

**Close Execution:**

| LP | Type | Commitment | % of Fund |
|----|------|-----------|-----------|
| Summit FoF | Fund of Funds | $35M | 14.0% |
| Chen Family Office | Family Office | $20M | 8.0% |
| State Pension EM Program | Pension | $15M | 6.0% |
| [12 additional LPs] | Various | $60M | 24.0% |
| **Total First Close** | | **$130M** | **52.0%** |

**First Capital Call (30 days after close):**

```
Purpose: Q1 management fees + organizational expenses
Amount: $130M × 2.0% × 25% (one quarter) = $650K
        + $250K organizational expenses (closing costs)
Total call: $900K

LP Example — Summit FoF ($35M commitment):
  Pro-rata: $900K × (35/130) = $242,308
  Remaining unfunded: $35M - $242K = $34,758K
```

### Second Close & Equalization

**Second Close Date:** September 15, 2026
**Additional Capital:** $25M
**Running Total:** $60M (80% of target)

```
EQUALIZATION CALCULATION — SECOND CLOSE LPs

Period: July 15 - September 15, 2026 (62 days)
Capital Called During Period: $6.0M (from first-close LPs)
Called %: 17.1% of first-close commitments

Second-Close LP Example — Apex Ventures ($8M commitment)

  1. Capital Call Catch-Up:
     $8M × 17.1% = $1,371,429

  2. Management Fee Catch-Up:
     $8M × 2.0% × (62/365) = $27,178

  3. Equalization Interest (Prime + 2% = 7.5%):
     ($1,371,429 + $27,178) × 7.5% × (62/365) = $17,819

  TOTAL EQUALIZATION PAYMENT: $1,416,426

  Equalization interest distributed to first-close LPs
  pro-rata based on their commitments.

## Nexus Simulation Connection

### Try the Fund Launch & First Portfolio Simulation

Apply the concepts from this lesson in an interactive exercise:

**[Fund Launch & First Portfolio Simulation](../../../cases/nexus/simulations/pe-fund-launch.md)**

In this 90-minute simulation, you will:
1. Execute first close documentation and procedures
2. Calculate and issue capital calls for your first investment
3. Model equalization for second-close LPs
4. Set up day-one operational infrastructure
5. Acquire HCH Enterprises as your platform investment

---

## PE Application

### How Established Firms Manage Closings

| Aspect | Fund I | Fund V+ |
|--------|--------|---------|
| First close timing | 10-14 months from launch | 3-6 months from launch |
| First close size | 30-50% of target | 60-80% of target |
| Number of closes | 3-5 | 2-3 |
| Time to final close | 12-18 months from first close | 6-12 months |
| LP re-ups | N/A | 75-90% from prior fund |
| Oversubscription | Rare | Common (hard cap enforcement) |

---

## CEO Application

For CEOs of companies being acquired by PE funds:

1. **Capital call timing** — The GP must call capital from LPs before closing your acquisition. This adds 10-15 business days to the closing timeline.

2. **First close vs. final close** — If you're a GP's first investment, capital is available but the fund may still be fundraising. This is normal.

3. **LP defaults** — In rare cases, LP defaults can affect available capital. This is why GPs maintain relationships with multiple LPs.

4. **Co-investment** — Large deals may involve LP co-investment alongside the fund. This means additional parties at the closing table.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| First close too small | Signals weak demand to subsequent LPs | Wait for 33%+ commitments before closing |
| No operational infrastructure at close | Can't issue capital calls or reports | Build ops 60 days before target close |
| Delayed first investment | LPs question deployment pace | Have deal pipeline ready at first close |
| Poor capital call administration | LP frustration, compliance risk | Use professional fund administrator |
| Ignoring equalization complexity | Errors in late-closer economics | Have administrator model equalization |
| Insufficient GP commitment | LPs question alignment | Commit 2%+ of fund; fund personally if possible |
| No day-one compliance program | Regulatory risk from Day 1 | Implement full program before first close |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **First close** is a legal and operational milestone — it activates the fund and begins the investment period
2. **Minimum threshold** of 25-50% of target fund size is required; 33%+ signals healthy demand
3. **The subscription process** involves documentation, KYC/AML verification, and formal acceptance
4. **Capital calls** require 10-15 business days notice and pro-rata funding from all LPs
5. **Equalization** ensures late-closing LPs catch up economically to first-close investors
6. **Operational infrastructure** (banking, admin, compliance, reporting) must be in place at first close
7. **GP commitment** of 2%+ signals alignment; fund from personal capital where possible
8. **Day-one compliance** includes Form D filing, compliance manual, code of ethics, and ongoing monitoring calendar

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: First Close Analysis

A GP is raising a $200M fund. After 8 months, they have $55M in signed commitments and $25M in "expected within 30 days." The LPA minimum for first close is $60M.

a) Should they close now, wait for the additional $25M, or continue fundraising? Consider the trade-offs.
b) If they wait and the $25M doesn't materialize, what are the implications?

### Problem 2: Capital Call Calculation

Apex Growth Fund I ($250M committed) is making its second investment: $35M equity into a manufacturing company. The fund also needs to cover $312.5K in quarterly management fees and $50K in legal expenses.

Calculate the total capital call and the pro-rata share for an LP with a $20M commitment. What is this LP's remaining unfunded commitment if they previously funded $1.5M?

### Problem 3: Equalization

Fund closed first close on January 1 with $100M committed. During the next 6 months, the fund called $15M (15%) and accrued $1M in management fees. A second close on July 1 admits $40M in new commitments. Prime rate is 5.5%.

Calculate: (a) the second-close LP's capital catch-up, (b) management fee catch-up, (c) equalization interest at prime + 2%, and (d) total payment required from the second-close LP group.

### Problem 4: Operational Readiness

You are 60 days from a planned first close of a $150M fund. Categorize the following items as (A) must be completed before close, (B) should be completed before close but can be done shortly after, or (C) can wait until after close:

1. Bank accounts opened
2. Fund administrator onboarded
3. Form D filed
4. Investor portal live
5. Compliance manual adopted
6. D&O insurance bound
7. Annual audit engagement letter signed
8. LP welcome letters drafted
