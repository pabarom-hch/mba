# Product Requirements Document: Module 29 — Fund Formation & Management

## Document Information
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Created:** February 2026
- **Parent Phase:** Phase 10: Private Equity
- **Purpose:** Add fund lifecycle content covering formation, fundraising, launch, governance, and LP relations
- **Inspiration:** Fund Launch Formula framework — adapted with academic rigor

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The Phase 10 PE curriculum (Modules 25-28) comprehensively covers the **deal side** of private equity — LBO mechanics, due diligence, operational improvement, and exits. However, it has a structural gap: there is minimal coverage of **how funds themselves are formed, capitalized, launched, and managed** as ongoing businesses.

This gap means learners understand how to execute PE deals but not how to:
- Structure and register a fund entity
- Raise capital from institutional and individual LPs
- Navigate regulatory requirements (SEC, state)
- Manage a fund as an ongoing business (governance, portfolio construction, IR)
- Transition from Fund I to Fund II

### 1.2 Solution

Add **Module 29: Fund Formation & Management** — a 6-lesson module that completes the fund lifecycle, mapping directly to the two phases identified in the Fund Launch Formula:

1. **Fund Launch** (Lessons 1-4): Strategy → Validation → Legal Formation → Capital Raising → First Close
2. **Fund Management** (Lessons 5-6): Governance → Portfolio Management → LP Relations → Fund Performance → Fund II

### 1.3 Target Learners

| Learner Profile | How Module 29 Helps |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Aspiring Fund Managers** | End-to-end playbook for launching a fund |
| **PE Professionals** | Understanding the GP business behind the deals |
| **PE-backed CEOs** | Understanding fund dynamics that affect their company |
| **Allocators/LPs** | Framework for evaluating emerging managers |
| **Family Office Principals** | Knowledge to launch proprietary investment vehicles |

### 1.4 Dependencies & Prerequisites

- **Module 25** (PE Fundamentals): GP/LP structures, fund economics, carried interest
- **Module 28** (Exit & Returns): LP reporting metrics (DPI, RVPI, TVPI), J-curve
- References but does not duplicate existing content
