# Lesson 6: Fund Performance & LP Relations

> Managing investor relationships, communicating performance, and building toward Fund II

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Design an investor relations program for a PE fund
- Prepare quarterly and annual LP reports to institutional standards
- Calculate and present distribution waterfall mechanics for European and American structures
- Evaluate fund extension and wind-down decisions
- Determine Fund II timing, sizing, and positioning based on Fund I performance
- Assess GP platform maturity and institutional readiness

---

## Introduction

LP relations is the connective tissue of the GP business. While deal-making generates returns, the ability to communicate those returns — and maintain LP confidence through market cycles — determines whether a GP builds a lasting platform or remains a one-fund operation.

This lesson builds on Module 28 Lesson 4 (LP Reporting & Fund Performance), which introduced fund-level metrics like DPI, RVPI, and TVPI. Here we go deeper into the IR program design, waterfall calculations, fund lifecycle management, and the strategic decisions that bridge Fund I to Fund II.

The transition from Fund I to Fund II is the most critical inflection point for an emerging manager. LPs expect demonstrable progress — realized returns, team stability, and operational maturity — before committing to a successor fund. Understanding what LPs evaluate, and when to start the Fund II process, is essential for building a multi-fund platform.

## Core Concepts

### Investor Relations Program Design

#### IR Function Structure

| Fund Size | IR Approach | Staffing |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| <$200M | GP principals handle IR directly | No dedicated IR |
| $200M-$500M | Dedicated IR professional (1 person) | IR associate or VP |
| $500M-$2B | IR team (2-3 people) | Head of IR + associates |
| $2B+ | Full IR department | VP IR, associates, operations |

#### Communication Strategy

#### Performance Attribution

| Attribution Component | How to Calculate | What It Shows |
|----------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Revenue growth** | Exit revenue vs. entry revenue × margin | Organic value creation |

### Distribution Waterfall — Detailed Calculations

#### European (Whole-Fund) Waterfall

**Example: $200M Fund, 8% Preferred Return, 100% GP Catch-Up, 20% Carry**

```
Fund Life: 7 years
Total Capital Called: $190M
Total Realizations: $475M

STEP 1: RETURN OF CAPITAL
  Distribute to LPs: $190M
  Remaining: $475M - $190M = $285M

STEP 2: PREFERRED RETURN (8% compounded)
  LP preferred on $190M over ~5 avg years:
  $190M × (1.08^5 - 1) = $190M × 0.469 = $89.1M
  Distribute to LPs: $89.1M
  Remaining: $285M - $89.1M = $195.9M

STEP 3: GP CATCH-UP (100% to GP)
  Total profit = $285M
  GP target = 20% × $285M = $57M
  GP receives 100% until caught up: $57M
  Remaining: $195.9M - $57M = $138.9M

STEP 4: 80/20 SPLIT
  LPs: $138.9M × 80% = $111.1M
  GP:  $138.9M × 20% = $27.8M

#### American (Deal-by-Deal) Waterfall

**Same fund, but carry calculated per deal:**

```
Deal A: $30M invested, $90M returned (3.0x) after 4 years
Deal B: $25M invested, $50M returned (2.0x) after 3 years
Deal C: $20M invested, $12M returned (0.6x) after 5 years (LOSS)

DEAL A WATERFALL:
  Step 1: Return $30M to LPs
  Step 2: Preferred ($30M × 1.08^4 - $30M) = $10.8M to LPs
  Step 3: GP catch-up: 20% of $60M profit = $12M
  Step 4: Remaining $37.2M → LP: $29.8M, GP: $7.4M
  GP carry from Deal A: $19.4M

DEAL B WATERFALL:
  Step 1: Return $25M to LPs
  Step 2: Preferred ($25M × 1.08^3 - $25M) = $6.5M to LPs
  Step 3: GP catch-up: 20% of $25M profit = $5M
  Step 4: Remaining $13.5M → LP: $10.8M, GP: $2.7M
  GP carry from Deal B: $7.7M

DEAL C: LOSS
  Return $12M to LPs (partial return of capital)
  No carry generated
  Loss = $8M

AMERICAN WATERFALL TOTAL:
  GP carry: $19.4M + $7.7M = $27.1M
  BUT: Deal C lost $8M — no offset against prior carry
  → This is why European waterfalls are LP-preferred

COMPARISON:
  European waterfall GP carry: $84.8M (calculated on net fund return)
  American waterfall GP carry: $27.1M (only on winners, but paid earlier)
  Note: Full-fund numbers would differ; this illustrates per-deal mechanics
```

#### Clawback Provisions

In deal-by-deal waterfalls, the GP may owe a **clawback** at fund termination:

| Scenario | Clawback Triggered |
|----------|-------------------|
| Early deals profitable, later deals lose money | Yes — GP received excess carry |
| Fund overall below preferred return | Yes — GP must return carry |
| GP carry correctly reflects final fund economics | No clawback needed |

**Clawback Mechanics:**
- Calculated at fund termination
- GP must return excess carry (after tax gross-up in some LPAs)
- Typically secured by escrow (10-30% of carry held back)
- Personal guarantees from GP principals may be required

### Fund Extension Decisions

#### When Extensions Are Needed

| Scenario | Typical Response |
|----------|-----------------|
| Unrealized portfolio companies at Year 10 | Request 1-year extension |
| Market downturn depressed exit valuations | Request extension until recovery |
| Add-on acquisition in progress | Extension to complete and integrate |
| IPO lock-up period extends past fund term | Extension to sell public shares |

#### Extension Mechanics

| Provision | Standard Terms |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Number of extensions** | 2× one-year (per LPA) |
| **Approval required** | LPAC consent or LP majority vote |
| **Fee adjustment** | Management fee often reduced (1.0-1.5% on invested) |
| **New investments** | No new platform investments during extension |
| **GP incentive** | Extension should maximize LP returns, not delay exits |

#### Continuation Vehicles (GP-Led Secondaries)

An alternative to fund extension — the GP transfers assets to a new vehicle:

| Feature | Fund Extension | Continuation Vehicle |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Structure** | Same fund, extended term | New vehicle, fresh term |
| **LP option** | Stay invested (mandatory) | Cash out or roll over |
| **Pricing** | No transaction | Third-party valuation, LP tender |
| **GP economics** | Existing carry continues | New carry on go-forward performance |
| **Term** | 1-2 additional years | 3-5 new years |
| **Market growth** | N/A | $50B+ annual market |

### Wind-Down Procedures

#### Final Distribution Process

```
FUND WIND-DOWN TIMELINE:

Year 10-12: Final Exits
├─ Sell remaining portfolio companies
├─ Distribute proceeds per waterfall
├─ Final capital account reconciliation
└─ Clawback calculation (if applicable)

Post-Final Exit:
├─ Final audit engagement
├─ K-1 preparation and distribution
├─ Clawback settlement (escrow release or GP payment)
├─ Final LPAC meeting
├─ Legal dissolution filing
└─ Record retention (5-7 years post-dissolution)
```

#### Fund II Sizing

| Factor | Guideline | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Step-up from Fund I** | 1.5-2.5x | Market standard for strong performers |
| **LP re-up rate** | 75-90% (top quartile) | Returning LPs are the base |
| **New LP acquisition** | 20-40% of Fund II from new LPs | Growth and diversification |
| **Team capacity** | Can deploy within 4-5 year investment period | Don't over-raise |
| **Deal flow** | Sufficient opportunities at target size | Market supports larger fund |

**Fund II Sizing Example:**

```
Fund I: $200M
Fund I Performance: 2.2x gross MOIC, 18% net IRR (top quartile)

Re-up Analysis:
  Fund I LPs willing to re-up: 80% = $160M equivalent
  Average re-up increase: 25% = $200M from returning LPs
  New LPs targeted: $150M
  Total Fund II target: $350M (1.75x step-up)

Capacity Check:
  Deal size increase: $15-25M → $20-35M equity (supported)
  Team growth: 4 → 6 professionals (hire 2 before Fund II)
  Deal count target: 10-12 deals (consistent with Fund I)
  Deployment pace: $350M / 4 years = $87.5M/year (manageable)
```

#### LP Re-Up Decision Framework

What existing LPs evaluate before committing to Fund II:

| Factor | Top Quartile (Re-Up Likely) | Below Median (At Risk) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **DPI** | >0.5x by Fund II raise | <0.2x |
| **Gross MOIC** | >1.8x (incl. unrealized) | <1.3x |
| **Net IRR** | >15% | <10% |
| **Team stability** | No key departures | Key person turnover |
| **Strategy consistency** | Same thesis, refined | Significant strategy drift |
| **Operational maturity** | Professional operations, clean audits | Operational issues |
| **Communication quality** | Proactive, transparent | Reactive, opaque |
| **Loss ratio** | <15% of deals below 1.0x | >30% of deals below 1.0x |

## Worked Example: Fund I to Fund II Transition

**Scenario:** Apex Growth Fund I ($200M, 2020 vintage) is 3.5 years in.

**Fund I Performance Summary:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Capital called | $175M (87.5%) |
| Investments | 9 platforms + 6 add-ons |
| Realized exits | 2 (1.8x and 3.2x gross MOIC) |
| Total distributions | $85M |
| Remaining NAV | $210M |
| DPI | 0.49x |
| RVPI | 1.20x |
| TVPI | 1.69x |
| Gross IRR | 22% |
| Net IRR | 16% |

**Fund II Decision Analysis:**

| Factor | Assessment | Signal |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Deployment | 87.5% — in the target window | Green |
| DPI | 0.49x — approaching 0.5x threshold | Yellow/Green |
| Performance | Top quartile net IRR | Green |
| Team | All 4 founding members retained; hired 2 VPs | Green |
| Operations | Clean audits, no compliance issues | Green |
| LP feedback | 85% indicate willingness to re-up | Green |

**Fund II Plan:**

```
Target: $350M (1.75x step-up)

LP Strategy:
  Returning LPs (85% × $200M × 1.25 re-up): ~$212M
  New LPs needed: ~$138M
  New LP targets: 2 endowments, 3 FoFs, 5 family offices

Timeline:
  Month 1-2: Update materials, begin market sounding
  Month 3-6: Active fundraising, first close target
  Month 7-12: Subsequent closes
  Month 12-15: Final close

Terms Evolution:
  Management fee: 2.0%/1.5% → 2.0%/1.5% (maintained)
  Carry: 20% → 20% (maintained)
  GP commitment: 2% → 2.5% ($8.75M — shows increased conviction)
  Fund term: 10+2 → 10+2 (standard)

### Quarterly LP Letter (Sample)

```
SAF PARTNERS FUND I
Quarterly Update — Q4 2028

Dear Limited Partners,

We are pleased to report another strong quarter for SAF Partners
Fund I, with net TVPI increasing to 1.35x and the portfolio
continuing to exceed our value creation targets.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS:
• HCH Enterprises achieved 15% EBITDA margin — turnaround complete
• DataServe Federal add-on realized at 2.1x MOIC (18-month hold)
• CyberDefense Inc closed December 1; 100-day plan underway
• Platform #4 (IT consulting, $18M revenue) under LOI

PERFORMANCE:
Our 22.3% net IRR ranks in the top quartile of 2026 vintage funds,
driven by the successful HCH turnaround and disciplined execution
of our government IT services thesis.

DEPLOYMENT:
We have deployed 60% of committed capital across 3 platforms and
2 add-ons, with a fourth platform expected to close in Q1 2029.
This pace positions us for Fund II discussions beginning mid-2029.

LOOKING AHEAD:
HCH is now generating strong cash flow and is positioned for a
potential exit in 2030-2031. We are building the pipeline for
continued add-on acquisitions across all platforms.

We remain grateful for your partnership and confidence in SAF.

Sincerely,
Marcus Chen, Sarah Rodriguez, David Park
SAF Partners

  Average re-up increase:          30%
  Re-up capital:                   $73.1M × 85% × 1.3 = $80.8M

New LP Acquisition:
  Target new LPs:                  8-12
  Average new commitment:          $6M
  New LP capital:                  $60M

GP Commitment:
  Target:                          3% (increased from 2.5%)
  GP capital:                      $4.5M

TOTAL FUND II TARGET:              $145M (hard cap $175M)
STEP-UP RATIO:                     1.9x (within 1.5-2.5x range)

Capacity Validation:
  Target deal size increase:       $5-15M → $8-20M (supported)
  Team growth:                     3 → 5 professionals (hire 2)
  Deployment pace:                 $145M / 4 years = $36M/year
  Historical pace:                 $52M / 2 years = $26M/year ← achievable

## Nexus Simulation Connection

### Try the Fund Performance & LP Relations Simulation

Apply the concepts from this lesson in an interactive exercise:

**[Fund Performance & LP Relations Simulation](../../../cases/nexus/simulations/pe-fund-performance.md)**

In this 75-minute simulation, you will:
1. Calculate and present SAF Fund I performance metrics
2. Write a quarterly LP letter addressing underperformance
3. Model the distribution waterfall for a partial exit
4. Assess Fund II readiness and develop a sizing strategy
5. Handle difficult LP conversations about fund extension

---

## PE Application

### How Multi-Billion Dollar Platforms Manage LP Relations

| Practice | Emerging GP | Institutional GP |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Annual meeting | 20-30 LPs, half-day | 100+ LPs, full-day event |
| Reporting technology | Basic portal | Custom LP portal with real-time data |
| ESG reporting | Minimal | Comprehensive annual ESG report |
| Co-investment | Opportunistic | Dedicated co-invest program with team |
| Advisory board | LPAC only | LPAC + sector advisory boards |
| Thought leadership | Limited | White papers, conferences, research |

---

## CEO Application

For CEOs, understanding fund performance and LP dynamics helps you:

1. **Negotiate exit timing** — If the fund is performing well (top quartile), the GP has less pressure to force exits. If the fund is underperforming, expect more urgency.

2. **Understand GP motivations** — A GP raising Fund II needs strong Fund I performance metrics. Your company's performance directly affects their fundraising.

3. **Anticipate governance changes** — As the fund approaches end of life, your PE sponsor's behavior may change — more focus on exits, less on long-term investment.

4. **Participate in continuation vehicles** — If the GP offers a GP-led secondary for your company, understand the mechanics and your options.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Reporting delays | LPs lose confidence, miss allocation cycles | Deliver quarterly reports within 45 days of quarter end |
| Cherry-picking metrics | Present only favorable numbers | Report gross and net, realized and unrealized, with benchmarks |
| Ignoring underperformers | Erodes credibility when losses are realized | Address write-downs proactively in LP communications |
| Starting Fund II too early | Insufficient track record, LP skepticism | Wait for 60-75% deployment and ideally 1-2 realized exits |
| Starting Fund II too late | Team retention risk, deal flow gap | Begin marketing before 90% deployed |
| Overstepping on Fund II | 3x+ step-up without justification | 1.5-2.5x is typical; size to deployment capacity |
| Neglecting small LPs | Small Fund I LPs become larger Fund II investors | Treat all LPs with equal communication quality |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **IR is a competitive advantage** — proactive, transparent communication builds LP loyalty and Fund II re-ups
2. **Quarterly reporting** to ILPA standards is the institutional expectation — include letter, financials, portfolio updates, and capital accounts
3. **European waterfall** provides stronger LP protection; understand the step-by-step mechanics for both structures
4. **Fund extensions** require LPAC/LP consent and should serve LP interests, not delay inevitable outcomes
5. **Fund II timing** is critical — begin marketing when Fund I is 60-75% deployed with some realized performance
6. **LP re-up rates** of 75-90% indicate a healthy GP-LP relationship; below 60% is a warning sign
7. **Building an institutional platform** requires investing in people, processes, and technology beyond the deal team

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Waterfall Calculation

A $300M fund (European waterfall, 8% preferred, 80% catch-up, 20% carry) has the following results over its 8-year life:
- Total called: $285M
- Total distributions: $712M

Calculate: (a) LP preferred return, (b) GP catch-up amount (note: 80% catch-up, not 100%), (c) remaining 80/20 split, (d) total LP and GP distributions, (e) net LP MOIC.

### Problem 2: Fund II Sizing

Fund I ($150M) has the following performance at Year 4:
- DPI: 0.35x
- RVPI: 1.45x
- TVPI: 1.80x
- 12 LP commitments

You expect 75% LP re-up rate with an average 20% increase. You plan to add 8 new LPs averaging $8M each.

a) Calculate target Fund II size
b) Is this an appropriate step-up ratio?
c) What risks exist with this sizing?

### Problem 3: LP Communication

Your fund's best-performing investment (marked at 4.5x) just received a downward valuation revision to 3.0x due to market conditions. This reduces your TVPI from 1.8x to 1.5x.

Draft the key messages for: (a) the quarterly letter to all LPs, (b) a proactive call to your top 5 LPs, and (c) the LPAC meeting discussion.

### Problem 4: Continuation Vehicle

Your 10-year fund holds 3 remaining portfolio companies. Two are ready to sell within 12 months, but one (your largest position, 25% of remaining NAV) needs 3+ more years of value creation.

Compare: (a) requesting a 2-year fund extension, (b) selling all three companies now, and (c) creating a continuation vehicle for the largest position. Analyze the economics and LP impact of each option.
