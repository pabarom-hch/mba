# Lesson 6: Fund Performance & LP Relations

> Managing investor relationships, communicating performance, and building toward Fund II

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Design an investor relations program for a PE fund
- Prepare quarterly and annual LP reports to institutional standards
- Calculate and present distribution waterfall mechanics for European and American structures
- Evaluate fund extension and wind-down decisions
- Determine Fund II timing, sizing, and positioning based on Fund I performance
- Assess GP platform maturity and institutional readiness

---

## Introduction

LP relations is the connective tissue of the GP business. While deal-making generates returns, the ability to communicate those returns — and maintain LP confidence through market cycles — determines whether a GP builds a lasting platform or remains a one-fund operation.

This lesson builds on Module 28 Lesson 4 (LP Reporting & Fund Performance), which introduced fund-level metrics like DPI, RVPI, and TVPI. Here we go deeper into the IR program design, waterfall calculations, fund lifecycle management, and the strategic decisions that bridge Fund I to Fund II.

The transition from Fund I to Fund II is the most critical inflection point for an emerging manager. LPs expect demonstrable progress — realized returns, team stability, and operational maturity — before committing to a successor fund. Understanding what LPs evaluate, and when to start the Fund II process, is essential for building a multi-fund platform.

## Core Concepts

### Investor Relations Program Design

#### IR Function Structure

| Fund Size | IR Approach | Staffing |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| <$200M | GP principals handle IR directly | No dedicated IR |
| $200M-$500M | Dedicated IR professional (1 person) | IR associate or VP |
| $500M-$2B | IR team (2-3 people) | Head of IR + associates |
| $2B+ | Full IR department | VP IR, associates, operations |

#### Communication Strategy

#### Performance Attribution

| Attribution Component | How to Calculate | What It Shows |
|----------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Revenue growth** | Exit revenue vs. entry revenue × margin | Organic value creation |

### Distribution Waterfall — Detailed Calculations

#### European (Whole-Fund) Waterfall

**Example: $200M Fund, 8% Preferred Return, 100% GP Catch-Up, 20% Carry**

```
Fund Life: 7 years
Total Capital Called: $190M
Total Realizations: $475M

STEP 1: RETURN OF CAPITAL
  Distribute to LPs: $190M
  Remaining: $475M - $190M = $285M

STEP 2: PREFERRED RETURN (8% compounded)
  LP preferred on $190M over ~5 avg years:
  $190M × (1.08^5 - 1) = $190M × 0.469 = $89.1M
  Distribute to LPs: $89.1M
  Remaining: $285M - $89.1M = $195.9M

STEP 3: GP CATCH-UP (100% to GP)
  Total profit = $285M
  GP target = 20% × $285M = $57M
  GP receives 100% until caught up: $57M
  Remaining: $195.9M - $57M = $138.9M

STEP 4: 80/20 SPLIT
  LPs: $138.9M × 80% = $111.1M
  GP:  $138.9M × 20% = $27.8M

#### American (Deal-by-Deal) Waterfall

**Same fund, but carry calculated per deal:**

```
Deal A: $30M invested, $90M returned (3.0x) after 4 years
Deal B: $25M invested, $50M returned (2.0x) after 3 years
Deal C: $20M invested, $12M returned (0.6x) after 5 years (LOSS)

DEAL A WATERFALL:
  Step 1: Return $30M to LPs
  Step 2: Preferred ($30M × 1.08^4 - $30M) = $10.8M to LPs
  Step 3: GP catch-up: 20% of $60M profit = $12M
  Step 4: Remaining $37.2M → LP: $29.8M, GP: $7.4M
  GP carry from Deal A: $19.4M

DEAL B WATERFALL:
  Step 1: Return $25M to LPs
  Step 2: Preferred ($25M × 1.08^3 - $25M) = $6.5M to LPs
  Step 3: GP catch-up: 20% of $25M profit = $5M
  Step 4: Remaining $13.5M → LP: $10.8M, GP: $2.7M
  GP carry from Deal B: $7.7M

DEAL C: LOSS
  Return $12M to LPs (partial return of capital)
  No carry generated
  Loss = $8M

AMERICAN WATERFALL TOTAL:
  GP carry: $19.4M + $7.7M = $27.1M
  BUT: Deal C lost $8M — no offset against prior carry
  → This is why European waterfalls are LP-preferred

COMPARISON:
  European waterfall GP carry: $84.8M (calculated on net fund return)
  American waterfall GP carry: $27.1M (only on winners, but paid earlier)
  Note: Full-fund numbers would differ; this illustrates per-deal mechanics
```

#### Clawback Provisions

In deal-by-deal waterfalls, the GP may owe a **clawback** at fund termination:

| Scenario | Clawback Triggered |
|----------|-------------------|
| Early deals profitable, later deals lose money | Yes — GP received excess carry |
| Fund overall below preferred return | Yes — GP must return carry |
| GP carry correctly reflects final fund economics | No clawback needed |

**Clawback Mechanics:**
- Calculated at fund termination
- GP must return excess carry (after tax gross-up in some LPAs)
- Typically secured by escrow (10-30% of carry held back)
- Personal guarantees from GP principals may be required

### Fund Extension Decisions

#### When Extensions Are Needed

| Scenario | Typical Response |
|----------|-----------------|
| Unrealized portfolio companies at Year 10 | Request 1-year extension |
| Market downturn depressed exit valuations | Request extension until recovery |
| Add-on acquisition in progress | Extension to complete and integrate |
| IPO lock-up period extends past fund term | Extension to sell public shares |

#### Extension Mechanics

| Provision | Standard Terms |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Number of extensions** | 2× one-year (per LPA) |
| **Approval required** | LPAC consent or LP majority vote |
| **Fee adjustment** | Management fee often reduced (1.0-1.5% on invested) |
| **New investments** | No new platform investments during extension |
| **GP incentive** | Extension should maximize LP returns, not delay exits |

#### Continuation Vehicles (GP-Led Secondaries)

An alternative to fund extension — the GP transfers assets to a new vehicle:

| Feature | Fund Extension | Continuation Vehicle |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Structure** | Same fund, extended term | New vehicle, fresh term |
| **LP option** | Stay invested (mandatory) | Cash out or roll over |
| **Pricing** | No transaction | Third-party valuation, LP tender |
| **GP economics** | Existing carry continues | New carry on go-forward performance |
| **Term** | 1-2 additional years | 3-5 new years |
| **Market growth** | N/A | $50B+ annual market |

### Wind-Down Procedures

#### Final Distribution Process

```
FUND WIND-DOWN TIMELINE:

Year 10-12: Final Exits
├─ Sell remaining portfolio companies
├─ Distribute proceeds per waterfall
├─ Final capital account reconciliation
└─ Clawback calculation (if applicable)

Post-Final Exit:
├─ Final audit engagement
├─ K-1 preparation and distribution
├─ Clawback settlement (escrow release or GP payment)
├─ Final LPAC meeting
├─ Legal dissolution filing
└─ Record retention (5-7 years post-dissolution)
```

#### Fund II Sizing

| Factor | Guideline | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Step-up from Fund I** | 1.5-2.5x | Market standard for strong performers |
| **LP re-up rate** | 75-90% (top quartile) | Returning LPs are the base |
| **New LP acquisition** | 20-40% of Fund II from new LPs | Growth and diversification |
| **Team capacity** | Can deploy within 4-5 year investment period | Don't over-raise |
| **Deal flow** | Sufficient opportunities at target size | Market supports larger fund |

**Fund II Sizing Example:**

```
Fund I: $200M
Fund I Performance: 2.2x gross MOIC, 18% net IRR (top quartile)

Re-up Analysis:
  Fund I LPs willing to re-up: 80% = $160M equivalent
  Average re-up increase: 25% = $200M from returning LPs
  New LPs targeted: $150M
  Total Fund II target: $350M (1.75x step-up)

Capacity Check:
  Deal size increase: $15-25M → $20-35M equity (supported)
  Team growth: 4 → 6 professionals (hire 2 before Fund II)
  Deal count target: 10-12 deals (consistent with Fund I)
  Deployment pace: $350M / 4 years = $87.5M/year (manageable)
```

#### LP Re-Up Decision Framework

What existing LPs evaluate before committing to Fund II:

| Factor | Top Quartile (Re-Up Likely) | Below Median (At Risk) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **DPI** | >0.5x by Fund II raise | <0.2x |
| **Gross MOIC** | >1.8x (incl. unrealized) | <1.3x |
| **Net IRR** | >15% | <10% |
| **Team stability** | No key departures | Key person turnover |
| **Strategy consistency** | Same thesis, refined | Significant strategy drift |
| **Operational maturity** | Professional operations, clean audits | Operational issues |
| **Communication quality** | Proactive, transparent | Reactive, opaque |
| **Loss ratio** | <15% of deals below 1.0x | >30% of deals below 1.0x |

## Worked Example: Fund I to Fund II Transition

**Scenario:** Apex Growth Fund I ($200M, 2020 vintage) is 3.5 years in.

**Fund I Performance Summary:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Capital called | $175M (87.5%) |
| Investments | 9 platforms + 6 add-ons |
| Realized exits | 2 (1.8x and 3.2x gross MOIC) |
| Total distributions | $85M |
| Remaining NAV | $210M |
| DPI | 0.49x |
| RVPI | 1.20x |
| TVPI | 1.69x |
| Gross IRR | 22% |
| Net IRR | 16% |

**Fund II Decision Analysis:**

| Factor | Assessment | Signal |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Deployment | 87.5% — in the target window | Green |
| DPI | 0.49x — approaching 0.5x threshold | Yellow/Green |
| Performance | Top quartile net IRR | Green |
| Team | All 4 founding members retained; hired 2 VPs | Green |
| Operations | Clean audits, no compliance issues | Green |
| LP feedback | 85% indicate willingness to re-up | Green |

**Fund II Plan:**

```
Target: $350M (1.75x step-up)

LP Strategy:
  Returning LPs (85% × $200M × 1.25 re-up): ~$212M
  New LPs needed: ~$138M
  New LP targets: 2 endowments, 3 FoFs, 5 family offices

Timeline:
  Month 1-2: Update materials, begin market sounding
  Month 3-6: Active fundraising, first close target
  Month 7-12: Subsequent closes
  Month 12-15: Final close

Terms Evolution:
  Management fee: 2.0%/1.5% → 2.0%/1.5% (maintained)
  Carry: 20% → 20% (maintained)
  GP commitment: 2% → 2.5% ($8.75M — shows increased conviction)
  Fund term: 10+2 → 10+2 (standard)
```

## PE Application

### How Multi-Billion Dollar Platforms Manage LP Relations

| Practice | Emerging GP | Institutional GP |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Annual meeting | 20-30 LPs, half-day | 100+ LPs, full-day event |
| Reporting technology | Basic portal | Custom LP portal with real-time data |
| ESG reporting | Minimal | Comprehensive annual ESG report |
| Co-investment | Opportunistic | Dedicated co-invest program with team |
| Advisory board | LPAC only | LPAC + sector advisory boards |
| Thought leadership | Limited | White papers, conferences, research |

## CEO Application

For CEOs, understanding fund performance and LP dynamics helps you:

1. **Negotiate exit timing** — If the fund is performing well (top quartile), the GP has less pressure to force exits. If the fund is underperforming, expect more urgency.

2. **Understand GP motivations** — A GP raising Fund II needs strong Fund I performance metrics. Your company's performance directly affects their fundraising.

3. **Anticipate governance changes** — As the fund approaches end of life, your PE sponsor's behavior may change — more focus on exits, less on long-term investment.

4. **Participate in continuation vehicles** — If the GP offers a GP-led secondary for your company, understand the mechanics and your options.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Reporting delays | LPs lose confidence, miss allocation cycles | Deliver quarterly reports within 45 days of quarter end |
| Cherry-picking metrics | Present only favorable numbers | Report gross and net, realized and unrealized, with benchmarks |
| Ignoring underperformers | Erodes credibility when losses are realized | Address write-downs proactively in LP communications |
| Starting Fund II too early | Insufficient track record, LP skepticism | Wait for 60-75% deployment and ideally 1-2 realized exits |
| Starting Fund II too late | Team retention risk, deal flow gap | Begin marketing before 90% deployed |
| Overstepping on Fund II | 3x+ step-up without justification | 1.5-2.5x is typical; size to deployment capacity |
| Neglecting small LPs | Small Fund I LPs become larger Fund II investors | Treat all LPs with equal communication quality |

## Key Takeaways

1. **IR is a competitive advantage** — proactive, transparent communication builds LP loyalty and Fund II re-ups
2. **Quarterly reporting** to ILPA standards is the institutional expectation — include letter, financials, portfolio updates, and capital accounts
3. **European waterfall** provides stronger LP protection; understand the step-by-step mechanics for both structures
4. **Fund extensions** require LPAC/LP consent and should serve LP interests, not delay inevitable outcomes
5. **Fund II timing** is critical — begin marketing when Fund I is 60-75% deployed with some realized performance
6. **LP re-up rates** of 75-90% indicate a healthy GP-LP relationship; below 60% is a warning sign
7. **Building an institutional platform** requires investing in people, processes, and technology beyond the deal team

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Waterfall Calculation

A $300M fund (European waterfall, 8% preferred, 80% catch-up, 20% carry) has the following results over its 8-year life:
- Total called: $285M
- Total distributions: $712M

Calculate: (a) LP preferred return, (b) GP catch-up amount (note: 80% catch-up, not 100%), (c) remaining 80/20 split, (d) total LP and GP distributions, (e) net LP MOIC.

### Problem 2: Fund II Sizing

Fund I ($150M) has the following performance at Year 4:
- DPI: 0.35x
- RVPI: 1.45x
- TVPI: 1.80x
- 12 LP commitments

You expect 75% LP re-up rate with an average 20% increase. You plan to add 8 new LPs averaging $8M each.

a) Calculate target Fund II size
b) Is this an appropriate step-up ratio?
c) What risks exist with this sizing?

### Problem 3: LP Communication

Your fund's best-performing investment (marked at 4.5x) just received a downward valuation revision to 3.0x due to market conditions. This reduces your TVPI from 1.8x to 1.5x.

Draft the key messages for: (a) the quarterly letter to all LPs, (b) a proactive call to your top 5 LPs, and (c) the LPAC meeting discussion.

### Problem 4: Continuation Vehicle

Your 10-year fund holds 3 remaining portfolio companies. Two are ready to sell within 12 months, but one (your largest position, 25% of remaining NAV) needs 3+ more years of value creation.

Compare: (a) requesting a 2-year fund extension, (b) selling all three companies now, and (c) creating a continuation vehicle for the largest position. Analyze the economics and LP impact of each option.
