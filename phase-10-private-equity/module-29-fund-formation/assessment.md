- A) Immediately after Fund I's first close
- B) After Fund I is fully deployed (typically Year 3-4), with early exits or strong markups demonstrating proof of concept
- C) Only after Fund I has been fully exited and all capital returned

## Section 2: Fund Economics Calculator (20 points)

### Problem 1: GP Economics Model (8 points)

Ridgeline Capital Partners is launching a $300M lower middle-market buyout fund with the following terms:

**Fee Structure:**
- Management fee: 2.0% on committed capital during the 5-year investment period
- Management fee: 1.5% on invested capital (net of realized exits) during the 5-year harvest period (Years 6-10)
- GP commitment: 3% of fund size ($9M)
- Carried interest: 20% over an 8% preferred return (European waterfall)

**Deployment and Exit Schedule:**

| Year | Cumulative Capital Invested | Cumulative Exits (at Cost) |
|------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | $60M | $0 |
| 2 | $120M | $0 |
| 3 | $200M | $0 |
| 4 | $270M | $0 |
| 5 | $285M | $0 |
| 6 | $285M | $30M |
| 7 | $285M | $80M |
| 8 | $285M | $160M |
| 9 | $285M | $230M |
| 10 | $285M | $285M |

**GP Operating Costs:**
- Annual compensation and overhead: $4.5M (Years 1-5), $3.8M (Years 6-10)

**Calculate:**

a) Total management fees over the 10-year fund life. (3 points)

b) In which year does the GP's cumulative management fee revenue first exceed cumulative operating costs (i.e., break-even for the management company)? (2 points)

c) If the fund achieves a gross MOIC of 2.5x on invested capital, calculate the total carried interest earned by the GP (assume European waterfall with full catch-up). (3 points)

---

### Problem 2: Waterfall Calculation (7 points)

Summit Growth Fund I ($200M committed, $190M invested) has completed all exits. The fund operates under a European waterfall with the following terms:

- Preferred return: 8% IRR (compounded annually)
- Catch-up: 100% to GP until GP has received 20% of total profits
- Carried interest: 20/80 split after catch-up
- GP commitment: $4M (2%)
- Fund life: 6 years (assume all capital called at inception for simplicity)

**Total distributions available:** $475M

**Calculate the step-by-step waterfall distribution:** (7 points)

a) Step 1 — Return of contributed capital to all partners

b) Step 2 — Preferred return to all partners (8% compounded annually over 6 years)

c) Step 3 — GP catch-up

d) Step 4 — Carried interest split (80/20)

e) Total to LPs vs. Total to GP

---

### Problem 3: Fund II Sizing (5 points)

Ridgeline Capital Partners (from Problem 1) is now raising Fund II. Use the following assumptions:

**Fund I Performance:**
- Fund I size: $300M
- Fund I deployed: $285M across 10 deals (avg. deal size: $28.5M)
- Fund I is in Year 4 with a gross MOIC of 1.8x on deployed capital (based on realized and unrealized values)
- Fund I invested over 4.5 years

**Fund II Assumptions:**
- Target deal size growth: 40% larger than Fund I average (reflecting move upmarket)
- Target number of deals: 12 (Fund I had 10)
- LP re-up rate: 70% of Fund I LPs expected to re-commit (Fund I had $291M from LPs)
- New LP target: Replace non-returning LPs and add 30% additional capital

**Calculate:**

a) Target average deal size for Fund II. (1 point)

b) Target Fund II size based on deployment capacity (deal size x number of deals). (1 point)

c) Expected re-up capital from existing Fund I LPs. (1 point)

d) Required new LP capital to reach the target fund size. (1 point)

e) Is the target fund size realistic given the LP math? Provide your assessment. (1 point)

## Section 3: Fund Strategy Analysis (20 points)

### Question 1: Strategy Evaluation (7 points)

Evaluate the following fund strategy description and identify its strengths and weaknesses:

> **Apex Ventures Fund I — $500M Target**
>
> "Apex Ventures is a newly formed growth equity firm led by two former investment bankers with 8 years of experience each at a bulge bracket bank. The fund will target technology, healthcare, consumer, industrial, and financial services companies across North America, Europe, and Asia with revenue between $5M and $500M. We will invest $10M-$75M per deal and target 15-20 portfolio companies. Our differentiation is our superior analytical ability and access to our banking network for deal flow. We project 3x net returns."

Identify at least **three strengths** and **three weaknesses** of this strategy. For each weakness, suggest how it could be improved.

---

### Question 2: Fundraising Approach Assessment (7 points)

A first-time GP shares the following fundraising plan for a $150M Fund I:

> "We plan to raise our fund in 4 months. Our strategy is to email our 400-page PPM to 500 institutional LPs simultaneously and follow up by phone. We have not engaged a placement agent because we want to save the fee. Our anchor LP target is CalPERS, and we believe their commitment will bring credibility. We plan to hold a single close at our target of $150M. Our terms are 2.5% management fee and 25% carry with no hurdle rate, consistent with our confidence in our strategy."

Identify at least **four problems** with this approach and recommend specific improvements for each.

---

### Question 3: Governance Conflict Assessment (6 points)

Consider the following scenario:

> Blackthorn Capital manages Fund II (in harvest period, Year 7) and Fund III (in investment period, Year 2). A portfolio company in Fund II requires a $15M follow-on investment to fund an acquisition that would significantly increase its value. Fund II's reserves are depleted. The GP proposes that Fund III make the $15M investment in the Fund II portfolio company, arguing it is a compelling standalone opportunity for Fund III.

a) Identify the specific conflicts of interest present in this situation. (2 points)

b) What governance procedures should the GP follow before proceeding? (2 points)

c) What terms and conditions should be required to protect Fund III LPs? (2 points)

## Section 4: Mini-Case: Launching a Fund (20 points)

### Background

**Sarah Chen** has spent 14 years in private equity — 6 years as an associate and VP at Warburg Pincus, followed by 8 years at Crescent Capital Partners, a $2B AUM mid-market PE firm, where she rose to Managing Director. At Crescent, Sarah led or co-led 12 investments in healthcare services and technology-enabled services, of which 7 have been fully realized. Her personal track record on realized deals shows a gross MOIC of 2.8x and a gross IRR of 32%.

Sarah has decided to spin out and launch her own firm, **Keystone Equity Partners**, focusing exclusively on healthcare services buyouts in the lower middle-market.

### Proposed Fund Details

| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Fund Name** | Keystone Healthcare Partners Fund I, LP |
| **Target Size** | $250M (hard cap: $300M) |
| **Strategy** | Control buyouts of healthcare services businesses |
| **Target Companies** | $15M-$50M revenue; $3M-$10M EBITDA |
| **Geography** | United States |
| **Target Deal Size** | $15M-$40M equity per deal |
| **Portfolio Construction** | 8-12 investments over a 4-year investment period |
| **GP Commitment** | 2% ($5M) |
| **Management Fee** | 2.0% on committed capital (Years 1-5); 1.5% on invested capital (Years 6-10) |
| **Carried Interest** | 20% over 8% preferred return |
| **Waterfall** | European (whole-fund) |
| **Key Person** | Sarah Chen and one additional hire (yet to be identified) |
| **Fund Term** | 10 years + two 1-year extensions |

### Target LP Base

Sarah has identified the following prospective LPs:

| LP Category | Target Allocation | Estimated Timeline |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Former Crescent LPs (personal relationships) | $50M | 3-6 months |
| Regional pension funds | $40M | 9-15 months |
| Healthcare-focused family offices | $60M | 4-8 months |
| Fund-of-funds / emerging manager programs | $50M | 6-12 months |
| High-net-worth individuals | $30M | 3-6 months |
| Anchor / seed investor (dedicated program) | $25M | 4-8 months |
| **Total Target** | **$255M** | |

### Additional Context

- Sarah has a verbal commitment from one Crescent LP (a family office) for $15M, contingent on final terms
- She plans to hire a second senior partner from outside Crescent within 6 months of launch
- Crescent Capital has agreed to a clean separation with no non-compete, but Sarah cannot solicit Crescent's existing portfolio company management teams
- Sarah has identified 3 proprietary deal opportunities she could pursue immediately with a first close of $75M
- She has retained a boutique fund formation attorney and is in discussions with two fund administrators

---

### Questions

Answer each question in 3-5 sentences. Each sub-question is worth 4 points.

**a) Strategy Critique:** Evaluate Sarah's fund strategy. What are its two greatest strengths and two most significant risks? How should she address the risks?

**b) Legal Structure Recommendation:** Sarah is debating between relying on a 3(c)(1) exemption versus a 3(c)(7) exemption. Given her target LP base and fund size, which exemption should she choose and why? What are the trade-offs?

**c) Fundraising Plan Assessment:** Evaluate her target LP pipeline. Is the $255M target realistic for a first close of $75M and a final close near $250M? Identify the single biggest gap in her fundraising plan and recommend how to address it.

**d) Governance Framework:** Design the key governance provisions Sarah should include in her LPA. Specifically address: key person provisions, LPAC composition, conflict of interest policies, and concentration limits.

**e) Fund II Projection:** Assuming Fund I launches successfully and Sarah deploys capital over 4 years, sketch out the conditions and timeline under which she should begin raising Fund II. What metrics and milestones would LPs expect to see?

## Answer Key

### Section 1: Knowledge Check (40 points)

| Q | Answer | Q | Answer |
|---|--------|---|--------|
| 1 | B | 11 | B |
| 2 | B | 12 | C |
| 3 | B | 13 | B |
| 4 | B | 14 | B |
| 5 | B | 15 | B |
| 6 | C | 16 | B |
| 7 | B | 17 | B |
| 8 | B | 18 | B |
| 9 | B | 19 | B |
| 10 | C | 20 | B |

**Detailed Explanations:**

1. **B — Market sounding before finalizing terms.** Strategy validation requires testing the thesis with potential LPs before committing legal and operational resources. This feedback loop helps calibrate fund size, terms, and positioning. Launching without validation risks months of fundraising with a flawed strategy.

2. **B — 3(c)(7) fund.** Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act exempts funds from registration if all investors are "qualified purchasers" (generally $5M+ in investments for individuals). Unlike 3(c)(1), which caps beneficial owners at 100, 3(c)(7) allows an unlimited number of qualified purchasers.

3. **B — $50-150M is realistic for an emerging manager.** Fund I sizing should be driven by deployable deal flow, realistic LP base, and operational capacity. Oversizing creates deployment pressure and underperformance risk. Undersizing may not cover operating costs through management fees.

4. **B — Promising higher returns.** Return projections are not a credible differentiator — every fund promises strong returns. Differentiation comes from structural advantages: proprietary sourcing, sector expertise, geographic focus, or operational capabilities that competitors cannot easily replicate.

5. **B — Investment period suspension.** The key person clause protects LPs by halting new investments if specified critical individuals leave or reduce involvement. The GP must obtain LP consent (often via LPAC or LP vote) to resume investing, or the investment period may be permanently terminated.

6. **C — Guaranteed return projections.** A PPM is a disclosure document, not a marketing guarantee. Securities regulations prohibit guaranteeing returns. The PPM includes strategy descriptions, risk factors, team bios, terms, and conflict disclosures — but never guaranteed outcomes.

7. **B — 3(c)(1), up to 100 beneficial owners.** With 105 total investors but not all qualifying as "qualified purchasers," the fund cannot use 3(c)(7). The 3(c)(1) exemption permits up to 100 beneficial owners. The GP would need to reduce the investor count to 100 or fewer, or convert some investors to qualified purchasers for a 3(c)(7) structure. (Note: The question states 90 + 15 = 105, exceeding the 100-person limit for 3(c)(1) — this is a trick question. The best available answer is B because the fund should restructure to stay within the 100-person limit, potentially by grouping related investors or using feeder structures.)

8. **B — Favorable fee arrangements, MFN, reporting, and co-investment.** Side letters are bilateral agreements granting specific LPs preferential terms. Most-favored-nation (MFN) clauses ensure an LP receives terms at least as favorable as any other LP. Side letters do not typically modify the fund's investment strategy (that is governed by the LPA for all LPs).

9. **B — Prospect > Meeting > DD > Commitment.** The fundraising pipeline follows a logical progression: identify targets, secure introductory meetings, advance interested LPs through their due diligence process, and ultimately receive signed subscription agreements.

10. **C — 12-18 months.** Institutional LP due diligence cycles are lengthy. Pension funds and endowments require investment committee approvals, consultant reviews, and legal negotiations. A first-time fund should budget 12-18 months and potentially longer.

11. **B — Strategy, track record, team, operations, legal, and risk management.** The DDQ is a comprehensive questionnaire covering all aspects of the GP's investment program. Institutional LPs use standardized DDQs (often based on ILPA templates) to evaluate managers systematically.

12. **C — HNWIs and family offices.** High-net-worth individuals and family offices have shorter decision-making cycles, fewer governance hurdles, and more flexibility on terms compared to institutional investors. They are often the backbone of Fund I raises for emerging managers.

13. **B — Initial LP group accepted, operations begin.** First close establishes the fund as a legal and operational entity. The GP can begin deploying capital, while continuing to raise additional commitments through subsequent closes up to the hard cap.

14. **B — Pro-rata share plus interest for equalization.** Equalization ensures that LPs joining at subsequent closes are in the same economic position as first-close LPs. The new LP pays their share of capital already called plus an interest charge (typically at the preferred return rate), which is distributed to existing LPs.

15. **B — 10-15 business days' notice.** LPA provisions typically require 10-15 business days' advance notice for capital calls, specifying the amount due, purpose of the call (investment, fees, expenses), wire instructions, and payment deadline. This gives LPs time to arrange liquidity.

16. **B — Reviewing conflicts, valuations, and extensions.** The LPAC serves an oversight role, not a decision-making role. It reviews matters where the GP has conflicts of interest, approves related-party transactions, reviews valuation methodologies, and consents to fund term extensions.

17. **B — Follow allocation policy and disclose to LPAC.** Cross-fund allocation is a common conflict requiring a transparent, pre-disclosed allocation policy. The GP should follow the policy documented in the LPAs (typically allocating to the fund in its active investment period), document the rationale, and report the allocation to the LPAC.

18. **B — 15-25% max per company, 8-15 investments.** Portfolio concentration limits protect against catastrophic loss from any single investment. Industry standard for buyout funds is a maximum of 15-25% of committed capital in any single deal, with total portfolio construction targeting 8-15 investments for adequate diversification.

19. **B — After Fund I is deployed with early proof points.** LPs expect to see meaningful deployment (60-80%+ of Fund I committed capital), early exits or strong markups on unrealized deals, and a proven team before committing to Fund II. Starting the fundraise too early signals desperation; waiting until full exit forfeits timing advantages.

20. **B — Aggregate fund-level returns.** The European (whole-fund) waterfall calculates carried interest only after all invested capital and the preferred return have been returned to LPs across the entire fund. This is more LP-friendly than the American (deal-by-deal) waterfall, which allows carry on individual profitable deals even if the overall fund is below the hurdle.

### Section 2: Fund Economics Calculator (20 points)

#### Problem 1: GP Economics Model (8 points)

**a) Total Management Fees (3 points):**

*Investment Period (Years 1-5):* Fee based on committed capital.

| Year | Fee Base (Committed Capital) | Fee Rate | Annual Fee |
|------|------------------------------|----------|------------|
| 1 | $300M | 2.0% | $6.0M |
| 2 | $300M | 2.0% | $6.0M |
| 3 | $300M | 2.0% | $6.0M |
| 4 | $300M | 2.0% | $6.0M |
| 5 | $300M | 2.0% | $6.0M |
| **Subtotal** | | | **$30.0M** |

*Harvest Period (Years 6-10):* Fee based on invested capital net of realized exits (at cost).

| Year | Invested Capital | Cumulative Exits (Cost) | Net Invested Capital | Fee Rate | Annual Fee |
|------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------|------------|
| 6 | $285M | $30M | $255M | 1.5% | $3.825M |
| 7 | $285M | $80M | $205M | 1.5% | $3.075M |
| 8 | $285M | $160M | $125M | 1.5% | $1.875M |
| 9 | $285M | $230M | $55M | 1.5% | $0.825M |
| 10 | $285M | $285M | $0M | 1.5% | $0.000M |
| **Subtotal** | | | | | **$9.600M** |

**Total Management Fees (10-year life): $30.0M + $9.6M = $39.6M**

**b) GP Break-Even Year (2 points):**

| Year | Cumulative Mgmt Fees | Cumulative Operating Costs | Net Position |
|------|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | $6.0M | $4.5M | +$1.5M |
| 2 | $12.0M | $9.0M | +$3.0M |

**The GP breaks even in Year 1.** Cumulative management fee revenue ($6.0M) exceeds cumulative operating costs ($4.5M) from the very first year. This illustrates why fund sizing is critical — a $300M fund at 2% generates $6.0M annually, sufficient to cover a lean operation from inception.

Note: If the question is interpreted as the year in which the GP has built a meaningful cumulative surplus sufficient to cover startup costs (legal formation costs of ~$500K-$1M, pre-fundraising expenses), the answer remains Year 1, as the $1.5M surplus covers typical formation costs.

**c) Carried Interest Calculation (3 points):**

Total invested capital: $285M
Gross MOIC: 2.5x
Total fund value at exit: $285M x 2.5 = $712.5M

Total profit: $712.5M - $285M = $427.5M

Preferred return (8% compounded over an assumed weighted-average hold period):
- Using an approximate weighted average hold of 6 years for the blended portfolio:
- Preferred return owed = $285M x [(1.08)^6 - 1] = $285M x 0.5869 = $167.3M

Profits above preferred return: $427.5M - $167.3M = $260.2M

GP catch-up (100% to GP until GP has 20% of total profits):
- 20% of total profits = 0.20 x $427.5M = $85.5M
- Catch-up amount: The GP receives 100% of distributions after the preferred return until the GP has received $85.5M. Since $85.5M < $260.2M, the catch-up is fully satisfied.

Remaining profits after catch-up: $260.2M - $85.5M = $174.7M
GP share of remaining (20%): $174.7M x 0.20 = $34.9M

**Total GP Carried Interest: $85.5M + $34.9M = $120.4M**

Verification: GP carry as % of total profit = $120.4M / $427.5M = 28.2%. After full catch-up and 80/20 split on remaining profits, the GP's effective share converges toward 20% of all profits above zero (not just above the pref), which checks out: 20% x $427.5M = $85.5M for the catch-up target. Total GP carry = 20% x total profits above the pref (through the catch-up and split mechanism) = approximately 20% of $427.5M = $85.5M...

Simplified check: With a European waterfall and full catch-up, the GP ultimately receives 20% of all profits above the preferred return threshold, but the catch-up mechanism ensures the GP gets 20% of ALL profits (including the preferred return band). So:

**Simplified: Total GP Carry = 20% x Total Profit = 20% x $427.5M = $85.5M**

The catch-up mechanism means the GP receives 20% of total profits once fully caught up. **Total Carried Interest: $85.5M.**

#### Problem 2: Waterfall Calculation (7 points)

**Given:**
- Committed capital: $200M; Invested capital: $190M
- GP commitment: $4M (2%); LP capital: $186M (98%)
- Total distributions: $475M
- Preferred return: 8% compounded annually over 6 years
- Waterfall: European with 100% catch-up

**Step 1 — Return of Contributed Capital (1 point):**

Return all contributed capital to partners in proportion to their commitments:
- LP return of capital: $186M
- GP return of capital: $4M
- **Total Step 1: $190M**

Remaining to distribute: $475M - $190M = $285M

**Step 2 — Preferred Return (2 points):**

Preferred return = 8% compounded annually for 6 years on contributed capital:
- Preferred return factor: (1.08)^6 - 1 = 1.5869 - 1 = 0.5869
- LP preferred return: $186M x 0.5869 = $109.2M
- GP preferred return: $4M x 0.5869 = $2.3M
- **Total Step 2: $111.5M**

Remaining to distribute: $285M - $111.5M = $173.5M

**Step 3 — GP Catch-Up (2 points):**

Total profits = $285M (distributions above contributed capital)
GP target = 20% of total profits = 20% x $285M = $57.0M
GP has received from Step 2: $2.3M (its own preferred return on GP commitment)
Catch-up needed: $57.0M - $2.3M = $54.7M
100% catch-up: GP receives 100% of next distributions until caught up.

- **GP catch-up: $54.7M**

Remaining to distribute: $173.5M - $54.7M = $118.8M

**Step 4 — 80/20 Split (1 point):**

- LP share (80%): $118.8M x 0.80 = $95.0M
- GP share (20%): $118.8M x 0.20 = $23.8M

**Summary (1 point):**

| Component | LP | GP | Total |
|-----------|----|----|-------|
| Return of Capital | $186.0M | $4.0M | $190.0M |
| Preferred Return | $109.2M | $2.3M | $111.5M |
| GP Catch-Up | $0.0M | $54.7M | $54.7M |
| 80/20 Split | $95.0M | $23.8M | $118.8M |
| **Total** | **$390.2M** | **$84.8M** | **$475.0M** |

**Verification:**
- LP net MOIC: $390.2M / $186M = 2.10x
- GP carry (excluding GP capital return and pref): $54.7M + $23.8M = $78.5M
- GP carry as % of total fund profit: $78.5M / $285M = 27.5% (approaches 20% of total profit inclusive of the pref pass-through to GP on their commitment, which is expected with full catch-up mechanics)
- Total check: $390.2M + $84.8M = $475.0M (confirmed)

#### Problem 3: Fund II Sizing (5 points)

**a) Target Average Deal Size (1 point):**

Fund I average deal size: $285M / 10 = $28.5M
Fund II target: 40% larger = $28.5M x 1.40 = **$39.9M (approximately $40M)**

**b) Target Fund II Size (1 point):**

12 deals x $40M = **$480M target fund size**

Note: This represents capital for investments only. Including management fees and expenses (~5-6% of committed capital), the committed capital target would be approximately $510M. For simplicity, we use $480M as the investment-driven target.

**c) Expected Re-Up Capital (1 point):**

Fund I LP capital: $291M (total $300M less $9M GP commitment)
Re-up rate: 70%
Expected re-up: $291M x 0.70 = **$203.7M**

**d) Required New LP Capital (1 point):**

Target: $480M
GP commitment (assume 2-3%): ~$12M
Required from LPs: $480M - $12M = $468M
Less re-up capital: $468M - $203.7M = **$264.3M in new LP capital required**

**e) Realism Assessment (1 point):**

The target fund size of $480M represents a **60% step-up** from Fund I ($300M), which is aggressive but within market norms for a strong-performing Fund I (typical step-ups are 50-100% for top-performing managers). However, the LP math reveals a challenge: over 56% of total LP capital ($264.3M of $468M) must come from new LPs. This requires a significant expansion of the LP base and likely necessitates engagement with larger institutional investors (pensions, endowments) who were not in Fund I. The fundraise is achievable but will require a placement agent, a longer timeline (18-24 months), and demonstrated top-quartile performance in Fund I. A more conservative target of $400-450M might be more realistic for Fund II.

### Section 3: Fund Strategy Analysis (20 points)

#### Question 1: Strategy Evaluation (7 points)

**Strengths (1 point each, max 3 points):**

1. **Meaningful fund size ($500M) suggests ambition and ability to attract institutional LPs.** A $500M growth equity fund is within market norms and would generate $10M in annual management fees, sufficient to build a quality team and infrastructure.

2. **Banking network provides deal flow access.** Former investment bankers have relationships with company management teams, intermediaries, and other sponsors — a genuine sourcing advantage if leveraged correctly.

3. **Growth equity strategy has favorable tailwinds.** The growth equity asset class has grown significantly, with LP demand for strategies between venture and buyout. Targeting this segment is timely.

**Weaknesses and Improvements (1.33 points each, max 4 points):**

1. **Lack of focus — too many sectors and geographies.** Covering five sectors across three continents is impossibly broad for a first-time fund. No LP will believe a two-person team can source, diligence, and manage deals across technology, healthcare, consumer, industrial, and financial services globally. **Improvement:** Narrow to 1-2 sectors where the team has demonstrable operating or investing expertise, and focus on a single geography (e.g., North American technology).

2. **No relevant operating or investing track record.** Eight years of investment banking experience does not constitute a private equity track record. Bankers advise on transactions; they do not invest in, govern, or create value in portfolio companies. **Improvement:** Recruit a partner with direct PE or growth equity investing experience and an attributable track record. Alternatively, start with a smaller fund ($100-150M) and build a track record.

3. **Revenue range too wide ($5M-$500M).** This 100x range suggests no clear target profile. A $5M revenue company requires a fundamentally different sourcing, diligence, and value creation approach than a $500M revenue company. **Improvement:** Define a specific revenue band (e.g., $20-100M) consistent with check sizes and team capacity.

4. **"Superior analytical ability" is not differentiation.** Every fund claims analytical superiority. Differentiation must be structural and verifiable — proprietary sourcing, operating expertise, platform strategy, or sector-specific knowledge. **Improvement:** Articulate a concrete, repeatable sourcing or value creation edge that competitors cannot replicate.

---

#### Question 2: Fundraising Approach Assessment (7 points)

**Problems and Improvements (1.75 points each):**

1. **Unrealistic timeline (4 months).** Institutional LP due diligence cycles alone take 3-6 months. A Fund I raise typically takes 12-18 months. **Improvement:** Budget 12-18 months for the full fundraise. Set a realistic first-close target at 6-9 months with a smaller subset of faster-moving LPs (family offices, HNWIs, emerging manager programs).

2. **Mass email approach is ineffective and potentially non-compliant.** Sending a 400-page PPM to 500 LPs simultaneously is spam, not fundraising. It demonstrates no LP targeting or relationship building. It may also raise regulatory concerns around general solicitation. **Improvement:** Build a targeted list of 50-75 relevant LPs segmented by type (family offices, emerging manager programs, fund-of-funds). Develop warm introductions through consultants, attorneys, and personal networks. Send a concise teaser or executive summary first, followed by meetings, with the full PPM shared only during formal DD.

3. **Targeting CalPERS as anchor is unrealistic.** CalPERS manages $450B+ and typically makes $100M+ commitments to established managers. They do not anchor Fund I raises for unknown GPs. **Improvement:** Target realistic anchor investors: emerging manager programs (e.g., NYCRS, Illinois Teachers), family offices, or dedicated seed/anchor platforms (like Blackstone's Strategic Capital Holdings) that specialize in backing first-time funds.

4. **Above-market terms with no track record.** A 2.5% management fee and 25% carry with no hurdle rate are premium terms that only the most established GPs command. An emerging manager with no track record demanding above-market terms will be immediately dismissed by institutional LPs. **Improvement:** Offer market or below-market terms for Fund I: 1.5-2.0% management fee, 20% carry over an 8% preferred return. Consider a fee break at first close to reward early LPs. Demonstrate alignment through a meaningful GP commitment (3%+).

5. **Single close strategy is risky.** Requiring $150M at a single close provides no flexibility. If the GP falls short, the entire raise fails. **Improvement:** Plan for multiple closes — a first close at $50-75M (one-third of target), followed by subsequent closes over 12 months. This creates momentum and allows early LPs to validate the fund for later investors.

#### Question 3: Governance Conflict Assessment (6 points)

**a) Conflicts of Interest (2 points):**

- **Cross-fund conflict:** The GP has a fiduciary duty to both Fund II and Fund III LPs. Using Fund III capital to rescue a Fund II investment creates a direct conflict — the GP is incentivized to protect Fund II's returns (and its own carry in Fund II) at the potential expense of Fund III.
- **Valuation conflict:** The GP sets the price at which Fund III invests. If the Fund II portfolio company is marked at an inflated value, Fund III overpays and Fund II benefits from an artificially high exit/valuation. The GP has incentive to set a favorable transfer price.
- **Investment merit conflict:** The GP must honestly assess whether this is a genuinely compelling standalone investment for Fund III or primarily a bailout of a struggling Fund II position.

**b) Required Governance Procedures (2 points):**

- **LPAC approval from both funds:** The GP must present the proposed transaction to the LPACs of both Fund II and Fund III, fully disclosing the conflict. Both LPACs should consent before the transaction proceeds.
- **Independent valuation:** Engage a third-party valuation firm to establish a fair market price for the investment, ensuring Fund III is not overpaying.
- **Written disclosure and documentation:** Provide detailed written disclosure to all LPs in both funds describing the transaction, the conflict, the rationale, and the safeguards in place. Document that the investment independently meets Fund III's investment criteria.
- **Recusal consideration:** Consider whether conflicted GP personnel should recuse themselves from the Fund III investment committee vote on this specific transaction.

**c) Protective Terms for Fund III LPs (2 points):**

- **Arm's-length pricing:** The investment must be made at a price validated by independent third-party valuation — not the GP's internal marks.
- **Standalone investment merit:** The GP must demonstrate that the investment meets Fund III's stated strategy, return targets, and concentration limits as a standalone opportunity, independent of any benefit to Fund II.
- **Priority return or structural protection:** Fund III should receive senior security or preferred equity in the portfolio company, ensuring Fund III's capital is protected ahead of Fund II's existing equity position.
- **Co-investment or syndication alternative:** Before using Fund III capital, explore whether third-party co-investors or other sources of capital are available, reducing the conflict.
- **LPAC monitoring:** The Fund III LPAC should receive enhanced reporting on this investment going forward, with explicit updates on performance relative to Fund III's underwriting assumptions.

### Section 4: Mini-Case Answers (20 points)

**a) Strategy Critique (4 points):**

**Strengths:**
1. **Deep sector expertise with an attributable track record.** Sarah's 14 years of PE experience with 12 deals led/co-led and 7 realized at 2.8x gross MOIC / 32% gross IRR represents a strong, verifiable track record in healthcare services — her chosen focus area. LPs can diligence these deals with references.
2. **Focused strategy with a clear niche.** Lower middle-market healthcare services buyouts is a well-defined, defensible strategy with structural tailwinds (aging demographics, fragmentation, regulatory complexity creating barriers to entry for generalist funds). The focus allows credible differentiation.

**Risks:**
1. **Key person concentration.** Sarah is currently the sole investment professional. The second partner has not yet been identified. If Sarah were unable to serve, the fund has no continuity. **Mitigation:** Accelerate the senior hire — ideally before the first close. Make it a condition of the first close, or at minimum identify and introduce the candidate to LPs during fundraising to build confidence.
2. **Institutional infrastructure risk.** Spinning out from a large platform means Sarah must simultaneously build a firm (operations, compliance, back office) while fundraising and deploying capital. Crescent's infrastructure will not follow her. **Mitigation:** Outsource non-core functions (fund administration, CFO services, compliance) to experienced third-party providers. Hire a COO/CFO with fund operations experience within the first 6 months.

**b) Legal Structure Recommendation (4 points):**

Sarah should choose the **3(c)(7) exemption**. Her target fund size ($250M) and LP base include institutional investors (pension funds, fund-of-funds, family offices) who are almost certainly qualified purchasers. The 3(c)(7) exemption allows unlimited qualified purchasers, giving her flexibility to add LPs at subsequent closes without bumping against the 100-investor cap of 3(c)(1).

The **trade-off** is that all investors must be qualified purchasers ($5M+ in investments for individuals), which may exclude some smaller HNWIs. However, given her $250M target, the minimum check size will likely be $2-5M, which effectively filters for qualified purchasers anyway. If she wants to include a small number of non-qualified-purchaser individuals (e.g., former colleagues investing $250K-$500K), she could use a parallel vehicle or feeder fund structured under 3(c)(1) for those investors.

She should also register as an Exempt Reporting Adviser (ERA) with the SEC, given fund assets will be under $150M at launch (crossing the registration threshold as AUM grows requires filing Form ADV within 90 days).

**c) Fundraising Plan Assessment (4 points):**

The $255M target is **realistic but tight**, with meaningful execution risk. For a first close of $75M, the most likely sources are: the confirmed family office ($15M), additional former Crescent LPs ($35M), and early family office / HNW commitments ($25M). This is achievable in 4-6 months.

The **single biggest gap** is the absence of a placement agent or dedicated capital introduction resource. Sarah is a deal professional, not a fundraiser. Managing a 100+ LP pipeline while also building a firm and evaluating deals is extremely difficult for a solo GP. **Recommendation:** Engage a boutique placement agent specializing in emerging managers (e.g., Park Hill, Monument Group, or a smaller specialist). The 2% placement fee on capital raised is well worth the access to institutional LP relationships, process management, and credibility it provides. Alternatively, if cost is a concern, engage a capital introduction consultant on a project basis for the institutional LP segment (pensions, fund-of-funds) while Sarah personally manages family offices and HNWIs.

Additional consideration: The regional pension fund allocation ($40M) is the most uncertain — these LPs have 12-18 month diligence cycles and may not commit to a Fund I without consultant approval. Sarah should not count on this capital for first or even second close planning.

**d) Governance Framework (4 points):**

- **Key Person Provision:** Sarah Chen and the second senior hire (once identified) should be designated as key persons. If either ceases to devote substantially all of their business time to the fund, the investment period is automatically suspended. Resumption requires consent of a majority-in-interest of LPs (not just the LPAC). A 90-day cure period should apply to allow for hiring a replacement.

- **LPAC Composition:** 3-5 members representing the largest LP commitments across different LP categories (e.g., one family office, one pension, one fund-of-funds). The LPAC should meet at least semi-annually and have approval rights over: conflicts of interest, co-investment allocations, related-party transactions, valuation methodology changes, and fund extensions.

- **Conflict of Interest Policies:** As an emerging manager, Sarah should adopt strict conflict policies: (i) no personal investments in deals reviewed by the fund without LPAC approval, (ii) full disclosure of any relationship between the GP and portfolio company management, (iii) pre-clearance of any GP-affiliate transactions, (iv) prohibition on cross-fund transactions without LPAC consent and independent valuation (relevant when Fund II is eventually raised).

- **Concentration Limits:** Maximum 20% of committed capital ($50M) in any single investment. Maximum 30% in any single sub-sector within healthcare services. Minimum of 8 portfolio companies to ensure diversification. These limits protect LPs from excessive risk concentration in a Fund I with an unproven platform.

**e) Fund II Projection (4 points):**

Sarah should begin Fund II fundraising approximately **3.5-4 years after Fund I's first close**, targeting a first close for Fund II around Year 4.5-5 of Fund I. At that point, LPs would expect to see:

- **Deployment progress:** 75-100% of Fund I capital deployed (8-10 deals completed out of targeted 8-12)
- **Early performance signals:** At least 1-2 full realizations demonstrating the strategy works, with the remainder of the portfolio showing positive unrealized markups. A gross MOIC of 1.5-2.0x on deployed capital (blended realized and unrealized) would position her well.
- **Team development:** The second partner should be fully integrated and independently leading deals. Ideally, the team has grown to 4-6 investment professionals, demonstrating institutional scaling.
- **Operational maturity:** Clean audit opinions, robust LP reporting track record (4+ years of quarterly reports), no material compliance issues, and strong LP references.
- **Fund II sizing:** A target of $400-500M (1.5-2.0x step-up) is achievable if Fund I is top-quartile. If Fund I performance is second-quartile, a more modest step-up to $350-400M is appropriate.

The critical milestone is having enough realized or near-realized performance data that LPs can underwrite Fund I returns with confidence — unrealized markups alone are insufficient for most institutional investors making a Fund II commitment.
