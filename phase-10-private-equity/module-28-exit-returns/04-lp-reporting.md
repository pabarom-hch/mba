# Lesson 4: LP Reporting & Fund Performance

> Communicating fund performance and managing LP relationships

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Calculate and interpret fund-level performance metrics (DPI, TVPI, RVPI)
- Prepare comprehensive quarterly LP reports
- Explain the J-curve phenomenon and its implications
- Benchmark fund performance against peers
- Manage LP communication and relationships

---

## Introduction

Limited Partners (LPs) entrust capital to PE funds and expect transparent, accurate reporting on performance. Fund-level metrics differ from deal-level returns because they account for timing, fees, and the full portfolio. This lesson covers the key metrics, reporting standards, and communication practices that define LP relationships.

Understanding LP reporting is essential for PE professionals managing investor relationships and for corporate executives evaluating PE fund track records.

## Core Concepts

### Fund-Level Performance Metrics

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  FUND PERFORMANCE METRICS                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│  DPI (Distributions to Paid-In)                             │
│  ─────────────────────────────                              │
│  Formula: Cumulative Distributions / Paid-In Capital        │
│  Measures: Cash returned to LPs ("cash-on-cash")            │
│  Example: $150M distributed / $200M paid-in = 0.75x DPI     │
│                                                              │
│  RVPI (Residual Value to Paid-In)                           │
│  ─────────────────────────────────                          │
│  Formula: NAV of Remaining Investments / Paid-In Capital    │
│  Measures: Unrealized value ("paper gains")                 │
│  Example: $180M NAV / $200M paid-in = 0.90x RVPI           │
│                                                              │
│  TVPI (Total Value to Paid-In)                              │
│  ───────────────────────────                                │
│  Formula: DPI + RVPI                                        │
│  Measures: Total value created                              │
│  Example: 0.75x + 0.90x = 1.65x TVPI                        │
│                                                              │

### Gross vs. Net Returns

| Metric | Definition | Relationship |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Gross IRR** | Returns before fees and carry | Raw investment performance |
| **Net IRR** | Returns after fees and carry | What LPs actually receive |
| **Gross MOIC** | Multiple before fees | Deal-level performance |
| **Net MOIC** | Multiple after fees | LP-level returns |

**Typical Fee Impact:**

```
GROSS TO NET CONVERSION (EXAMPLE)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Gross IRR:     25%
Less: Mgmt fee drag:    -3%
Less: Carry (20% of profits): -4%
─────────────────────────────────
Net IRR:       18%

Gross MOIC:    2.5x
Less: Mgmt fees (over life): -0.15x
Less: Carry (20% above 1x):  -0.27x
─────────────────────────────────
Net MOIC:      2.08x
```

                          Fund Year

Key Drivers of J-Curve:
• Management fees charged on committed capital
• Investments held at cost initially
• Realizations typically begin Year 3-4
• Performance improves as exits occur
```

### J-Curve Phases

| Phase | Years | Characteristics |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Investment Period** | 1-3 | Capital deployed, fees drag, negative IRR |
| **Value Creation** | 3-5 | Operational improvement, some exits |
| **Harvest Period** | 5-7 | Majority of exits, strong returns |
| **Tail End** | 7-10 | Final exits, extension if needed |

### J-Curve Implications

| Stakeholder | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| **LPs** | Don't judge fund on early years; DPI <1x normal in Years 1-4 |
| **GPs** | Set expectations appropriately; manage capital calls |
| **Consultants** | Compare funds at similar stage in lifecycle |

## PE Application

### Valuation Best Practices

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Fair value** | Mark-to-market based on exit assumptions |
| **Consistency** | Same methodology across portfolio |
| **Documentation** | Clear support for valuations |
| **Third-party** | Annual independent valuation |
| **Conservatism** | Prudent assumptions, avoid overstatement |

### LP Relationship Management

| Activity | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Regular touchpoints** | Build trust, gather feedback |
| **Co-investment offers** | Deepen relationship, reduce fees |
| **Thought leadership** | Demonstrate expertise |
| **Reference checks** | Support re-up process |
| **Transparency** | Build long-term partnership |

---

## CEO Application

If you're a CEO of a PE-backed company:

**Your Role in LP Reporting:**

1. **Provide accurate data** - financials, KPIs, narratives
2. **Meet deadlines** - LP reports depend on timely info
3. **Participate in meetings** - present at annual meetings
4. **Support co-investors** - engage with co-invest LPs

**Understanding Fund Dynamics:**

| Fund Stage | Implication for You |
|------------|---------------------|
| Early fund | Longer potential hold, more support |
| Mid-fund | Balanced approach to timing |
| Late fund | Pressure for exits, timeline focus |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **DPI, TVPI, RVPI** - the trinity of fund-level metrics
2. **Gross vs. net** - fees and carry create significant difference
3. **J-curve is normal** - early negative returns expected
4. **Vintage matters** - compare funds at same lifecycle stage
5. **Transparency builds trust** - honest communication with LPs
6. **Consistency is key** - same methodology quarter to quarter
7. **Benchmarking provides context** - compare to relevant peers

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Fund Metrics Calculation
A fund has $400M committed capital, $360M paid-in, $120M distributed, and $380M NAV. Calculate DPI, RVPI, and TVPI. If the fund is in Year 4, how does this compare to typical benchmarks?

### Problem 2: Gross to Net Conversion
A fund has a gross IRR of 28% and gross MOIC of 2.8x over 5 years. Estimate the net IRR and net MOIC assuming 2% management fee and 20% carry over 8% preferred return.

### Problem 3: LP Communication
A portfolio company you expected to exit at 3.5x MOIC is now valued at 1.2x due to market conditions. Draft the key messages for the quarterly LP report addressing this situation.
