## Answer Key

### Section 1
1-C, 2-A, 3-B, 4-B, 5-B, 6-B, 7-C, 8-C, 9-B, 10-B, 11-B, 12-B, 13-B, 14-C, 15-B, 16-C, 17-B, 18-B, 19-B, 20-C

### Section 2 Rubric

**a) Exit Readiness Scorecard (6 points - 1 each):**
- Financial Performance: 5/5 (strong growth, margin expansion)
- Growth Profile: 4/5 (15% CAGR, solid momentum)
- Management Team: 4/5 (CFO somewhat new but capable)
- Customer Concentration: 4/5 (improved to 18%)
- Systems/Reporting: 5/5 (ERP complete)
- Market Conditions: 5/5 (favorable multiples, credit)

**b) Equity Value Calculation (5 points):**
- Low: $18M × 10x = $180M EV - $35M debt = $145M equity
- Mid: $18M × 11x = $198M EV - $35M debt = $163M equity
- High: $18M × 12x = $216M EV - $35M debt = $181M equity
- MOIC range: 3.2x - 4.0x on $45M invested

**c) Exit Now vs. Wait (8 points - 2 each):**

Exit Now:
- Market multiples favorable (11-12x)
- Comparable transactions at premium valuations
- Credit markets favorable for buyers
- Strong operational metrics achieved

Wait:
- New CFO only 8 months in
- Potential for further margin expansion
- Could further reduce customer concentration
- Growth momentum could justify higher exit

**d) Recommendation (6 points):**
- Recommend initiating exit process in 6 months
- Rationale: Allow CFO to complete full fiscal year, capture one more quarter of strong performance
- Market conditions favorable but should act before cycle turns
- Begin banker selection and data room preparation now

### Section 3 Rubric

**a) Returns Calculation (8 points):**

MOIC:
- Total distributions: $5M + ($240M - $25M) = $5M + $215M = $220M
- MOIC: $220M / $27M = 8.1x (4 points)

IRR:
- Year 0: -$27M
- Year 2: +$5M
- Year 5: +$215M
- IRR ≈ 47% (4 points)

**b) Value Creation Bridge (12 points - 3 each):**

Entry equity: $27M
Exit equity: $215M
Value created: $188M

Revenue Growth:
- Additional revenue: $100M - $60M = $40M
- At entry margin (15%): $6M EBITDA
- At entry multiple (8x): $48M EV contribution
- Less proportional debt: ~$30M
- Net contribution: ~$18M

Margin Expansion:
- Exit revenue at margin delta: $100M × (20% - 15%) = $5M
- At entry multiple (8x): $40M
- Net contribution: ~$40M

Multiple Expansion:
- Exit EBITDA at multiple delta: $20M × (12 - 8) = $80M
- Net contribution: ~$80M

Deleveraging:
- Debt reduction: $45M - $25M = $20M
- Plus cash flow retained
- Net contribution: ~$50M

**c) Operational vs. Market (5 points):**
- Operational (revenue + margin): $58M / $188M = 31%
- Market (multiple expansion): $80M / $188M = 43%
- Deleveraging: $50M / $188M = 26%
- Analysis: Multiple expansion was largest single driver

**d) Performance vs. Targets (5 points):**
- Target IRR: 25% → Actual: 47% → Significantly exceeded
- Target MOIC: 2.5x → Actual: 8.1x → Significantly exceeded
- This would be a "home run" investment for the fund

### Section 4 Rubric

**a) Fund Metrics (8 points):**

Total distributions: $35M
DPI: $35M / $640M = 0.05x (3 points)

Total NAV: $145M + $50M + $180M + $90M + $60M + $48M = $573M
RVPI: $573M / $640M = 0.90x (3 points)

TVPI: 0.05x + 0.90x = 0.95x (2 points)

**b) Executive Summary (10 points):**

Sample response:
"Fund VII closed Q4 2025 with TVPI of 0.95x and net IRR of [X]%, reflecting the typical J-curve pattern for a Year 4 fund. During the quarter, we completed a partial exit of Company Alpha, distributing $35M to LPs and realizing a [X]x MOIC on the exited portion.

Company Gamma continues to perform strongly and we are preparing for a potential exit process in 2026, with current valuation implying 1.8x MOIC. We also completed two new investments during 2025 (Echo and Foxtrot), deploying the remaining $100M of available capital.

The portfolio experienced one setback as Company Beta faced operational challenges following the loss of a key customer. We are actively working with management on a remediation plan.

Overall, the portfolio has 4 of 6 investments performing at or above plan. With favorable M&A markets expected in 2026, we anticipate significant distribution activity over the next 12-18 months."

**c) Beta Write-Down Communication (7 points):**

Key talking points:
- Acknowledge the issue directly (2 points)
- Explain root cause (customer loss, competitive dynamics) (2 points)
- Describe remediation actions (management changes, cost reduction, new customer pipeline) (2 points)
- Provide realistic outlook (1 point)

Sample language:
"Company Beta experienced a significant setback in Q4 with the loss of its second-largest customer, representing approximately 15% of revenue. This triggered a reassessment of our investment thesis and a mark-down to $50M NAV from $95M.

We have taken immediate action: the CEO has been replaced, we are implementing a 20% cost reduction plan, and we have identified several potential new customer opportunities. While the investment outlook has materially changed, we believe there is a path to recovery over 18-24 months.

We will provide a detailed update at the annual meeting in March."
