|------|----------|---------|
| 1-4 | Banker selection | Selected middle-market bank |
| 5-8 | Preparation | CIM completed, data room 80% ready |
| 9-10 | Teaser distribution | 75 buyers contacted |

| 13-14 | IOI deadline | 12 IOIs received |
| 15-16 | Management meetings | 8 buyers met management |
| 17-18 | Final bids (LOI) | 5 LOIs received |
| 19 | LOI selection | Selected strategic at 11x |
| 20-26 | Due diligence | Completed with minor adjustments |
| 27-28 | Close | $275M EV, 11x EBITDA |

**IOI Summary:**

| Buyer | Type | EV Range | Multiple |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| A | Strategic | $260-280M | 10.4-11.2x |
| B | PE | $240-260M | 9.6-10.4x |

## PE Application

### Process Management Best Practices

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Maintain tension** | Keep multiple buyers engaged through LOI |
| **Control information** | Staged data room access |
| **Manage timing** | Synchronized deadlines create urgency |
| **Leverage banker** | Let them deliver tough messages |
| **Stay flexible** | Adapt process to buyer dynamics |

### Common Process Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Early exclusivity | Lost leverage | Resist until clear winner |
| Over-promising | Retrade risk | Conservative projections |
| Management fatigue | Poor meetings | Limit to 8-10 meetings |
| Information leaks | Market damage | Tight NDA, limited access |
| Single buyer focus | Weak negotiation | Maintain alternatives |

---

## CEO Application

If you're a CEO managing through a sale process:

**Your Role in the Process:**

1. **Lead management meetings** - you are the face of the company
2. **Maintain business performance** - don't let process distract operations
3. **Keep team focused** - manage internal communication carefully
4. **Support due diligence** - rapid, accurate responses
5. **Negotiate your role** - address your future early

**Managing Confidentiality:**

| Stakeholder | Communication |
|-------------|---------------|
| Senior team | Need-to-know basis, NDA |
| Employees | After signing or close |
| Customers | Only if deal requires |
| Suppliers | At or after close |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Process creates value** - competitive tension adds 10-20% to price
2. **Preparation is critical** - CIM, data room, management prep before launch
3. **Banker selection matters** - sector expertise and buyer relationships key
4. **Data room quality** - well-organized data room reduces DD friction
5. **Management meetings sell** - invest heavily in preparation
6. **Maintain optionality** - keep multiple buyers engaged through LOI
7. **Control the timeline** - synchronized deadlines create urgency

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Process Design
You're selling a $40M EBITDA regional healthcare company. Design the sale process: buyer universe size, timeline, and key milestones. Consider strategic vs. financial buyers.

### Problem 2: IOI Evaluation
You receive 6 IOIs ranging from $180M to $220M EV. The highest bidder wants 30% rollover and 60-day exclusivity. The second highest ($210M) is all cash with 45-day exclusivity. How do you evaluate and respond?

### Problem 3: Management Meeting Prep
The CEO is nervous about buyer meetings. Design a preparation program including timeline, mock session structure, and common tough questions to practice.
