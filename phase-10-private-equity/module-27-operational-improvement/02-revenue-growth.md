## Introduction

Revenue growth is the most powerful value creation lever in PE. A dollar of revenue flows directly to enterprise value at the EBITDA margin multiplied by the exit multiple. For a company with 20% margins exiting at 10x, each dollar of revenue adds $2 of enterprise value. This lesson covers the systematic approaches PE firms use to accelerate revenue.

## Framework: Pricing Optimization

### Pricing Diagnostic

| Question | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| When was last price increase? | If >2 years, opportunity exists |
| How does pricing compare to market? | 10%+ gap is common |
| What's the pricing process? | Ad hoc = opportunity |
| Who owns pricing decisions? | Sales control = value leakage |
| Do contracts have escalators? | Missing escalators = margin erosion |

### Pricing Levers

```

   └── By competitive position

3. STRUCTURAL CHANGES
   ├── Add surcharges (fuel, materials)
   ├── Unbundle services
   ├── Introduce tiered pricing
   └── Contract escalator clauses

4. VALUE-BASED PRICING

## Worked Example: Distribution Company Revenue Acceleration

**Situation:** PE-owned industrial distributor, $80M revenue, 8% EBITDA margin

**Revenue Growth Diagnostic:**

| Area | Finding | Opportunity |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Pricing | No increase in 3 years | 5-8% increase feasible |
| Sales | 12 reps, wide performance range | Top quartile = 2x average |
| Customers | 40% from 5 accounts | Concentration risk, expansion opportunity |
| Geography | 3 states only | Adjacent state expansion |

**Revenue Growth Plan:**

**Year 1 Initiatives:**

| Initiative | Investment | Revenue Impact | Margin Impact |
|------------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| 5% price increase | $50K (communication) | $4M | $4M |
| Sales training program | $100K | $2M | $400K |
| Territory optimization | $25K | $1.5M | $300K |

**Year 2-3 Initiatives:**

|------------|------------|----------------|
| Adjacent state expansion | $500K | $8M |
| Add-on acquisition | $10M | $15M |
| New product line | $200K | $3M |

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Pricing Analysis
A company has 500 customers with average revenue of $100K. Analysis shows 20% are underpriced by 15%, 60% are at market, and 20% are overpriced by 10%. Design a pricing strategy that maximizes revenue while minimizing churn risk.

### Problem 2: Sales Productivity
A sales team of 10 reps produces $20M in revenue. The top 2 reps produce $6M, the middle 4 produce $8M, and the bottom 4 produce $6M. What are your recommendations to improve productivity?

### Problem 3: Expansion Decision
Your $50M revenue company serves the healthcare vertical in the Northeast US. You're considering: (a) Geographic expansion to Southeast, (b) Vertical expansion to education, (c) Acquisition of a $15M competitor. Evaluate each option.
