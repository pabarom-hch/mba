# Lesson 1: First 100 Days

> Establishing momentum and governance in the critical post-acquisition period

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Design a structured First 100 Days integration plan
- Identify and capture quick wins
- Establish effective governance and reporting structures
- Manage stakeholder communication during transition
- Balance speed with organizational stability

## Introduction

The first 100 days after acquisition are critical. This period sets the tone for the entire ownership period, establishes credibility with management and employees, and captures time-sensitive value creation opportunities. Get it right, and you build momentum for transformation. Get it wrong, and you face years of organizational resistance.

This lesson provides a structured framework for post-acquisition integration.

## CEO Application

If you're a CEO entering PE ownership:

**Your First 100 Days Priorities:**

1. **Build trust with PE partner** — transparency, no surprises
2. **Secure your team** — identify and retain key people
3. **Deliver early wins** — prove execution capability
4. **Set the tone** — communicate change is coming
5. **Protect the core** — don't break what works

**What PE Expects From You:**

| Area | Expectation |
|------|-------------|
| Communication | Weekly updates, proactive on issues |
| Accountability | Own the plan, report against it |
| Speed | Bias toward action |
| Transparency | Share bad news early |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **First 100 days set the trajectory** — investment in planning pays off
2. **Three phases: Assess, Plan, Execute** — structured approach reduces risk
3. **Quick wins build credibility** — capture visible, achievable wins early
4. **Governance enables accountability** — establish reporting infrastructure
5. **Communication is critical** — every stakeholder needs the right message
6. **Balance speed and stability** — move fast but bring people along

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: 100-Day Plan Development
You've just closed on a $30M revenue manufacturing company. The DD identified pricing opportunity (10% below market), weak finance function, and outdated technology. Design a 100-day plan with specific activities by week.

### Problem 2: Quick Win Prioritization
Given these potential quick wins, prioritize using the Impact/Ease matrix:
- 5% price increase to all customers
- Consolidate two facilities
- Renegotiate top 5 vendor contracts
- Implement new ERP system
- Reduce overtime by 20%
- Add sales headcount

### Problem 3: Stakeholder Communication
The company you acquired has a unionized workforce and a major customer representing 25% of revenue. Design a communication plan for the first 30 days.
