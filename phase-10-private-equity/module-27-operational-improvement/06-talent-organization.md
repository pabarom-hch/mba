## Framework: Incentive Alignment

### Management Equity Programs

```
PE MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE STRUCTURE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

COMPONENT 1: MANAGEMENT EQUITY POOL (typically 10-20%)
├── CEO: 3-7% of pool
├── CFO: 1-3% of pool
├── Other C-suite: 1-2% each
└── VP level: 0.5-1% each

COMPONENT 2: VESTING
├── Time vesting (typically 4-5 years)
├── Performance vesting (EBITDA targets)
└── Cliff (usually year 1)

COMPONENT 3: EXIT VALUE
├── Participation in exit upside
├── Aligned with investor returns
└── Creates wealth accumulation opportunity

EXAMPLE:
─────────
$100M equity value at exit
Management pool: 15% = $15M
CEO (5% of total): $5M
CFO (2% of total): $2M
```

### Incentive Design Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Meaningful upside** | Life-changing wealth potential |
| **Aligned with value creation** | Returns when investors return |
| **Clear targets** | Transparent goals and metrics |
| **Balanced short/long-term** | Annual bonus + equity |
| **Retention hook** | Vesting creates "golden handcuffs" |

### Annual Bonus Structure

| Level | Target % | Metrics |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **CEO** | 75-100% | EBITDA, strategic initiatives |
| **CFO** | 50-75% | EBITDA, working capital, reporting |
| **COO** | 50-75% | EBITDA, operational KPIs |
| **Sales VP** | 75-100% | Revenue, margin, pipeline |

**Common Bonus Metrics:**
- EBITDA vs. budget (40-50% weight)
- Revenue vs. budget (20-30% weight)
- Individual objectives (20-30% weight)

## CEO Application

### Building a High-Performance Team

**For CEOs driving talent improvement:**

1. **Own talent decisions** — CEO's most important job
2. **Set clear expectations** — Performance standards
3. **Provide regular feedback** — Monthly 1:1s minimum
4. **Develop continuously** — Training and coaching
5. **Move fast on misses** — Bad fit hurts everyone

### Talent Dashboard

| Metric | Frequency | Target |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Key person retention | Monthly | 100% |
| Open positions | Weekly | <5% of headcount |
| Time to fill critical roles | Monthly | <90 days |
| Engagement score | Quarterly | Top quartile |
| Succession coverage | Quarterly | 2 candidates per critical role |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **People drive everything** — Talent is the primary value lever
2. **Assess early and honestly** — Know your team by Day 90
3. **Decide and act** — Prolonging poor fit hurts everyone
4. **Align incentives** — Meaningful equity creates ownership
5. **Design for scale** — Organization must grow with company
6. **Build the bench** — Succession reduces risk, creates options

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Management Assessment
You've acquired a company with a founder-CEO who's also the majority shareholder. The CEO is operationally strong but struggles with financial management and board interaction. How would you approach this situation?

### Problem 2: Incentive Design
Design a management equity program for a $50M EBITDA company being acquired for $400M. The target management pool is 15%, and you need to allocate across CEO, CFO, COO, and VP Sales.

### Problem 3: Organizational Redesign
A 300-person company has 8 layers of management, an average span of control of 4, and 25% of employees are managers. What's wrong, and how would you fix it?
