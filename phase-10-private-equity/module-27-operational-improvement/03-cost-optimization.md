# Lesson 3: Cost Optimization

> Driving margin improvement through strategic cost management

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Conduct a comprehensive cost diagnostic
- Design and execute procurement optimization programs
- Identify and capture labor efficiency improvements
- Reduce overhead and G&A costs strategically
- Implement sustainable cost management practices

---

## Introduction

Cost optimization is often the most reliable value creation lever in PE. Unlike revenue growth, which depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics, cost improvements are largely within management control. A well-executed cost program can add 200-500 basis points to EBITDA margins within 12-18 months. This lesson covers the systematic approach to sustainable cost reduction.

### Cost Reduction Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Start with data** | Granular spend analysis before action |
| **Focus on the big buckets** | 80/20 rule applies |
| **Preserve strategic capability** | Don't cut muscle |
| **Make it sustainable** | One-time cuts return |
| **Gain organizational buy-in** | Top-down and bottom-up |
| **Track and hold gains** | Measurement prevents drift |

## CEO Application

### Building Cost Management Culture

**For CEOs driving cost optimization:**

1. **Own the cost culture** — Set the tone from the top
2. **Demand data** — Decisions based on facts
3. **Question everything** — "Why do we do this?"
4. **Celebrate efficiency** — Recognize cost-conscious behavior
5. **Invest savings** — Reinvest in growth and capability

### Cost Management Dashboard

| Metric | Frequency | Target |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Cost per unit | Monthly | Year-over-year improvement |
| Procurement savings | Monthly | Track to plan |
| Overtime hours | Weekly | < 5% of regular hours |
| G&A as % of revenue | Monthly | Declining trend |
| Initiative status | Weekly | On track |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Data drives decisions** — Start with granular spend analysis
2. **Procurement is fastest** — Strategic sourcing yields 5-15%
3. **Labor requires care** — Balance efficiency with capability
4. **Overhead has hidden waste** — Review every contract
5. **Make it sustainable** — Structural change, not one-time cuts
6. **Track relentlessly** — What gets measured gets done

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Spend Analysis
You've received 18 months of AP data for a $50M revenue company. How would you structure the analysis to identify top procurement opportunities?

### Problem 2: Labor Efficiency
A service company has 200 employees producing $40M revenue. Overtime is 20% of regular hours, and there are 35 supervisors (5.7:1 span). What initiatives would you prioritize?

### Problem 3: Cost Reduction Program
Design a 12-month cost reduction program targeting $2M in savings (4% of cost base). What's your initiative mix, timeline, and governance structure?
