# Lesson 7: Deal Structuring Fundamentals

> Understanding purchase agreements, terms, and deal mechanics

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand key components of a PE purchase agreement
- Explain common deal structuring mechanisms
- Identify how risk is allocated between buyer and seller
- Navigate earnouts, escrows, and indemnities
- Apply deal terms to protect and enhance returns

---

## Introduction

Deal structuring is where due diligence findings translate into transaction terms. The structure of a deal—not just the price—determines risk allocation, return profiles, and relationship dynamics between buyer, seller, and management. Understanding these mechanics is essential for anyone involved in PE transactions.

This lesson covers the fundamental building blocks of PE deal structure, from the letter of intent through closing.

### Letter of Intent (LOI) / Term Sheet

The LOI outlines key deal terms before detailed negotiation:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Purchase Price** | Enterprise value, equity value, structure |
| **Consideration** | Cash, rollover equity, earnout |
| **Exclusivity** | Period seller cannot talk to other buyers |
| **Due Diligence** | Scope and timeline |
| **Conditions** | Financing, regulatory, key DD findings |
| **Break-up Fee** | Payment if deal fails (sometimes) |

**Binding vs. Non-Binding:**
- Most terms are non-binding (price, structure)
- Binding terms: Exclusivity, confidentiality, expense allocation

---

### Stock Purchase vs. Asset Purchase

| Dimension | Stock Purchase | Asset Purchase |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **What's acquired** | Company equity/shares | Selected assets & liabilities |
| **Liabilities** | All assumed (known & unknown) | Only assumed liabilities |
| **Contracts** | Transfer automatically | May require consent |
| **Tax basis** | Carryover basis | Step-up to FMV |
| **Seller preference** | Usually preferred | Often not preferred |
| **Buyer preference** | Simpler execution | More protection |

**When to Use Each:**

```
STOCK PURCHASE when:
• Contracts don't transfer easily (licenses, permits)
• Tax considerations favor seller
• Speed is critical
• Company is "clean" with limited liability concerns

ASSET PURCHASE when:
• Want to cherry-pick assets
• Significant liability concerns
• Tax step-up is valuable
• Carving out a division
```

---

### Purchase Price Mechanics

#### Enterprise Value vs. Equity Value

```
ENTERPRISE VALUE ─────────────────────────────► What the business is worth
      │
      │ - Net Debt (debt minus cash)
      │ - Debt-like items (pension, deferred revenue, etc.)
      │ + Cash-like items
      │ +/- Working capital adjustment
      │
      ▼
EQUITY VALUE ──────────────────────────────────► What shareholders receive
```

#### Purchase Price Adjustments

| Adjustment | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Net Debt** | Adjust for actual debt/cash at close |
| **Working Capital** | True-up to agreed target |
| **Capex** | Adjust for under/over spending |
| **Transaction Expenses** | Allocate deal costs |

**Working Capital Mechanism:**

```
Working Capital Adjustment Example:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Target Working Capital (agreed):        $5.0M
Actual Working Capital at Close:        $4.2M
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Shortfall:                             ($0.8M)

Purchase Price Reduction:              ($0.8M)

This protects buyer from seller depleting
working capital before close.
```

---

### Risk Allocation Mechanisms

#### Representations and Warranties (Reps)

Seller statements about the business that form basis for indemnification:

**Fundamental Reps** (longer survival, higher caps):
- Organization and authority
- Ownership/capitalization
- No conflicts
- Broker fees

**Business Reps** (shorter survival, capped):
- Financial statements
- Contracts
- Litigation
- Tax matters
- Employees
- Environmental
- IP

#### Indemnification

```
INDEMNIFICATION STRUCTURE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

If rep proves false after closing:
│
├── Basket (deductible)
│   └── Buyer absorbs first $X of losses
│       (typically 0.5-1.0% of EV)
│
├── Cap (maximum exposure)
│   └── Seller indemnity limited to $Y
│       (typically 10-20% of EV for general reps)
│
├── Escrow (source of recovery)
│   └── $Z held back at closing
│       (typically 10-15% of purchase price)
│
└── Survival Period
    └── How long claims can be brought
        (12-24 months for general reps)
```

**Sample Terms:**

| Term | Mid-Market Typical |
|------|-------------------|
| Basket | 0.75% of EV (tipping) |
| General Cap | 15% of EV |
| Fundamental Cap | 100% of purchase price |
| Escrow | 10% for 15 months |
| General Survival | 18 months |
| Fundamental Survival | 6 years |
| Tax Survival | Statute of limitations |

---

### Earnouts

Earnouts are contingent payments tied to post-close performance:

```
EARNOUT STRUCTURE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Upfront Payment: $80M (80% of $100M value)
Earnout:         Up to $20M over 2 years

Year 1: If EBITDA > $12M → $10M payment
Year 2: If EBITDA > $14M → $10M payment

Total Consideration: $80M to $100M
depending on performance
```

**When Earnouts Make Sense:**

| Situation | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Valuation gap | Bridge price disagreement |
| Key customer risk | Tie payment to retention |
| Growth uncertainty | Seller shares upside risk |
| Management rollover | Align incentives |

**Earnout Pitfalls:**

| Issue | Mitigation |
|-------|------------|
| Metric manipulation | Detailed definitions |
| Operational changes | Operating covenants |
| Disputes | Arbitration provisions |
| Integration conflicts | Clear earn-out perimeter |

---

### Seller Notes and Rollover Equity

#### Seller Financing

Seller receives a promissory note instead of cash:

```
SELLER NOTE EXAMPLE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Purchase Price:       $50M
Cash at Close:        $45M
Seller Note:          $5M
  • Term: 3 years
  • Interest: 6%
  • Subordinated to senior debt
  • Paid at exit or refinance
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces buyer equity requirement
- Aligns seller with continued success
- Provides subordinated capital

#### Management Rollover

Management invests proceeds into NewCo equity:

```
ROLLOVER STRUCTURE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Pre-Transaction:
CEO owns 20% of $40M company = $8M value

Post-Transaction:
• CEO sells 75% → receives $6M cash
• CEO rolls 25% → $2M into NewCo equity
• PE invests $28M equity
• Total equity: $30M

CEO owns 6.7% of NewCo ($2M / $30M)
If exit at 3x: $2M → $6M (+ cash received)
```

---

## Framework: Deal Term Matrix

| Issue | Seller-Friendly | Buyer-Friendly |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Price** | All cash at close | Earnout, rollover |
| **Reps Scope** | Narrow, qualified | Broad, unqualified |
| **Basket** | High (1%+) | Low (0.5%) |
| **Cap** | Low (10%) | High (25%+) |
| **Escrow** | Small, short | Large, long |
| **Survival** | Short (12 mo) | Long (24 mo+) |
| **Mat. Adverse Change** | High threshold | Low threshold |
| **Non-compete** | Narrow | Broad |

---

## Worked Example: Deal Structure

**Scenario:** $100M acquisition of software company

### Agreed Terms

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Enterprise Value | $100M |
| Less: Net Debt | ($10M) |
| Base Equity Value | $90M |
| Working Capital Target | $5M |
| Earnout | Up to $15M |

### Consideration Mix

| Source | Amount | % |
|--------|--------|---|
| Cash at Close | $72M | 80% |
| Seller Note (3yr, 6%) | $9M | 10% |
| Management Rollover | $9M | 10% |
| **Total at Close** | **$90M** | 100% |
| Earnout Potential | $15M | — |
| **Maximum Total** | **$105M** | — |

### Protection Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Terms |
|-----------|-------|
| Escrow | $9M (10%) for 18 months |
| Basket | $500K (0.5% of EV) |
| General Cap | $15M (15% of EV) |
| Fundamental Cap | Full purchase price |
| R&W Insurance | $30M policy |

### Purchase Price Adjustments

```
Base Equity Value:              $90.0M
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Estimated Net Debt:            ($10.0M)
Actual Net Debt at Close:      ($11.2M)
Net Debt Adjustment:            ($1.2M)

Target Working Capital:          $5.0M
Actual Working Capital:          $4.5M
WC Adjustment:                  ($0.5M)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Final Equity Value:             $88.3M
```

## PE Application

### Representations & Warranties Insurance (R&W)

R&W insurance has transformed PE deal-making:

```
R&W INSURANCE STRUCTURE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Coverage: $30M policy
Premium: ~3% of coverage ($900K)
Retention: $1.5M (buyer eats first losses)

Benefits:
• Seller gets cleaner exit
• Buyer has creditworthy insurer to claim against
• Facilitates competitive bids
• Reduces escrow requirements
```

### Key Negotiation Dynamics

| Party | Primary Concerns |
|-------|------------------|
| **Seller** | Maximize cash, minimize post-close liability |
| **PE Buyer** | Pay appropriate price, protect against surprises |
| **Lenders** | Security, cash flow coverage, control provisions |
| **Management** | Equity, employment terms, control |

---

## CEO Application

### If You're Selling

**Key Terms to Negotiate:**
1. Cash vs. rollover mix
2. Escrow size and duration
3. Earnout metrics and control
4. Non-compete scope
5. Employment agreement

**Protect Yourself:**
- Get separate legal counsel (not company counsel)
- Understand your rollover terms
- Negotiate D&O insurance tail
- Define earnout metrics precisely
- Secure employment agreement before close

### If You're the Incoming CEO

**Understand:**
- Your equity structure and vesting
- Board composition and dynamics
- Key decisions requiring PE approval
- Management fee and monitoring fees
- Exit timeline expectations

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Focusing only on price | Terms matter as much | Evaluate full package |
| Loose working capital definition | Disputes after close | Detailed WC definition |
| Vague earnout metrics | Manipulation risk | Specific, audited metrics |
| Ignoring rep & warranty details | Post-close exposure | Negotiate carefully |
| Skipping R&W insurance analysis | Leaving value on table | Get quotes early |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **LOI sets the framework** but most terms are non-binding
2. **Stock vs. asset purchase** has significant legal and tax implications
3. **Purchase price adjusts** for net debt, working capital, and other items
4. **Reps and warranties** allocate risk between parties
5. **Escrows and indemnities** provide buyer protection
6. **Earnouts bridge** valuation gaps but create complexity
7. **R&W insurance** has become standard in PE transactions

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Purchase Price Calculation
Calculate final equity value:
- Agreed EV: $75M
- Target WC: $6M, Actual WC at close: $7.2M
- Estimated Net Debt: $15M, Actual: $13M
- Transaction expenses (seller responsibility): $1.5M

### Problem 2: Earnout Design
A founder wants $50M but you value the business at $40M. The gap is due to a new product launching next year. Design an earnout structure that bridges the gap while protecting the buyer.

### Problem 3: Risk Allocation
Due diligence reveals a $2M potential environmental liability (probability 30%). How would you structure the deal to address this?
