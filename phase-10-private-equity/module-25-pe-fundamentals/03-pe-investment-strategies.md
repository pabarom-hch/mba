## Introduction

Private equity is not monolithic. The term encompasses a wide range of investment strategies, each with distinct characteristics, risk profiles, and value creation approaches. Understanding these differences is critical for matching strategies to opportunities and setting appropriate return expectations.

This lesson covers the five primary PE strategies: Buyout, Growth Equity, Venture Capital, Distressed/Turnaround, and Special Situations.

### 1. Buyout (LBO)

**Definition:** Acquiring controlling stakes in mature companies, typically using significant debt financing.

**Characteristics:**

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Majority/control (51-100%) |
| **Target Stage** | Mature, profitable companies |
| **Leverage** | 40-70% of purchase price |
| **Holding Period** | 4-6 years |
| **Value Creation** | Operational + financial engineering |
| **Risk Profile** | Moderate (stable cash flows) |

**Sub-Categories:**

```
BUYOUT TYPES
├── Large Cap (>$1B enterprise value)
│   └── Take-privates, corporate carveouts
├── Mid-Market ($100M-$1B EV)
│   └── Family businesses, founder exits
├── Lower Mid-Market ($25M-$100M EV)
│   └── Small businesses, roll-ups
└── Small Cap (<$25M EV)
    └── Search funds, fundless sponsors
```

**Value Creation Levers:**
1. Revenue growth (organic + M&A)
2. Margin expansion (cost optimization)
3. Multiple expansion (market positioning)
4. Debt paydown (deleveraging)

**Example Deal:**
- Target: Regional plumbing services company
- Purchase: $80M at 8x EBITDA ($10M EBITDA)
- Structure: 50% equity ($40M), 50% debt ($40M)
- Value creation: Tuck-in acquisitions, pricing power, shared services
- Exit: $160M at 10x EBITDA ($16M EBITDA) in 5 years
- Returns: ~3x MOIC, ~25% IRR

---

### 2. Growth Equity

**Definition:** Minority or majority investments in rapidly growing companies that are typically profitable or near-profitable.

**Characteristics:**

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Minority to control (20-60%) |
| **Target Stage** | Growth-stage, revenue scaling |
| **Leverage** | Little to none |
| **Holding Period** | 4-7 years |
| **Value Creation** | Accelerate growth trajectory |
| **Risk Profile** | Moderate-high (execution risk) |

**Ideal Targets:**
- $10M-$100M revenue
- 20%+ annual growth
- Proven business model
- Need capital for expansion
- Founder wants partial liquidity

**Value Creation Focus:**
- Market expansion (new geographies, channels)
- Product development
- Sales & marketing scale-up
- Talent acquisition
- Operational infrastructure

**Example Deal:**
- Target: B2B SaaS company with $30M ARR
- Investment: $50M for 35% equity
- Use of funds: Sales team expansion, international launch
- Exit: Strategic acquisition at $400M
- Returns: ~3-4x MOIC on the investment

**Key Differences from Buyout:**
- Less/no leverage
- Minority positions common
- Growth > operational improvement
- More aligned with founders

**Key Differences from VC:**
- Established revenue and unit economics
- Lower risk profile
- Larger check sizes
- Shorter hold periods

---

### 3. Venture Capital

**Definition:** Investing in early-stage companies with high growth potential but significant risk.

**Characteristics:**

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Minority (10-30% per round) |
| **Target Stage** | Seed to late-stage |
| **Leverage** | None |
| **Holding Period** | 7-10+ years |
| **Value Creation** | Support scaling |
| **Risk Profile** | Very high (most fail) |

**Investment Stages:**

```
VENTURE STAGES
│
├── Pre-Seed ($100K-$500K)
│   └── Idea stage, founding team
│
├── Seed ($500K-$3M)
│   └── MVP, initial customers
│
├── Series A ($5M-$15M)
│   └── Product-market fit, scaling
│
├── Series B ($15M-$50M)
│   └── Proven model, rapid growth
│
├── Series C+ ($50M+)
│   └── Market leadership, pre-IPO
│
└── Late Stage / Pre-IPO ($100M+)
    └── Clear path to public markets
```

**Power Law Returns:**
Most VC returns come from a small number of winners:
- 50% of investments return <1x
- 30% return 1-3x
- 15% return 3-10x
- 5% return 10x+ (but drive fund returns)

**VC vs. PE Buyout:**
| Factor | VC | Buyout |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Revenue requirement | None/minimal | Significant |
| Profitability | Typically unprofitable | Profitable |
| Leverage | None | Significant |
| Board control | Minority | Majority |
| Failure rate | 50%+ | <10% |

---

### 4. Distressed / Turnaround

**Definition:** Investing in financially troubled companies, either through equity or debt positions.

**Characteristics:**

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Control (via equity or debt) |
| **Target Stage** | Distressed, declining |
| **Leverage** | Existing debt is the opportunity |
| **Holding Period** | 2-5 years |
| **Value Creation** | Stabilization + restructuring |
| **Risk Profile** | High (binary outcomes) |

**Investment Approaches:**

```
DISTRESSED STRATEGIES
│
├── Control Distressed
│   └── Buy equity, restructure operations
│
├── Loan-to-Own
│   └── Buy debt, convert to equity in bankruptcy
│
├── Distressed Debt Trading
│   └── Buy/sell debt for trading gains
│
└── Rescue Capital
    └── Provide emergency financing
```

**Value Creation Playbook:**
1. **Stabilize cash** - Immediate liquidity
2. **Restructure debt** - Negotiate with creditors
3. **Cut costs** - Right-size operations
4. **Fix operations** - Address root causes
5. **Reposition** - Rebuild for growth
6. **Exit** - Sale to strategic or financial buyer

**Example Deal:**
- Situation: $200M revenue manufacturer, $50M debt, negative EBITDA
- Action: Acquire for $20M, negotiate debt down to $25M
- Turnaround: Close unprofitable plants, new management, cost cuts
- Result: $15M EBITDA in Year 3
- Exit: Sale at $120M (8x EBITDA)
- Returns: 6x MOIC

---

### 5. Special Situations

**Definition:** Opportunistic investments driven by specific events or circumstances.

**Examples:**

| Type | Description | Opportunity |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Spin-offs** | Corporate divestitures | Undervalued asset |
| **PIPE** | Private investment in public equity | Discounted entry |
| **Activist** | Take position, push for change | Unlock value |
| **Litigation finance** | Fund lawsuits for share of recovery | Asymmetric risk |
| **Royalty/streaming** | Buy future cash flows | Stable, diversified income |
| **Capital solutions** | Structured financing | Fill market gaps |

**Characteristics:**
- Opportunistic, not strategy-driven
- Event-dependent
- Often hybrid debt/equity
- Requires specialized expertise
- Less correlated with broader PE

## Worked Example: Strategy Classification

**Classify each opportunity:**

| Opportunity | Key Facts | Strategy |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| A | $5M ARR SaaS, 100% YoY growth, pre-profit | **Growth Equity** |
| B | $150M revenue distributor, $20M EBITDA, family-owned | **Buyout** |
| C | Pre-revenue AI startup, founding team only | **Venture Capital** |
| D | $80M retailer, missed debt covenants, restructuring | **Distressed** |
| E | Large-cap company spinning off division | **Special Situations** |

## PE Application

### Strategy Evolution Over Fund Life

Many PE firms have evolved from single-strategy to multi-strategy:

```
TRADITIONAL                    MODERN MULTI-STRATEGY
─────────────                 ───────────────────────

   Buyout      ───────────►     Buyout Fund
   Only                         Growth Fund
                                Credit Fund
                                Infrastructure Fund
                                Secondaries Fund
```

**Examples:**
- **Blackstone:** Started buyout → now includes real estate, credit, infrastructure
- **KKR:** Started buyout → added growth, credit, infrastructure, real estate
- **General Atlantic:** Pure growth equity focus

### Strategy Implications for Portcos

If you're running a PE-backed company, your sponsor's strategy affects:

| Your Situation | Strategy Impact |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Growth expectations** | Buyout = operational; Growth = top-line |
| **Leverage tolerance** | Buyout = high; Growth = low |
| **Exit timeline** | Distressed = faster; VC = longer |
| **Add-on appetite** | Buyout = core strategy; Growth = selective |
| **Risk tolerance** | VC = moonshots; Buyout = steady execution |

## CEO Application

### Matching Your Company to PE Strategy

| If Your Company Is... | Best PE Match |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Profitable, slow growth, family-owned | Buyout |
| Fast-growing, need expansion capital | Growth Equity |
| Early-stage, high-risk innovation | Venture Capital |
| Struggling but fixable | Distressed/Turnaround |

### Questions for PE Sponsors

1. What is your fund's primary strategy?
2. What other portfolio companies have similar profiles to us?
3. How active is your operating team vs. deal team?
4. What is your typical hold period for companies like ours?
5. How do you approach add-on acquisitions?

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Treating all PE the same | Strategies have different dynamics | Match strategy to situation |
| Ignoring leverage differences | Risk profiles vary dramatically | Understand capital structure |
| Expecting VC returns from buyout | Different risk/return profiles | Set appropriate expectations |
| Misreading growth vs. buyout | Different value creation approaches | Understand what's being optimized |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **PE encompasses multiple strategies** with distinct risk/return profiles
2. **Buyout** focuses on mature companies with leverage and operational improvement
3. **Growth equity** backs scaling companies without heavy leverage
4. **Venture capital** accepts high failure rates for potential 10x+ winners
5. **Distressed** creates value through restructuring and turnarounds
6. **Special situations** are opportunistic, event-driven investments
7. **Strategy choice** depends on company stage, risk tolerance, and value creation approach

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Strategy Matching
A founder is considering selling their $50M revenue, $8M EBITDA industrial services company. They want to retire fully. What PE strategy is most appropriate and why?

### Problem 2: Return Expectations
Why would an LP allocate to both buyout and VC funds? How do the risk/return profiles complement each other?

### Problem 3: Value Creation Comparison
Compare the primary value creation levers for:
a) A buyout of a regional HVAC services company
b) A growth equity investment in a Series B fintech
c) A distressed investment in a struggling retailer
