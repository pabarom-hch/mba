## CEO Application

### If You're Considering PE-Backed CEO Role

**Evaluate:**
1. **Fund stage** - Is there runway for value creation?
2. **Board dynamics** - How active is the PE sponsor?
3. **Equity package** - What's your ownership and vesting?
4. **Exit timeline** - How does it align with your goals?
5. **Team quality** - Can you build the team you need?

**Questions to Ask PE Sponsors:**

| Topic | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Style** | How active is the board? Weekly calls or monthly? |
| **Resources** | What operating support do you provide? |
| **Timeline** | What's your expected hold period? |
| **Decisions** | What requires board approval? |
| **Equity** | What's the typical CEO package? |
| **Add-ons** | How do you approach bolt-on M&A? |

### CEO Compensation in PE-Backed Companies

|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Targeting wrong fund size | Skills don't match | Match experience to opportunity |
| Ignoring operations track | Missing best fit | Consider all paths |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Multiple paths exist** in PE: deal track, operations, LP investing
2. **Deal track** typically requires IB/consulting background
3. **Operations track** suits former operators and consultants
4. **Compensation is exceptional** but path is competitive
5. **Recruiting starts early** and is highly structured
6. **Skills development** should be intentional and ongoing
7. **PE-backed CEO** roles offer significant equity upside

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Career Planning
You're a second-year IB analyst considering PE. What should you evaluate when comparing mega-fund vs. mid-market opportunities?

### Problem 2: Compensation Analysis
A VP at a $1B fund is offered the CEO role at a portfolio company. Compare the expected 5-year compensation in each path.

### Problem 3: Operating Partner Assessment
A retiring Fortune 500 division president is considering operating partner roles. What type of fund and role would be the best fit?
