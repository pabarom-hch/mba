## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Distinguish between different types of due diligence
- Identify key focus areas for each diligence workstream
- Understand red flags and deal-breakers
- Apply due diligence findings to valuation and deal terms

## Introduction

Due diligence is the systematic investigation of a target company before acquisition. It validates the investment thesis, identifies risks, uncovers opportunities, and informs pricing and deal structure. Thorough due diligence separates successful PE investments from costly mistakes.

PE due diligence goes far beyond traditional M&A diligence. PE firms need to understand not just what the business is today, but what it can become under their ownership.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Due diligence validates** the investment thesis and identifies risks
2. **Four pillars:** commercial, financial, operational, and legal
3. **Quality of Earnings** is the most critical financial diligence
4. **Red flags** can kill deals or require price/term adjustments
5. **Management assessment** is essential for value creation planning
6. **Customer calls** reveal commercial reality
7. **DD findings** directly impact purchase price and deal terms

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: QofE Analysis
A company reports $10M EBITDA. You discover:
- $400K of CEO personal expenses run through the company
- $300K one-time legal settlement
- $200K of revenue was pulled forward from next quarter
- A $500K/year contract was lost last month (not reflected)

What is pro forma EBITDA?

### Problem 2: Red Flag Assessment
You're evaluating a target with:
- 60% of revenue from one customer (10-year relationship)
- Pending patent infringement lawsuit (company confident will win)
- Founder/CEO planning to retire post-close

How would you structure the deal to mitigate these risks?

### Problem 3: DD Scope Prioritization
You have a compressed 3-week diligence window for a $50M acquisition. How would you prioritize workstreams and what could you defer to post-close?
