# Lesson 1: Introduction to Private Equity

> Understanding the PE industry structure, players, and ecosystem

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define Private Equity and distinguish it from other asset classes
- Identify the key participants in the PE ecosystem
- Understand the PE fund lifecycle
- Compare major PE strategies at a high level

---

## Introduction

Private Equity is an alternative asset class where investors provide capital to companies that are not publicly traded. Unlike buying stocks on an exchange, PE involves taking significant (often controlling) ownership stakes in companies with the goal of improving them and selling at a profit.

**Why does PE exist?**

PE fills gaps that public markets cannot:
1. **Longer time horizons** - Public companies face quarterly pressure; PE can invest for 5-7 years
2. **Active ownership** - PE firms take board seats and drive strategy
3. **Operational expertise** - Many PE firms bring industry and functional knowledge
4. **Access to capital** - PE provides growth capital or acquisition financing

## Core Concepts

### What is Private Equity?

**Definition:** Private Equity is an investment strategy that involves acquiring equity ownership in companies, typically using a combination of investor capital and debt, with the goal of creating value and exiting at a profit.

**Key Characteristics:**
| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Illiquid** | Cannot sell shares on an exchange; must wait for exit |
| **Long-term** | Typical holding period of 4-7 years |
| **Active** | PE firms take board seats and influence strategy |
| **Leveraged** | Often use debt to finance acquisitions |
| **Fee-based** | GPs charge management fees and carried interest |

### PE vs. Other Investment Strategies

| Strategy | Ownership | Time Horizon | Value Creation |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Public Equity** | Minority, passive | Days to years | Market appreciation |
| **Private Equity** | Majority/control | 4-7 years | Operational + financial |
| **Venture Capital** | Minority | 7-10 years | Growth + exit |
| **Hedge Funds** | Minority, trading | Days to months | Trading strategies |
| **Real Estate PE** | Majority | 3-10 years | Property improvement |

### By Size
| Category | Deal Size | Typical Targets |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Mega/Large Cap** | >$1B | Large, mature companies |
| **Upper Mid-Market** | $500M-$1B | Regional leaders |
| **Mid-Market** | $100M-$500M | Growth companies |
| **Lower Mid-Market** | $25M-$100M | Small businesses |
| **Small Cap** | <$25M | Local businesses, fundless sponsors |

---

## Worked Example: Mapping the PE Ecosystem

**Scenario:** A $500M PE fund is acquiring a $150M manufacturing company.

**Participants Map:**

| Role | Entity | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| **GP** | Apex Capital Partners | Managing the acquisition |
| **LPs** | CalPERS, Yale Endowment, etc. | Providing fund capital |
| **Target** | Midwest Manufacturing Co. | Being acquired |
| **Sellers** | Founder family | Receiving proceeds |
| **Lenders** | Goldman, Citizens Bank | Providing $90M debt |
| **M&A Advisor** | Harris Williams | Running the sale process |
| **Buyer's Counsel** | Kirkland & Ellis | GP's transaction lawyers |
| **Seller's Counsel** | Latham & Watkins | Family's lawyers |
| **Accounting** | EY | Quality of earnings |
| **Consultants** | Bain & Co | Commercial due diligence |

## PE Application

### How PE Firms Think About Industries

PE firms typically favor:

**Attractive Characteristics:**
- Recurring revenue or sticky customers
- Fragmented markets (consolidation opportunity)
- Stable, predictable cash flows
- Low capital intensity
- Resilience to economic cycles
- Clear value creation playbook

**Less Attractive Characteristics:**
- Commodity businesses with no differentiation
- High regulatory risk
- Rapid technology obsolescence
- Heavy capital requirements
- Customer concentration

### Industry Focus Trends

| Era | Hot Sectors | Drivers |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| 2000s | Healthcare, Consumer | Aging population, LBO boom |
| 2010s | Tech/Software, Healthcare | Cloud, recurring revenue |
| 2020s | Software, Healthcare IT, Climate | Digitization, ESG |

---

## CEO Application

If you're leading a PE-backed company, understand:

1. **Your investors' timeline** - When does the fund need to exit?
2. **Return expectations** - What MOIC/IRR are they targeting?
3. **Board dynamics** - How active will the PE firm be?
4. **Value creation plan** - What specific initiatives are expected?
5. **Exit path** - Strategic sale, financial sponsor, or IPO?

**Questions to Ask Your PE Sponsors:**
- What's your typical holding period?
- What resources (operating partners, functional experts) do you provide?
- How do you approach add-on acquisitions?
- What does a successful exit look like?
- How will my incentive compensation be structured?

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Confusing PE with VC | Very different risk/return profiles | Understand the spectrum |
| Ignoring LP relationships | LPs are the ultimate customer | Build LP understanding |
| Underestimating holding period | PE is illiquid | Plan for 5-7 years minimum |
| Forgetting debt role | Leverage is core to PE returns | Understand capital structure |
| Thinking PE is just financial engineering | Operations matter more now | Focus on value creation |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **PE is an asset class** focused on acquiring, improving, and exiting companies
2. **GPs manage funds** and make investment decisions; **LPs provide capital**
3. **Fund lifecycle** is typically 10 years with distinct investment, management, and harvest phases
4. **PE strategies** range from venture to distressed, with buyout being the largest
5. **The ecosystem** includes investment banks, lawyers, accountants, consultants, and lenders
6. **PE creates value** through operational improvement, financial engineering, and strategic positioning

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Ecosystem Mapping
A PE firm is evaluating a $200M acquisition of a software company. List all the parties likely to be involved and their roles.

### Problem 2: Strategy Classification
Classify each scenario into the appropriate PE strategy:
a) Acquiring a 15% stake in a Series B startup
b) Buying a distressed retailer in bankruptcy
c) Taking a $3B conglomerate private
d) Acquiring a 60% stake in a profitable, growing company

### Problem 3: Fund Timeline
A GP raises Fund IV in 2024. When would you expect:
a) Most capital to be deployed?
b) Most exits to occur?
c) The fund to be fully wound down?
