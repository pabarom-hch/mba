## Exhibit 3: The Sustainability Question

### Can This Continue?

```
ARGUMENTS FOR CONTINUING NO-AD:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Brand equity is established
   - Tesla = Electric car in consumer minds
   - Hard to displace category ownership

2. Cost advantage is real
   - Billions saved annually
   - Enables price competition
   - Funds innovation

3. Musk attention continues
   - X/Twitter ownership amplifies
   - Space/AI ventures create halo

4. Product differentiation remains
   - FSD/Autopilot unique
   - Supercharger network moat
   - Software superiority

ARGUMENTS FOR RECONSIDERING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Competition intensifying
   - Ford, GM spending heavily on EV
   - Chinese brands entering US
   - Share declining

2. Mass market requires different approach
   - Early adopters exhausted
   - Mainstream needs more persuasion
   - Not everyone follows Musk

3. CEO risk
   - Controversy may hurt more than help
   - Political polarization
   - Can't rely on one person

4. Quality narrative needs control
   - Reliability issues getting coverage
   - Service complaints spreading
   - Need positive message control
```

### 2024 Strategy Shift

```
RECENT CHANGES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISING:
• First paid ads appearing on YouTube, social
• Focused on specific features (safety, efficiency)
• Small budget (~$100M estimated vs. $3B competitors)

REFERRAL PROGRAM DISCONTINUED (2021):
• Was major customer acquisition tool
• Expensive: Free Supercharging, prizes
• Replaced with lower-cost alternatives

PRICE CUTS:
• Multiple price reductions 2023-2024
• Using price instead of advertising
• Margin sacrifice for volume

QUESTION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Is Tesla being forced to advertise as competition
intensifies, or strategically adding a new tool?

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Analyze unconventional marketing strategies
- Understand the role of earned media and WOM
- Evaluate brand building without traditional advertising
- Assess sustainability of disruptive approaches

### Key Insights

**Why Tesla's approach works:**
1. Category creation = brand ownership
2. Product so differentiated it markets itself
3. CEO as media magnet
4. Customer experience drives advocacy
5. Savings fund innovation (virtuous cycle)

**Necessary conditions:**
1. Truly differentiated product
2. Passionate early adopters
3. Media-worthy founder/story
4. Direct distribution control
5. High-involvement purchase category

**Risks and limitations:**
1. Mass market different from early adopters
2. CEO concentration risk
3. Competition will force spending
4. Quality narrative needs control
5. Not replicable for most companies

### Recommended Position

**Tesla should maintain primarily earned/owned approach but add selective paid media:**

Rationale:
- Core strategy working but under pressure
- Competition requires share-of-voice defense
- Control quality/safety narrative
- Reach non-Musk-followers
- Small spend can be efficient (not $3B)

Approach:
- Continue product/experience focus
- Add targeted digital advertising
- Invest in content marketing
- Customer testimonial campaigns
- Local market support where needed

### Common Student Errors

1. Assuming any company can replicate (conditions are unique)
2. Ignoring the risks of CEO-centric marketing
3. Not recognizing the competitive threat
4. Underestimating the value of controlled messaging
5. Conflating "no advertising" with "no marketing"
