- Health-conscious consumers: 30% = 75M
- Protein bar buyers: 20% = 15M
- Plant-based preference: 20% = 3M

### Section 2: Marketing Mix Strategy

**Question 4: Product Strategy**

a) BCG classification (5 points):

| Product | Classification | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Flagship phone | Cash Cow | High share, low growth |
| Mid-range phone | Star | Good share, high growth |
| Budget phone | Question Mark | Low share, high growth |
| Tablet | Dog | Moderate share, declining |
| Smartwatch | Question Mark | Low share, very high growth |

b) Portfolio recommendations (5 points):
- **Invest:** Mid-range phone (build into larger cash cow), Smartwatch (high-growth wearables market)
- **Maintain:** Flagship phone (protect cash generation)
- **Harvest/Divest:** Tablet (declining market, redeploy resources)
- **Evaluate:** Budget phone (need more share to succeed; invest or exit)

---

**Question 5: Pricing Strategy**

a) Economic value pricing (5 points):

Reference price: $50/user/month

Value calculation:
- 5 hours saved × $40/hour = $200/week savings
- Monthly savings: $200 × 4 = $800/month
- Total Economic Value: $50 + $800 = $850/user/month

Recommended price (capture 50% of differentiation value):
$50 + (0.5 × $800) = $450/user/month

This seems high, so calibrate to market willingness:
Realistic pricing: $75-100/user/month (capturing 5-10% of value)

b) Good-Better-Best structure (5 points):

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Good (Starter) | $15/user | Basic project management, 5 users max |
| Better (Pro) | $35/user | Full features, integrations, analytics |
| Best (Enterprise) | Custom | SSO, API, dedicated support, SLA |

Rationale: Anchoring effect makes Pro attractive; entry tier for adoption; enterprise for large accounts.

---

**Question 6: Distribution and Promotion**

a) Channel evaluation (5 points):

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Exclusive specialty | Brand alignment, trained staff | Limited reach |
| Mass market | High reach, volume | Brand dilution, margin pressure |
| D2C | Highest margins, data ownership | CAC, logistics |

Recommendation: D2C primary with selective specialty retail for brand experience.

b) IMC plan for D2C launch (5 points):

**Objectives:**
- 50,000 website visitors in first month
- 2,000 purchases, $200 AOV
- Build email list of 10,000

**Channels:**
- Social media (Instagram, Pinterest): Visual storytelling, UGC
- Influencer marketing: Micro-influencers in beauty/wellness
- Content marketing: Skincare education blog/YouTube
- Email: Welcome series, education, promotions

**Message:** "Luxury skincare, without the luxury markup"

**Metrics:** Traffic, conversion rate, CAC, email open/click rates, ROAS

---

### Section 3: Digital Marketing

**Question 7: Digital Funnel**

a) Metric calculations (5 points):

- Visitor-to-trial: 5,000 / 100,000 = **5%**
- Trial-to-customer: 500 / 5,000 = **10%**
- CAC: $50,000 / 500 = **$100**
- Customer lifespan: 1 / 0.05 = 20 months
- CLV: $100 × 20 = **$2,000**
- LTV:CAC ratio: $2,000 / $100 = **20:1** (excellent)

b) Improvement opportunities (5 points):

1. **Improve trial-to-customer conversion (10% → 15%)** - Focus on onboarding, in-app experience during trial, targeted nurture emails

2. **Reduce churn (5% → 3%)** - Customer success program, engagement features, early warning system for at-risk accounts

3. **Increase trial sign-ups (5% → 7%)** - A/B test landing pages, simplify sign-up flow, add social proof

---

**Question 8: Marketing Attribution**

a) Last-click ROAS (3 points):

| Channel | ROAS |
|---------|------|
| Paid Search | $400K/$100K = **4.0x** |
| Social | $160K/$80K = **2.0x** |
| Email | $200K/$20K = **10.0x** |
| Display | $40K/$50K = **0.8x** |

Best performer by last-click: Email (10x)

b) Attribution comparison (4 points):

| Channel | Last-Click | First-Click | Insight |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Paid Search | 4.0x | 2.0x | Closing channel |
| Social | 2.0x | 4.0x | Awareness driver |
| Email | 10.0x | 2.0x | Conversion closer |
| Display | 0.8x | 5.0x | Top-of-funnel |

**Insight:** Display and Social are undervalued by last-click. They drive awareness that Email and Search convert. Full-funnel view shows Display is actually valuable for prospecting.

c) Budget recommendation (3 points):

Don't cut Display despite low last-click ROAS—it drives top-of-funnel.
- Maintain Display for prospecting ($50K)
- Increase Social slightly for more top-of-funnel ($90K, +$10K)
- Optimize Paid Search keywords ($90K, -$10K to efficient ones)
- Grow email list to leverage high-converting channel

### Section 4: Comprehensive Case

**Part A: Segmentation and Targeting**

1. Current strategy analysis (4 points):

Segments served:
- Primary: Style-conscious millennials/Gen Z (25-40)
- Secondary: Value-seekers wanting quality at fair price

Attractiveness:
- Large digital-native population

2. 40+ expansion evaluation (4 points):

| Criteria | Score | Rationale |

| Profitability | High | Higher-margin progressives |
| Accessibility | Medium | Different channels needed |
| Fit | Medium | Requires product/message adaptation |

---
