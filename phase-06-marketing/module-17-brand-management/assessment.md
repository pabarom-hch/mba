## Section C: Case Analysis (40 points)

### Case: Lego Brand Transformation

**Background:**
In 2003, Lego was near bankruptcy. The Danish toy company had over-extended its brand into theme parks, clothing, video games, and numerous product lines while losing focus on its core product. By 2004, Lego had $800 million in debt and declining sales.

**The Turnaround (2004-2020):**
New CEO Jørgen Vig Knudstorp implemented a dramatic transformation:

1. **Product Focus**: Reduced product complexity by 50%, eliminating unprofitable lines
2. **Core Strength**: Returned focus to the brick-based building system
3. **Strategic Extensions**: Carefully selected partnerships (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel)
4. **Community Building**: Embraced adult fans (AFOLs) and user innovation
5. **Content Strategy**: Successful movies (The Lego Movie, 2014) and digital content
6. **Brand Consistency**: Reinforced "learning through play" positioning

**Results:**
By 2015, Lego became the world's largest toy company by revenue, surpassing Mattel. Brand value grew from near-zero to over $7 billion.

**Exhibit A: Financial Performance**
```
Year        Revenue      Operating Profit
2004        $1.0B        -$240M (loss)
2010        $2.8B        $640M
2015        $5.2B        $1.5B
2020        $7.0B        $1.8B
```

```
Failed Extensions (Pre-2004):
- Legoland Theme Parks (divested)
- Lego Clothing Line (discontinued)
- Lego Watches (scaled back)
- Galidor action figures (discontinued)
- Jack Stone simplified figures (discontinued)

Successful Extensions (Post-2004):
- Licensed themes (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel)
- The Lego Movie franchise
- Lego Ideas (crowdsourced products)
- Lego Architecture (adult line)
- Lego Technic (advanced building)
- Legoland Discovery Centers (experience)
```

**Exhibit C: Brand Positioning**
```
Target: Children 5-12, but expanded to include adult fans

Brand Essence: "Learning through creative play"

Key Associations:
- Creativity and imagination
- Quality and durability
- Unlimited possibilities
- Nostalgia and heritage
- Educational value

Competitive Set:
- Traditional toys (Mattel, Hasbro)
- Video games
- Streaming entertainment
- Other construction toys
```

- Complementary product (watches and sunglasses are both accessories)
- Low dilution risk
- Recommendation: Proceed with extension

**Budget Smartphones (2.5 points):**
- Low fit: Different category, conflicting price positioning

**Q20. Distinctive Brand Assets (5 points)**

**Definition (2 points):**
Distinctive brand assets are unique brand elements that trigger brand recognition without the brand name being present. They create mental shortcuts and increase mental availability.

Use when:
- Products share common positioning
- Target markets overlap
- Marketing efficiency is priority

Example: Google (Search, Maps, Cloud—all share innovation, simplicity positioning)

### Section C: Case Analysis

**Salience/Identity (2 points):**
- Maintained strong awareness through heritage and iconic product
- Reinforced distinctive assets (brick design, colors, logo)
- The Lego Movie dramatically increased salience with new audiences

**Performance and Imagery (3 points):**
- Performance: Improved product quality, reduced complexity, focused on core building experience

- Licensed themes (Star Wars) added cultural relevance while maintaining brand meaning

- Attachment: Emotional connection across generations

**Q23. Extension Strategy (10 points)**

**Pre-2004 Failures (4 points):**
- **Low fit**: Extensions like clothing and watches had weak connection to core building experience
- **Overextension**: Too many simultaneous extensions diluted brand meaning
- **No leverage**: Galidor and Jack Stone abandoned the brick system, losing core competency transfer
- **Brand dilution**: "What does Lego stand for?" became unclear

**Post-2004 Success (4 points):**
- **High fit**: Licensed themes (Star Wars) maintained brick-building at core
- **Selective extension**: Careful evaluation before entering new categories
- **Leverage transfer**: Architecture and Technic extended building expertise to new audiences
- **Protected core**: All extensions reinforced creative building, not just Lego name

**Theory Application (2 points):**
- Early extensions failed the fit test and caused dilution
- Later extensions passed fit test (product and image), leveraged brand meaning, and protected against dilution by keeping building central

**Q24. Brand Architecture (10 points)**

**Architecture Model (4 points):**
Lego uses a **branded house with sub-brands** model:
- Master brand (Lego) is always present and prominent
- Sub-brands (Lego Star Wars, Lego Technic, Lego City) denote product lines
- Licensed properties are co-brands but Lego remains primary

**Rationale (3 points):**
- Maximum leverage: Lego equity applies to all products
- Efficiency: Single brand to build and maintain
- Clarity: Consumers know what to expect
- Synergy: Success in one line benefits whole brand

**Licensed Property Balance (3 points):**
- Lego name always comes first (Lego Star Wars, not Star Wars Lego)
- Licensed themes are refreshed (Harry Potter returned after gap)
- Original themes (Ninjago, City) maintain brand independence
- Risk management: Not over-dependent on any single license

**Q25. Strategic Recommendations (10 points)**

**Recommendation 1: Sustainability Leadership (3.5 points)**

Strategic Rationale:
- Preempt growing criticism of plastic toys
- Align with parent purchase values
- Create differentiation vs. competitors

Actions:
- Accelerate sustainable materials development

Risks:

**Recommendation 2: Digital-Physical Integration (3.5 points)**

Strategic Rationale:
- Bridge physical play with digital engagement
- Compete with screen time
- Extend play experience beyond the brick

Actions:
- Augmented reality features built into sets
- Companion apps that enhance (not replace) building
- Digital-to-physical products (design online, build real)

Risks:
- May alienate traditional play advocates
- Digital quality must match brand standards
- Cannibalization of core products

Success Metrics:
- Digital engagement rates
- Physical-digital product revenue
- Time spent in play ecosystem

**Recommendation 3: Adult Fan Expansion (3 points)**

Strategic Rationale:
