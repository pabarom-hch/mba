## Answer Key

### Section 1: Psychological Processes

**Question 1: Perception and Attention**

a) Luxury watch sensory marketing (4 points):
- **Vision:** Premium packaging, elegant display, high-quality imagery
- **Sound:** Subtle ticking sound, satisfying clasp click
- **Touch:** Weighty metal, smooth leather band, quality materials
- **Smell:** Leather scent, store ambient fragrance
- **Taste:** N/A directly, but champagne at events, premium experience

b) Weber's Law (4 points):
Weber's Law states that the just noticeable difference (JND) is proportional to the original stimulus intensity.

**Below JND:** Price increases, ingredient reductions—small changes consumers won't notice
**Above JND:** Product improvements, feature additions—changes consumers should perceive

---

**Question 2: Learning and Memory**

a) Classical conditioning in advertising (3 points):
- **US (Unconditioned Stimulus):** Celebrity (e.g., attractive, successful athlete)
- **UR (Unconditioned Response):** Positive feelings, admiration
- **NS → CS (Conditioned Stimulus):** Brand shown with celebrity
- **CR (Conditioned Response):** Positive feelings toward brand

b) Starbucks associative network (3 points):
Nodes: Starbucks → Coffee → Premium → Third place → Community → Green logo → Seasonal drinks → Personalization
Unique: Third place, green logo, seasonal drinks
Generic: Coffee, premium

c) Forgetting curve strategies (3 points):
- **Repetition:** Multiple exposures over time
- **Spacing:** Distributed rather than massed exposure
- **Distinctiveness:** Memorable, unique brand assets
- **Emotional engagement:** Stronger emotional memories
- **Consistency:** Same brand cues reinforce memory

---

**Question 3: Motivation and Attitudes**

a) Maslow application (4 points):
- **Fire extinguisher:** Safety needs (protection, security)
- **Designer handbag:** Esteem needs (status, recognition) and potentially self-actualization (self-expression)
Same person can operate at multiple levels simultaneously; different purchases address different needs.

b) ELM application (4 points):
- **Luxury car (high involvement):** Central route—detailed features, performance data, quality evidence, expert reviews, test drive experiences
- **Chewing gum (low involvement):** Peripheral route—catchy jingle, attractive packaging, celebrity endorsement, simple emotional appeal

---

### Section 2: Decision Making and Behavioral Economics

**Question 4: Cognitive Biases**

a) "Only 3 left" = **Scarcity** - Limited availability increases perceived value
b) "Compare at $200" = **Anchoring** - Original price anchors perception, discount seems larger
c) "Most popular choice" = **Social proof** - People follow what others choose
d) "Deadline Friday" = **Loss aversion** - Fear of missing out on opportunity
e) "10 million customers" = **Social proof** + **Bandwagon effect** - Safety in numbers

---

**Question 5: Choice Architecture**

a) Decoy pricing (4 points):
- Basic: $10/month (limited features)
- Plus: $25/month (most features, designed as target)
- Decoy: $22/month (similar to Basic, slightly better)
- Premium: $30/month (all features)

The Plus tier looks attractive compared to the Decoy. Premium creates an anchor making Plus seem reasonable.

b) Three nudges (4 points):
1. **Default selection:** Pre-select premium tier
2. **Social proof:** "Most businesses choose Premium"
3. **Framing:** Show monthly cost but annual value comparison
4. **Loss framing:** "Upgrade to Premium to avoid missing these features"
