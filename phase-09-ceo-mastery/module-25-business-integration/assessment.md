---

## Part B: CEO Decision Scenarios (30 Points)

### Instructions
For each scenario, provide your recommendation and explain your reasoning. Consider multiple stakeholder perspectives and identify trade-offs. Each scenario is worth 5 points.

---

### Scenario 1: The Strategic Dilemma

**Situation**: You are CEO of a mid-sized B2B software company ($200M revenue, $20M EBITDA). A larger competitor has approached you with an acquisition offer at a 40% premium to your current valuation. At the same time, your board is considering a major strategic pivot to enter the AI market, which would require significant investment and temporarily reduce profitability.

Your head of product believes the AI pivot could triple the company's value in 5 years if successful. Your CFO notes that 60% of such pivots fail. Your largest investor (30% ownership) is neutral but concerned about execution risk. Several key employees have indicated they might leave if you sell.

**Question**: What is your recommendation, and how would you communicate it to the board, employees, and the acquirer?

---

### Scenario 2: The Ethics Challenge

**Situation**: You are CEO of a pharmaceutical company. Your R&D team has discovered that one of your blockbuster drugs ($400M annual revenue, 30% of company revenue) has a previously unknown side effect that causes serious harm in approximately 1 in 10,000 patients. This rate is below the threshold requiring FDA reporting, and competitive drugs have similar or worse safety profiles.

Your General Counsel advises that you have no legal obligation to disclose. Your Chief Medical Officer believes disclosure is the ethical choice. Your CFO warns that voluntary disclosure could cost $200M+ in legal liability and would likely halve the stock price. Some board members are pressuring you to stay quiet.

**Question**: What do you do, and how do you manage the various stakeholder concerns?

---

### Scenario 3: The Turnaround Triage

**Situation**: You are the new CEO of a struggling retailer with 500 stores. The company is losing $10M monthly and has 8 months of runway. Initial analysis suggests three paths:

- **Option A**: Close 200 underperforming stores immediately (save $80M annually, lay off 3,000 workers, break union contracts, signal weakness)
- **Option B**: Sell the company's profitable e-commerce division ($150M, extend runway to 18 months, lose fastest-growing segment)
- **Option C**: Pursue emergency financing ($100M at 15% interest, dilutes shareholders 30%, gives creditors board seats)

The union is threatening strikes if you close stores. Landlords are demanding lease modifications. Key suppliers are threatening to stop shipping on credit.

**Question**: Which option (or combination) do you recommend, and what would you do in the first 30 days?

---

### Scenario 4: The People Decision

**Situation**: You are CEO of a technology company. Your head of sales (reporting to you) has consistently delivered 120%+ of quota for five years and is responsible for relationships with your top 10 customers. However, multiple credible complaints have surfaced about their abusive management style. Two promising managers have resigned citing this leader's behavior, and your CHRO has documented a pattern of intimidation.

The sales leader has apologized and committed to change. They have a $2M retention bonus vesting in 6 months. Firing them risks losing $50M in renewals. Your executive coach advises that people rarely change fundamental behaviors.

**Question**: What is your decision, and how would you implement it?

---

### Scenario 5: The Innovation Investment

**Situation**: You are CEO of an industrial company with stable but slow-growing core business ($1B revenue, 12% EBITDA margin). Your innovation team has developed a breakthrough technology that could disrupt your industry. Market testing shows strong customer interest.

To scale this innovation, you need to invest $150M over 3 years. This would reduce your EBITDA margin to 7% temporarily. Your largest shareholder (activist investor with 15% stake) is pushing for cost cuts and share buybacks instead. Several sell-side analysts have warned they will downgrade the stock if margins compress.

Your competitor is also working on similar technology and might beat you to market if you don't invest aggressively.

**Question**: How do you balance short-term shareholder pressure with long-term strategic investment?

---

### Scenario 6: The Crisis Response

**Situation**: You are CEO of a food company. This morning, you learned that a contamination issue has made approximately 50 people sick across three states. The FDA is investigating. The source has been traced to one of your manufacturing facilities.

Media coverage is intensifying. Your stock is down 15% in pre-market trading. Your crisis communications team recommends a holding statement while legal assesses liability. Your head of quality recommends an immediate voluntary recall of all products from the affected facility ($80M cost). The facility manager insists the contamination was limited and a full recall is unnecessary.

You have a board call in 2 hours and a press conference scheduled for 4 PM.

**Question**: What actions do you take in the next 6 hours, and what do you say publicly?

---

## Part C: Comprehensive Case Analysis (30 Points)

### Instructions
Read the following case and provide a comprehensive analysis addressing all questions. Your response should demonstrate integration of concepts from all phases of the MBA program.

---

## Case: Pinnacle Technologies Transformation

### Background

Pinnacle Technologies is a 40-year-old enterprise software company headquartered in Austin, Texas. The company provides mission-critical software solutions for manufacturing and supply chain operations to Fortune 500 companies worldwide.

**Financial Summary (Current Year)**:
- Revenue: $850M (flat vs. prior year)
- Gross Margin: 72%
- Operating Margin: 15%
- Net Income: $95M
- Maintenance Revenue: 60% of total (highly profitable)
- License Revenue: 25% of total (declining)
- Services: 15% of total (low margin)
- Employees: 3,200
- Debt: $200M (bank facility, 2x EBITDA leverage)
- Cash: $120M

**Market Position**:
Pinnacle is the #2 player in its market with 22% share. The leader (Oracle) has 35% share. Three smaller competitors split the remaining 43%. The market was growing 3% annually but growth has accelerated to 8% as companies invest in digital supply chains.

### Strategic Challenge

Pinnacle faces a classic disruption threat. Cloud-native competitors (including well-funded startups) are offering subscription-based solutions at lower upfront cost with faster implementation. These solutions target the same customers with "good enough" functionality and superior user experience.

**Customer Feedback**:
- "Pinnacle's product is powerful but complex and expensive to maintain"
- "Implementation takes 18 months; the new players promise 6 months"
- "Our users prefer the modern interfaces of the newer tools"
- "We're not renewing unless Pinnacle gets to the cloud"

**Competitive Intelligence**:
- 3 major customers (8% of revenue) have already decided not to renew
- 15 more (22% of revenue) are evaluating alternatives
- Win rate for new deals has dropped from 40% to 25% in two years

### The Cloud Transition

Pinnacle's board has mandated a cloud transformation. The company has two options:

**Option A: "Lift and Shift"**
- Move existing application to cloud infrastructure
- Cost: $80M over 3 years
- Timeline: 2 years to full migration
- Maintains current functionality
- Does not address UX or architecture concerns
- Lower risk, faster time to market

**Option B: "Rebuild Native"**
- Build new cloud-native platform from scratch
- Cost: $180M over 4 years
- Timeline: 3 years for competitive product
- Modern architecture and UX
- Opportunity to leapfrog competitors
- Higher risk, potentially transformative

### People and Organization

The current workforce has limited cloud skills:
- Only 15% of engineers have cloud development experience
- Average employee tenure: 12 years
- Engineering leaders are invested in the existing architecture
- Sales team compensated on license deals (not subscription)
- Customer success function is understaffed

Key leadership positions:
- CTO has been with company 18 years; built the current product; skeptical of cloud
- Chief Revenue Officer is strong but struggling with the transition to subscription model
- No Chief Product Officer role exists
- CFO is traditional; limited technology industry experience

### The Board

The board is divided:
- Founder (10% owner, Board Chair): Prefers conservative approach; protective of legacy
- PE Firm (35% owner): Wants aggressive transformation; impatient for results
- Independent directors: Mixed views; concerned about execution risk

The PE firm acquired their stake 3 years ago expecting 20% IRR. They are becoming frustrated with slow progress and have suggested bringing in "transformation experts."

### Financial Pressures

The transition will pressure financials:
- Subscription revenue is recognized ratably (vs. upfront for licenses)
- Customer migrations will temporarily reduce revenue
- Significant investment required during transition
- Risk of losing more customers before new product is ready
- Analysts expect 5% revenue growth and maintaining current margins

Maintaining the status quo is not viable:
- Without transformation, company will lose 30%+ of customers over 5 years
- Market will increasingly favor cloud-native competitors
- Best engineering talent is leaving for cloud-focused companies

5. How should Pinnacle fund the transformation? Analyze the capital structure implications and recommend a financing approach.

6. Build a simple 3-year financial model showing the expected trajectory under your recommended approach (provide key assumptions and projected revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow).

**C. People and Organization (6 points)**

7. What organizational changes are needed to execute the transformation? What new capabilities and roles are required?

8. How should the CEO address the current leadership team, particularly the CTO who built the existing product and is skeptical of change?

10. Develop a detailed 12-month implementation roadmap for your recommended approach. What are the key milestones and decision gates?

11. How do you manage the customer base during the transition? What communication and migration strategy would you recommend?

12. What are the biggest risks to successful transformation, and how would you mitigate them?

**E. Governance and Stakeholders (4 points)**

13. How do you navigate the board dynamics between the conservative founder and the aggressive PE firm? What governance mechanisms would help?

14. If the PE firm pushes for a sale of the company instead of transformation, how would you evaluate this option and advise the board?

## Answer Key: Part A

### Question 1
**Model Answer**: The company should use marginal cost pricing while ensuring total revenue covers fixed costs. The economic concept is natural monopoly/economies of scale - high fixed costs mean average cost declines with volume, favoring large players who can spread fixed costs. This explains telecommunications, utilities, and platform businesses' tendency toward consolidation.

### Question 2
**Model Answer**: Accounting profit = Revenue - Explicit costs. Economic profit = Revenue - (Explicit + Implicit costs, including opportunity cost of capital). A company can have positive accounting profit but negative economic profit if returns don't exceed the cost of capital. Management should either improve returns above cost of capital or return capital to shareholders.

### Question 3
**Model Answer**: Select Project B with higher NPV ($8M vs. $5M). When projects are mutually exclusive, NPV maximizes shareholder value. IRR can mislead when comparing projects of different size or timing. The IRR vs. NPV conflict typically occurs when projects have different scales or reinvestment assumptions.

### Question 4
**Model Answer**: Adjustments needed: (1) Growth premium - high-growth companies deserve higher multiples; (2) Margin differences - normalize for profitability variations; (3) Capital intensity - adjust for different investment requirements; (4) Risk profile - consider business model maturity and customer concentration; (5) Size premium - larger companies typically command premium multiples.

### Question 5
**Model Answer**: "Stuck in the middle" companies fail to achieve either lowest cost or clear differentiation, resulting in below-average profitability. Companies can pursue both only when: (1) Competitors are also stuck in the middle; (2) Cost is not primarily driven by volume/scale; (3) The company has innovation that simultaneously improves cost and differentiation (like Toyota's manufacturing system); (4) The company can separate segments through different business units.

### Question 6
**Model Answer**: Better-off test: Do the businesses perform better together than separately? Ownership test: Does the parent add more value than other possible owners? Best-owner test: Is this parent the best possible owner, or would another parent add more value? To evaluate divestiture: assess whether synergies exceed costs of ownership, whether strategic focus improves without the unit, and whether sale proceeds exceed value of keeping the business.

### Question 7
**Model Answer**: CLV is the present value of future cash flows from a customer relationship. Marketing ROI framework: acquire customers when CAC < CLV. The CLV/CAC ratio should typically exceed 3x. CLV informs acquisition spending limits, customer segment prioritization, and retention investment levels. Companies should allocate more acquisition spending to high-CLV segments.

### Question 8
**Model Answer**: The innovator's dilemma: successful companies fail because they rationally focus on current customers and existing profit pools, while disruptors target overlooked segments with "good enough" solutions that improve over time. Companies avoid this through: (1) Separate organizations for disruptive innovation; (2) Different metrics for new ventures; (3) Executive sponsorship of disruption projects; (4) Acquisition of disruptors.

### Question 9
**Model Answer**: Theory of Constraints focuses on system bottlenecks rather than overall efficiency. Key insight: improving non-constraint resources doesn't improve system throughput. Five focusing steps: (1) Identify the constraint; (2) Exploit the constraint (maximize its utilization); (3) Subordinate everything else to the constraint; (4) Elevate the constraint (invest to increase capacity); (5) Repeat (the constraint will shift). This differs from traditional approaches that try to improve efficiency everywhere.

### Question 10
**Model Answer**: Bullwhip effect: demand variability amplification as orders move upstream in supply chain. Causes: demand forecast updating, order batching, price fluctuations, rationing. Mitigations: (1) Information sharing (sharing POS data with suppliers); (2) Channel alignment (everyday low pricing, reducing promotions); (3) Operational efficiency (smaller, more frequent orders, vendor-managed inventory); (4) Collaborative planning (CPFR with partners).

### Question 11
**Model Answer**: Transactional leadership: focuses on exchanges, rewards/punishments, supervision, and maintaining the status quo. Transformational leadership: inspires through vision, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration, and idealized influence. Transactional works for stable operations, efficiency, and clear tasks. Transformational needed for change, innovation, and crisis. In turnaround: CEO must use transactional initially (clear targets, accountability) then shift to transformational (vision, culture change) as stability returns.

### Question 12
**Model Answer**: Psychological safety: belief that one won't be punished for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes. Leader behaviors: (1) Acknowledge fallibility ("I might miss something"); (2) Invite participation actively; (3) Respond constructively to bad news and mistakes; (4) Frame failure as learning; (5) Model curiosity over certainty. Psychological safety enables innovation (people share ideas) and learning (people admit mistakes and improve).

### Question 13
**Model Answer**: Winner's curse: winning bidders systematically overpay because only optimists win competitive auctions. Mitigation practices: (1) Disciplined valuation with conservative assumptions; (2) Synergy haircuts (assume only 50-70% of projected synergies); (3) Walk-away price established before auction; (4) Red team to challenge deal thesis; (5) Contingent consideration (earnouts) to shift risk; (6) Independent fairness opinions.

### Question 14
**Model Answer**: Multidomestic: decentralized, locally adapted products/operations (food, retail). Global: centralized, standardized offerings (semiconductors, aircraft). Transnational: integrates global efficiency with local responsiveness (pharmaceuticals). Factors: industry economics (global scale benefits vs. local adaptation needs), customer preferences (global vs. local), regulatory environment, and organizational capabilities.

### Question 15
**Model Answer**: Technology adoption lifecycle: Innovators (2.5%) → Early Adopters (13.5%) → Early Majority (34%) → Late Majority (34%) → Laggards (16%). The "chasm" exists between Early Adopters and Early Majority. Early Adopters accept incomplete products and value innovation. Early Majority want whole products, references, and risk reduction. Products fail when companies cannot cross from visionary customers to pragmatic mainstream customers. Crossing requires: (1) Focus on single target segment; (2) Whole product solution; (3) References and proof points; (4) Simplified value proposition.

### Question 16
**Model Answer**: Risk transfer: shift risk to another party (insurance, contracts, hedging). Example: buying property insurance. Risk avoidance: eliminate the activity creating risk. Example: not entering an unstable market. Risk mitigation: reduce probability or impact. Example: diversification, safety systems, backup plans. Risk acceptance: retain risk deliberately. Example: self-insurance for small, frequent losses. Choice depends on: risk severity, cost of alternatives, risk appetite, and strategic importance of the activity.

### Question 17
**Model Answer**: Technical problems: clear definition, known solution, can be solved by experts with authority. Adaptive challenges: require learning, challenge values/beliefs, require people to change themselves. Technical approach: diagnose, prescribe, implement. Adaptive approach: identify the adaptive challenge, regulate distress, direct attention to issues, protect voices of leadership from below, give work back to the people. CEO error: treating adaptive challenges as technical problems.

### Question 18
**Model Answer**: Agency problem: managers (agents) may pursue own interests rather than shareholders' (principals). Alignment mechanisms: (1) Executive compensation (stock options, performance bonuses align interests); (2) Board oversight (independent directors monitor management); (3) Market for corporate control (takeover threat disciplines management); (4) Shareholder activism (active owners hold management accountable); (5) Debt (constrains discretionary spending); (6) Auditing and disclosure (transparency enables monitoring).

### Question 19
**Model Answer**: Four paradoxes: Learning (exploit vs. explore), Belonging (individual vs. collective), Organizing (control vs. flexibility), Performing (multiple stakeholder demands). Both/and thinking: accepts that tensions are permanent, seeks to pursue both poles simultaneously, uses separation (temporal, structural) or synthesis, focuses on dynamic equilibrium rather than static resolution. Traditional problem-solving assumes one answer; paradox management assumes ongoing navigation.

### Question 20
**Model Answer**: First 100 days critical because: maximum attention/goodwill but minimum knowledge; sets trajectory for tenure; establishes credibility and leadership brand. Focus areas: (1) Days 1-30: Listen and learn (stakeholder meetings, organizational assessment); (2) Days 31-60: Diagnose and plan (assess team, identify priorities, develop direction); (3) Days 61-100: Decide and act (communicate direction, make team decisions, launch initiatives). Key: balance learning with action; build relationships; achieve early wins; avoid common traps.
