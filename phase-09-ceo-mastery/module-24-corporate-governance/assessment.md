### Section B: Short Answer (30 points)

**21. Director Duties (6 points)**

**Model Answer:**

**Duty of Care** (2 points): Requires directors to act as a reasonably prudent person would in similar circumstances, making informed decisions.
- *Violation example*: Approving a major acquisition without reading the due diligence materials or asking substantive questions.

**Duty of Loyalty** (2 points): Requires directors to put the company's interests above their personal interests and avoid conflicts of interest.
- *Violation example*: Voting to approve a contract with a company owned by the director's family member without disclosing the relationship.

**Duty of Good Faith** (2 points): Requires directors to act honestly and with proper purpose, not consciously disregarding their duties.
- *Violation example*: Knowingly allowing the company to violate environmental regulations to save costs.

---

**22. Internal Control Deficiencies (5 points)**

**Model Answer:**

**Significant Deficiency** (2 points): A deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness but merits attention by those responsible for oversight. It represents a reasonable possibility that a more-than-inconsequential misstatement could occur and not be prevented or detected.
- *Disclosure*: Must be reported to the audit committee; not required to be publicly disclosed.

**Material Weakness** (2 points): A deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
- *Disclosure*: Must be publicly disclosed in the company's annual report and results in an adverse opinion on internal controls from the auditor.

*Key distinction* (1 point): The difference is the severity and likelihood of resulting misstatement - material weakness is more severe and relates to material misstatements.

---

**23. Compensation Alignment (5 points)**

**Model Answer (any three of the following, ~1.5 points each):**

1. **Performance Share Units with relative TSR metrics**: Ties executive wealth directly to shareholder returns relative to peers, ensuring executives only benefit when outperforming the market.

2. **Stock ownership requirements** (e.g., 6x salary for CEO): Requires executives to hold significant equity, creating permanent alignment and discouraging short-term risk-taking.

3. **Multi-year performance periods** (3+ years): Extends the time horizon over which performance is measured, reducing incentives to sacrifice long-term value for short-term results.

4. **Clawback policies**: Allows recovery of incentive compensation if financial results are restated or misconduct is discovered, reducing moral hazard.

5. **Post-vesting holding requirements**: Requires executives to hold shares for a period after vesting, extending alignment beyond the performance period.

---

**24. ESG Materiality (6 points)**

**Model Answer:**

**Technology Company** (3 points):
1. *Data privacy and security*: Tech companies collect and store vast amounts of personal data; breaches can result in regulatory fines, litigation, and reputational damage.
2. *Human capital/DEI*: Competition for talent is intense; diversity drives innovation; public scrutiny of workforce composition is high.

**Oil & Gas Company** (3 points):
1. *GHG emissions and climate transition risk*: Core business model is directly impacted by energy transition; regulatory and physical risks are material.
2. *Health and safety*: Operations are inherently dangerous; incidents can result in fatalities, environmental damage, and operational shutdown.

---

**25. Activist Response (8 points)**

**Model Answer:**

**Day 1-3:**
- Convene board meeting (special session if needed)
- Notify and engage legal counsel (with proxy contest experience)
- Engage investment bank for defense advisory
- Preliminary assessment of activist's thesis and shareholder base
- Do not respond publicly immediately

**Day 4-7:**
- Board discussion of activist's demands on merits
- Engage proxy solicitor for shareholder intelligence
- Begin outreach to top 10-15 shareholders to gauge sentiment
- Prepare internal analysis of company's strategic plan vs. activist's proposals
- Consider engaging with activist privately (listening session)

**Week 2:**
- Develop formal response strategy (negotiate, settle, or prepare to fight)
- Prepare materials for shareholder outreach
- Consider proactive announcements (if company has pending initiatives)
- Formulate potential settlement parameters if applicable
- Begin regular board updates on situation

---

### Section C: Case Analysis (30 points)

**Question 1: Vulnerability Assessment (8 points)**

**Model Answer:**

**HIGH VULNERABILITY FACTORS:**
- Significant underperformance (-12% TSR vs. +35% peers) - provides compelling thesis
- Operating margins (8% vs. 14%) and ROIC (6% vs. 12%) well below peers
- Underleveraged balance sheet (0.5x vs. 2.0x) - excess cash potential
- Conglomerate discount likely - consumer products division appears undervalued
- Long board tenure (14 years avg) - entrenchment concern
- CEO tenure 10 years with declining performance
- Combined CEO/Chair - governance concern
- CEO pay at 75th percentile with below-median performance - pay disconnect
- Failed acquisition track record
- Activist already has significant stake (8.5%)
- Declining say-on-pay support (72%, down from 91%)
- ISS already expressing concerns

**FACTORS FAVORING COMPANY:**
- Large company ($15B) - harder to fully control
- No immediate liquidity crisis
- Institutional ownership concentrated (top 10 = 55%) - could go either way

**Overall Assessment**: HIGH vulnerability - activist has strong case on multiple fronts

---

**Question 2: Demand Evaluation (10 points)**

| Demand | Recommendation | Reasoning |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| 1. Spin off consumer products | **Negotiate** | Valid case for unlocking value (potential $4-5B value creation at 10-12x EBITDA); consider strategic alternatives review but don't commit to specific outcome |
| 2. Three new directors | **Negotiate** | Board refreshment is overdue; accept 1-2 seats (mutually agreed candidates, not activist nominees); use this as opportunity for board modernization |
| 3. Separate CEO/Chair | **Accept** | Good governance practice; proactively address before it becomes issue; appoint strong lead independent director if not already separating |
| 4. 25% comp reduction | **Reject/Negotiate** | Arbitrary number, but should address pay-for-performance alignment; offer to restructure compensation to be more performance-contingent |
| 5. $3B share repurchase | **Negotiate** | Given underleveraged balance sheet, some capital return warranted; amount should be based on capital needs analysis, not arbitrary target |
| 6. Replace CEO in 12 months | **Reject** | Inappropriate for activist to dictate CEO succession timeline; board should evaluate CEO performance but maintain authority over this decision |

---

**Question 3: Response Strategy (12 points)**

**Model Answer:**

**a) Immediate Actions (72 hours):**
- Emergency board meeting
- Retain advisors (investment bank, legal, proxy solicitor, PR)
- Brief all directors on situation and demands
- Acknowledge receipt of letter; commit to careful review
- Begin shareholder intelligence gathering
- Do NOT respond defensively in public

**b) Stakeholder Engagement Plan (Weeks 1-4):**
- Proactive outreach to top 20 shareholders
- Management and board members participate
- Listen to shareholder concerns; gauge support
- Prepare updated strategic plan presentation
- Address ISS/Glass Lewis concerns proactively
- Consider operational improvements to announce
- Employee communication about situation
- Engage with Catalyst for constructive dialogue

**c) Settlement Framework:**
Given high vulnerability, settlement is advisable. Proposed terms:
- 2 board seats (one activist nominee, one mutually agreed independent)
- Commit to strategic alternatives review of consumer products (12-month timeline)
- Separate CEO/Chair within 6 months
- Announce capital allocation review (potential for enhanced returns)
- Standstill agreement (18-24 months)
- Do NOT agree to CEO replacement or specific repurchase amount

**d) Defense Preparation (if settlement fails):**
- Develop proxy contest materials and messaging
- Identify and vet additional director candidates
- Prepare detailed strategic plan presentation
- Analyst/investor day to present company story
- Secure ISS/Glass Lewis meetings
- Prepare response to activist public statements
- Consider announcing governance improvements proactively
