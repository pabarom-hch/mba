## Discussion Questions

### Question 1: Engagement Profitability Analysis

Calculate the following for the engagement data in Exhibit 1:
1. Blended margin across all engagements
2. Revenue-weighted average margin
3. Rank engagements by margin contribution

Which engagement type is most profitable? Which should the firm prioritize?

### Question 2: Revenue Model Optimization

Using Exhibit 2, analyze the revenue model mix:
1. If the firm shifted 10% of staffing revenue to managed services, what would be the margin impact?
2. What barriers might prevent this shift?
3. Design a 12-month transition plan.

### Question 3: Rate Card Economics

Using Exhibit 4, answer:
1. Calculate the annual revenue potential for each role at target utilization
2. Why do senior roles have lower margins but higher revenue per FTE?
3. What is the optimal mix of junior/mid/senior staff for maximizing margins vs. revenue?

### Question 4: Variance Analysis

January showed a -15% revenue variance (Exhibit 5):
1. What factors might explain this shortfall?
2. What questions would you ask management?
3. What corrective actions would you recommend?

### Question 5: Portfolio Strategy

Based on all exhibits, recommend:
1. Which vertical(s) should receive increased investment?
2. Which revenue model should be prioritized?
3. How should the firm balance margin vs. revenue goals?

## Consulting Approach

### Unit Economics Framework

```
Revenue per Engagement
        │
        ├── Bill Rate × Hours = Gross Revenue
        │   └── Utilization drives actual hours
        │
        ├── Cost Structure
        │   ├── Labor Cost (fully loaded)
        │   ├── ODC (direct costs)
        │   └── Overhead allocation
        │
        └── Contribution Margin
            └── Gross Profit / Revenue
```

### Key Metrics for Professional Services

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Utilization Rate | Billable Hours / Available Hours | 70-80% |
| Realization Rate | Billed Revenue / Potential Revenue | 90%+ |
| Gross Margin | (Revenue - Direct Cost) / Revenue | 30-40% |
| Revenue per FTE | Annual Revenue / Headcount | $150-250K |
| Revenue per Partner | Partner revenue responsibility | $1-3M |

### Margin Improvement Levers

1. **Rate Optimization** - Increase bill rates where market allows
2. **Utilization Improvement** - Reduce bench time
3. **Mix Shift** - Move to higher-margin service models
4. **Cost Reduction** - Improve labor cost efficiency
5. **ODC Management** - Better control of direct costs

## Teaching Note

### Key Learning Objectives

1. **Understand professional services economics** - Revenue = Rate × Hours × Utilization
2. **Apply margin analysis** - Calculate and interpret contribution margins
3. **Conduct variance analysis** - Diagnose performance gaps
4. **Make portfolio decisions** - Optimize service and vertical mix

### Quantitative Exercises

**Exercise 1: Margin Impact Calculation**
If Managed Services grows from 8% to 18% of revenue (shifting from Premium Staffing):
- Current: ($180K × 35%) + ($1.45M × 22.5%) = $63K + $326K = $389K gross profit
- Proposed: ($396K × 35%) + ($1.234M × 22.5%) = $139K + $278K = $417K gross profit
- **Impact: +$28K annual gross profit (+7.2%)**

**Exercise 2: Utilization Sensitivity**
If utilization improves from 75% to 80% for a $150K/year consultant:
- Current billable: 1,560 hours × $150 = $234K revenue
- Improved billable: 1,664 hours × $150 = $250K revenue
- **Impact: +$16K revenue per consultant**
