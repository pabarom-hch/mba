## Exhibit 6: Strategic Analysis

### SWOT Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Public Health & Healthcare expertise (MD on staff, epidemiologists)
- Data & Analytics capabilities (Power BI, state government experience)

- No dedicated sales function
- "Body shop" positioning vs. value-added consulting

**Threats:**
- Primary client contract could be permanently reduced
- Talent departure during crisis
- Economic downturn affecting government budgets

|------|----------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | $171,015 | $0 | $0 | $171,015 |
| 2 | $171,015 | $0 | $182,000 | -$10,985 |
| 3 | Draw LOC | $150,000 | $18,000 | $121,015 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
