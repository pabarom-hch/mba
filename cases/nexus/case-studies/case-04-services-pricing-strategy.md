## Discussion Questions

### Question 1: Pricing Model Analysis

Analyze the current service mix (Exhibit 1):
1. Calculate the revenue-weighted average margin across all service types
2. If the company shifted from 67% staffing to 50% staffing (moving to managed services), what would be the margin impact?
3. What barriers might prevent this shift?

### Question 2: Rate Card Optimization

Using Exhibit 2:
1. A client needs a blended team of 2 Junior + 2 Mid + 1 Senior SOC analysts for a 12-month engagement (2,000 hours each). Calculate:
   - Blended hourly rate
   - Total engagement revenue
   - Gross profit
   - Team margin %

2. If a competitor offers this team at $130/hr blended, should TechServices match? What's the minimum acceptable rate?

### Question 3: Tier Strategy

Looking at Exhibit 3:
1. Which tier generates the most margin dollars per client?
2. Why might the Strategic tier have lower margins but be valuable?
3. Design a strategy to increase the Premium tier from 3% to 10% of revenue

### Question 4: Competitive Response

A competitor (Exhibit 4) has undercut your SOC Analyst rates by $10/hr:
1. Should you match? Why or why not?
2. How would you differentiate on value instead of price?
3. Draft a client talking point to defend your pricing

### Question 5: Package Design

Using Exhibit 5, analyze the proposed managed services tiers:
1. Calculate the effective hourly rate for each tier at 100% utilization
2. Which tier is most profitable? Why?
3. What would you change about this tier structure?

## Teaching Note

### Key Learning Objectives

1. **Understand professional services pricing** - Multiple models, each with trade-offs
2. **Calculate blended rates** - Mix of seniority levels affects overall economics
3. **Analyze tier structures** - Volume vs. margin trade-offs
4. **Competitive positioning** - When to compete on price vs. value
5. **Package design** - Creating value through bundling

### Quantitative Exercise Solutions

**Blended Rate Calculation:**
- 2 Junior × $125 = $250
- 2 Mid × $140 = $280
- 1 Senior × $150 = $150
- Total: $680 / 5 people = **$136/hr blended**

**Engagement Economics:**
- 5 people × 2,000 hours = 10,000 hours
- Revenue: 10,000 × $136 = $1,360,000
- Cost: (2×$68 + 2×$79 + 1×$90) × 2,000 = $768,000
- Gross Profit: $592,000
- Margin: 43.5%

**Competitor Match Analysis:**
- At $130/hr: 10,000 × $130 = $1,300,000 revenue
- Cost: $768,000
- Gross Profit: $532,000
- Margin: 40.9%
- Decision: Can match if minimum margin is 35%+
