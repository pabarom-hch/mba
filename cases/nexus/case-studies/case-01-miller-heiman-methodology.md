## The Miller Heiman Framework

### Blue Sheet: Strategic Selling

The Blue Sheet is used for complex B2B sales with multiple decision-makers. It analyzes:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Single Sales Objective (SSO) | Define exactly what you're trying to sell |
| Buying Influences | Map all stakeholders involved in the decision |
| Red Flags | Identify risks that could derail the deal |
| Strengths | Leverage points that support your position |
| Competition | Understand competitive landscape |
| Win Strategy | Articulate your path to victory |

### Buying Influences

| Type | Role | Key Question |
|------|------|--------------|
| Economic Buyer | Final approval, releases funds | "Will this investment deliver ROI?" |
| User Buyer | Will use the solution daily | "Will this make my job easier?" |
| Technical Buyer | Screens out options | "Does this meet our requirements?" |
| Coach | Guides you through the process | "How can I help you win this?" |

### Green Sheet: Conceptual Selling

Used for planning individual sales calls with discovery questions:

| Question Type | Purpose | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Confirmation | Verify understanding | "So your current system handles 500 users?" |
| New Information | Discover unknown needs | "What challenges arise during peak periods?" |
| Attitude | Understand feelings | "How do you feel about the current approach?" |
| Commitment | Test readiness to act | "If we solved this, what would the next step be?" |
| Basic Issue | Uncover fundamental concerns | "What's really driving this initiative?" |

## Discussion Questions

### Question 1: Methodology Comparison

Compare the Miller Heiman approach to McKinsey's MECE problem-solving framework. Where do they overlap? Where do they differ? Which aspects might a consulting firm apply to their own sales process?

### Question 2: Buying Influence Analysis

Looking at the State Agency opportunity (Exhibit 2), the Technical Buyer is rated 2/5. Using the Miller Heiman framework:
- What questions would you ask to understand his concerns?
- What actions might improve his stance?
- How would you leverage the Coach to address this?

### Question 3: Motivation Discovery

The Motivation Discovery (Exhibit 3) shows compliance pain scoring 9/10. How would you structure your sales message to address this? Write a 30-second elevator pitch that leads with pain.

### Question 4: ROI of Methodology

Using Exhibit 4, calculate the financial impact of implementing Miller Heiman methodology for a firm with:
- 100 opportunities per year
- $150,000 average deal value
Show the revenue difference between using and not using the methodology.

### Question 5: Pipeline Strategy

Looking at the current pipeline (Exhibit 1), which opportunities should receive the most attention? Use the Blue Sheet framework to prioritize. What should be done for opportunities without Blue Sheets?

## Consulting Approach

### McKinsey vs. Miller Heiman

| Framework | McKinsey MECE | Miller Heiman |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Primary Use | Problem-solving | Sales execution |
| Structure | Issue trees | Buying influence maps |
| Questions | Diagnostic | Relationship-building |
| Output | Recommendations | Deal strategy |
| Overlap | Structured, hypothesis-driven |

### Integration Opportunity

A consulting firm can use BOTH frameworks:
1. **McKinsey** for client problem-solving engagements
2. **Miller Heiman** for winning those engagements in the first place

### Key Insight

The most successful consulting firms apply their analytical rigor to their own sales process. Miller Heiman provides the structure; consulting skills provide the execution quality.

## Teaching Note

### Key Learning Objectives

1. **Understand structured sales methodology** - Sales can be as rigorous as consulting frameworks
2. **Apply buying influence analysis** - Identify and manage all stakeholders
3. **Connect motivation to messaging** - Pain/pleasure discovery drives persuasion
4. **Measure methodology ROI** - Quantify the impact of process discipline

### Common Student Insights

- "I didn't realize sales could be this structured"
- "The buying influence map is like stakeholder analysis for sales"
- "Motivation discovery is similar to customer research"
- "Win rate improvement is dramatic with methodology"

### Discussion Guide

1. Start by asking students about their perception of sales (often negative)
2. Introduce Miller Heiman as "consulting for sales"
3. Work through the Blue Sheet example collaboratively
4. Calculate the ROI to demonstrate business impact
5. Close by connecting to their future CEO roles
