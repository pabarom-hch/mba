<details>
<summary>Show Retention Strategy</summary>

|------------|---------|-------|-----------|
| Principal A | $75K stay bonus (2 yrs), $25K equity grant | $100K | Highest producer, most critical |

### Exercise 3: Rate Card Optimization

Current rate card is inconsistent across practices. Design new standard rates:

**Current State**:

| Role | Healthcare Practice | General IT | Variance |
|------|---------------------|------------|----------|
| Principal | $175/hr | $150/hr | 17% |
| Senior Consultant | $140/hr | $125/hr | 12% |
| Consultant | $110/hr | $95/hr | 16% |
| Junior | $85/hr | $75/hr | 13% |

**Exercise**: Set unified rates that maximize revenue without losing clients:

| Role | New Standard Rate | Revenue Impact |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| Principal | $___/hr | |
| Senior Consultant | $___/hr | |
| Consultant | $___/hr | |
| Junior | $___/hr | |

**Estimated annual revenue lift**: $_______

<details>
<summary>Show Rate Strategy</summary>

| Role | New Rate | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Principal | $165/hr | Converge toward Healthcare, slight discount |
| Senior Consultant | $135/hr | 8% lift from weighted average |
| Consultant | $105/hr | Split the difference |
| Junior | $80/hr | Modest increase |

**Revenue Impact Calculation**:
- Billable hours (85 employees × 72% util × 2,080 hrs): ~127,000 hrs
- Average rate increase: ~$8/hr
- **Annual revenue lift**: ~$1,016,000

Note: Phase in over 90 days for existing contracts, immediate for new work.
