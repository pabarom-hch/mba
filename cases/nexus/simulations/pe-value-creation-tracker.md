| Customer churn rate | 8% | 14% | 5% | Critical |

**D. What Went Wrong: Management Interviews**

From your quarterly operating reviews, you've identified these issues:

1. **VP Sales Departure**: The VP Sales (hired at close) left after 8 months. Position was vacant for 4 months. New hire started 6 months ago but is ramping slowly.

2. **Geographic Expansion Delayed**: Central Florida expansion was delayed due to difficulty finding warehouse space. Lease now signed but won't open until Q2 2026.

3. **M&A Pipeline Dry**: Two acquisition targets fell through (one on price, one on quality). Pipeline is being rebuilt but no LOIs signed.

4. **Warehouse Labor Shortage**: Tight labor market in the region. Forced to use more temporary workers at higher cost. Training quality suffered.

5. **Fuel Cost Spike**: Diesel prices 25% higher than projected. Fleet optimization project delayed as operations focused on day-to-day issues.

6. **Customer Service Issues**: On-time delivery declined, leading to customer complaints. Lost two mid-sized accounts ($3.5M combined revenue).

7. **Working Capital Bleed**: Inventory built up due to demand forecasting errors. AR aged due to billing system issues post-acquisition.

### Exhibit 5: Current Debt Position

### Task 1: Variance Analysis

| Metric | Investment Thesis (18-Mo) | Actual (18-Mo) | Variance ($) | Variance (%) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Revenue (TTM) | $152.0M | $139.5M | $(12.5M) | -8.2% |
| EBITDA (TTM) | $14.4M | $10.49M | $(3.91M) | -27.1% |
| EBITDA Margin | 9.5% | 7.5% | (2.0 pts) | N/A |
| New National Accounts | 8 | 3 | (5) | -62.5% |
| M&A Revenue Added | $15.0M | $0 | $(15.0M) | -100% |
| NWC Change | $(1.5M) | +$2.1M | $(3.6M) | -240% |
| Debt Balance | $26.0M | $33.3M | +$7.3M | +28% |
| Leverage | 1.8x | 3.2x | +1.4x | +78% |

**Key Insight**: The company is significantly behind plan across all metrics. The EBITDA shortfall of $3.9M (27%) is the most concerning as it directly impacts debt paydown capacity and enterprise value.

### Task 2: Root Cause Diagnosis

| Value Lever | Planned | Actual | Gap | Root Cause |
|-------------|---------|--------|-----|------------|
| **Organic Revenue** | +$27M | +$14.5M | $(12.5M) | VP Sales vacancy created 10-month selling disruption. Restaurant segment significantly underperformed (4% vs 12% growth). Lost accounts due to service issues. |
| **National Accounts** | 8 new | 3 new | (5) | Sales leadership gap. No dedicated national accounts team. Lost momentum in pipeline during transition. |
| **EBITDA Margin** | 9.5% | 7.5% | (2.0 pts) | 1) Warehouse labor +1.6% due to turnover/temps. 2) Fleet costs +1.2% due to fuel and delayed optimization. 3) Lower leverage of fixed costs due to revenue miss. |
| **M&A Execution** | 1 deal, $15M | 0 deals | $(15M) | Two deals fell through. Pipeline rebuild taking longer than expected. Distracted by operational issues. |
| **Working Capital** | $(1.5M) | +$2.1M | $(3.6M) | Inventory forecasting errors (+$1.8M). AR aging due to billing issues (+$1.8M). |

**Top 3 Root Causes by Impact:**

1. **Sales Leadership Vacuum** (Impact: ~$8-10M revenue, ~$1.0M EBITDA)
   - 14 months without stable VP Sales
   - No national accounts focus
   - Customer relationships damaged

2. **Operational Execution Gaps** (Impact: ~$2.0M EBITDA)
   - Warehouse labor productivity crisis (52% turnover)
   - Fleet optimization stalled
   - Day-to-day firefighting consumed management attention

3. **M&A Stall** (Impact: $15M revenue, ~$1.5M EBITDA opportunity cost)
   - Pipeline dried up after two failed deals
   - No dedicated M&A resource
   - Geographic expansion delayed

### Task 3: Corrective Actions

| Root Cause | Corrective Action | Owner | Timeline | Expected Impact |
|------------|-------------------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Sales leadership gap | Hire Chief Revenue Officer with national accounts experience. Offer equity incentive. | CEO + Board | 60 days | +$5-7M revenue Year 3 |
| National accounts pipeline | Create dedicated national accounts team (2 FTEs). Develop 20-account target list. | New CRO | 90 days | 5+ new accounts Year 3 |
| Warehouse labor | Implement retention bonuses ($500/quarter). Partner with staffing agency for temp-to-perm pipeline. Wage adjustment (+8%). | COO | 30 days | Reduce turnover to 30% |
| Fleet inefficiency | Hire fleet optimization consultant. Implement route optimization software ($50K). | COO | 90 days | 8-10% fleet cost reduction |
| M&A pipeline | Engage investment bank for proprietary deal sourcing. Allocate CFO 30% time to M&A. | CFO + Board | Immediate | 1-2 LOIs by Q2 2026 |
| Working capital | Implement demand planning software. AR task force with weekly collections meetings. | CFO | 60 days | $2M NWC release |
| Customer service | Institute daily delivery tracking meetings. Customer recovery outreach program. | COO | 30 days | Reduce churn to 8% |

### Task 4: Value Creation Bridge

**Entry to Current Value Bridge**

| Component | Value Impact | Calculation |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Entry EV** | **$65.0M** | 7.5x × $8.67M |
| | | |
| **Value Added:** | | |
| EBITDA Growth (at entry multiple) | +$13.7M | ($10.49M - $8.67M) × 7.5x = $1.82M × 7.5x |
| | | |
| **Value Lost (vs. Plan):** | | |
| Below-plan EBITDA | -$29.3M | ($14.4M - $10.49M) × 7.5x = $3.91M shortfall × 7.5x |
| Working capital deterioration | -$3.6M | $2.1M increase vs. $1.5M planned decrease |
| Unplanned revolver draw | -$1.8M | $6.8M vs. $5.0M at entry |
| | | |
| **Current Implied EV** | **$78.7M** | $10.49M × 7.5x |
| | | |
| **Equity Value:** | | |
| Current EV | $78.7M | |
| Less: Current Debt | $(33.3M) | |
| **Current Implied Equity** | **$45.4M** | |
| | | |
| Entry Equity | $32.0M | |
| **Unrealized Gain** | **$13.4M** | |
| **Current MOIC** | **1.4x** | $45.4M / $32.0M |

**Value vs. Plan at Month 18:**

| Metric | Plan | Actual | Variance |
|--------|------|--------|----------|
| EV | $108M (7.5x × $14.4M) | $78.7M | $(29.3M) |
| Equity | $82M | $45.4M | $(36.6M) |
| MOIC | 2.6x | 1.4x | (1.2x) |

### Task 5: Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Year 5 Revenue | Year 5 EBITDA | Margin | Exit Multiple | Exit EV | Net Debt | Equity | MOIC | IRR |
|----------|----------------|---------------|--------|---------------|---------|----------|--------|------|-----|
| **Original Plan** | $185M | $20.4M | 11.0% | 9.0x | $184M | $15M | $169M | 5.3x | 38% |
| **Current Trajectory** | $162M | $14.6M | 9.0% | 7.5x | $110M | $28M | $82M | 2.6x | 21% |

| **Downside Case** | $145M | $11.6M | 8.0% | 6.5x | $75M | $32M | $43M | 1.3x | 6% |

**Recovery Case Assumptions:**
- Successful CRO hire accelerates national accounts (+5 new accounts)
- One tuck-in acquisition closed ($12M revenue, 10% EBITDA margin)
- Warehouse efficiency improvements achieve 50% of plan
- Working capital normalized (-$1.5M)
- Geographic expansion (Central FL) launches Q2 2026

**Current Trajectory Assumptions:**
- No significant changes to operating model
- Linear growth at current rate
- No M&A
- Margins stay flat at 9%

**Downside Case Assumptions:**
- Restaurant segment continues declining
- Additional customer churn
- Labor cost inflation continues

### Board Presentation Summary

**SunCoast Distribution Holdings**
**Q4 2025 Portfolio Review**

**Status: BEHIND PLAN - INTERVENTION REQUIRED**

**Performance Summary (18 Months)**
| Metric | Plan | Actual | Status |
|--------|------|--------|--------|
| TTM Revenue | $152M | $140M | -8% |
| TTM EBITDA | $14.4M | $10.5M | -27% |
| Margin | 9.5% | 7.5% | -200 bps |
| Leverage | 1.8x | 3.2x | Critical |

**Root Causes:**
1. Sales leadership vacuum (14 months)
2. Operational execution gaps (labor, fleet)
3. M&A pipeline stalled

**Immediate Actions (Board Approval Required):**
1. Authorize CRO search with equity package up to 3% fully diluted
2. Approve $350K operating improvement investment (wage increases, software)
3. Engage investment bank for M&A sourcing ($150K retainer)
4. Quarterly board cadence increased to monthly until recovery confirmed

**Path Forward:**

With corrective actions, Recovery Case projects:
- Year 5 EBITDA: $18.2M
- Exit EV: $155M
- Equity Value: $135M
- **MOIC: 4.2x | IRR: 33%**

Without intervention (Current Trajectory):
- **MOIC: 2.6x | IRR: 21%**

**Recommendation**: Approve intervention package. Investment still has compelling upside but requires immediate action on sales leadership and operational fundamentals.

### Key Learning Points

1. **Early intervention is critical**: The 10-month VP Sales vacancy created a hole that will take 18+ months to fill. Leadership gaps must be filled within 90 days maximum.

2. **Operational improvement is harder than expected**: Margin improvement requires sustained execution focus. One quarter of firefighting can derail a year of progress.

3. **M&A requires dedicated resources**: Part-time M&A attention in a middle-market deal results in a failed pipeline. Either dedicate resources or accept organic-only growth.

4. **Working capital can destroy value quickly**: A $3.6M working capital miss has the same equity impact as $500K of EBITDA at this leverage level.

5. **Track leading indicators**: Customer churn (14% vs. 5% target) and employee turnover (52% vs. 25% target) were warning signs that preceded financial underperformance.
