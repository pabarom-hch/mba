# Covenant Compliance Monitor Simulation

## Debt Management: Alpine Logistics Holdings

**Estimated Time**: 45-60 minutes
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Debt Financing Fundamentals, Financial Statement Analysis

---

## Overview

You are the CFO of Alpine Logistics Holdings, a regional trucking and warehousing company that was acquired by Mountain View Capital Partners in a leveraged buyout 18 months ago. The company has a $45 million senior secured term loan with quarterly financial covenant testing.

Business performance has softened over the past two quarters due to freight market weakness, and you are concerned about potential covenant breaches in the upcoming quarters. You must calculate current covenant ratios, project future compliance, identify potential breaches, and develop remediation strategies.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this simulation, you will be able to:

1. Calculate common financial covenants (leverage ratio, interest coverage, fixed charge coverage)
2. Project covenant compliance using monthly/quarterly financial forecasts
3. Identify potential covenant breaches before they occur
4. Develop remediation strategies to cure or avoid covenant violations
5. Model covenant amendment scenarios and their financial implications
6. Communicate covenant status effectively to lenders and sponsors

- Interest rate increase: +25 bps
- Financial reporting: Monthly (vs. quarterly)
- Required: $2M equity cure from sponsor within 30 days

Calculate the financial impact of this amendment:

| Item | Current | Post-Amendment | Change |
|------|---------|----------------|--------|
| Leverage Covenant | 4.50x | | |
| Interest Rate | 9.50% | | |
| Annual Interest Cost | | | |
| Amendment Fee | | | |
| **Total Year 1 Cost** | | | |

### Task 3: Identify Potential Breaches

**Base Case Breaches:**

| Scenario | Quarter | Covenant | Projected | Required | Shortfall |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Base | Q1 2026 | Leverage | 4.55x | 4.50x | 0.05x ($500K EBITDA) |
| Base | Q2 2026 | Leverage | 4.79x | 4.50x | 0.29x ($2.9M EBITDA) |
| Base | Q3 2026 | Leverage | 4.62x | 4.50x | 0.12x ($1.2M EBITDA) |
| Base | Q1-Q4 2026 | Interest Cov | 2.30-2.49x | 2.50x | 0.01-0.20x |
| Base | Q1-Q4 2026 | FCCR | 0.92-1.02x | 1.10x | 0.08-0.18x |

**Downside Case:** All three covenants breached all four quarters with significant cushion shortfall.

**Most At-Risk Covenant: FCCR**

Rationale:
- FCCR is most sensitive to both EBITDA and CapEx swings
- Current business requires ongoing fleet investment (CapEx)
- Even Base Case shows FCCR breach every quarter
- Downside Case shows severe breach (0.42x vs. 1.10x required)

### Task 4: Remediation Strategies

**Operational Remediation (No Lender Involvement)**

| Strategy | EBITDA Impact | Cash Impact | Feasibility | Timeline |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Reduce fleet maintenance (defer non-critical) | +$200K/qtr | +$200K/qtr | Medium | 30 days |
| Reduce headcount (15 positions) | +$300K/qtr | -$450K (severance) | High | 60 days |
| Defer CapEx (fleet replacement) | $0 | +$400K/qtr | High | Immediate |
| Renegotiate fuel contracts | +$75K/qtr | +$75K/qtr | Medium | 90 days |
| Sublease excess warehouse space | +$125K/qtr | +$125K/qtr | Medium | 120 days |

**Total Operational Impact:** +$700K/qtr EBITDA, +$350K/qtr cash (net of timing)

**Financial Remediation (Requires Sponsor Action)**

| Strategy | EBITDA Impact | Debt Impact | Feasibility | Timeline |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------|

| Sponsor equity cure ($4M) | $0 | -$4.0M debt | Medium | 30 days |
| Subordinated shareholder loan | $0 | Excluded from covenant debt | High | 15 days |
| Sale-leaseback of real estate | +$300K/yr (rent adj) | -$6M debt | Medium | 120 days |
| Asset sale (non-core trucks) | -$100K EBITDA | -$1.5M debt | High | 60 days |

**Lender Remediation (Requires Amendment)**

| Strategy | Terms Change | Lender Benefit | Likelihood | Cost |
|----------|--------------|----------------|------------|------|
| Covenant holiday (2 qtrs) | Suspend testing Q1-Q2 | Monitoring rights | Low | 75-100 bps + fee |
| Covenant reset | Higher thresholds 12 mo | Pricing/security | Medium | 25-50 bps + fee |
| Amortization holiday | Defer principal 12 mo | Cash preservation | Medium | 25 bps |

| Interest Rate | 9.50% | 9.75% | +25 bps |
| Annual Interest Cost | $4,579K | $4,693K | +$114K |
| Amendment Fee (one-time) | $0 | $225K | +$225K |
| **Total Year 1 Cost** | - | - | **+$339K** |

**Does the amendment provide adequate cushion?**

| Quarter | Original Covenant | New Covenant | Pro Forma Leverage | Cushion |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------| --------|
| Q1 2026 | 4.50x | 5.25x | 4.42x | 0.83x (Yes) |
| Q2 2026 | 4.50x | 5.25x | 4.59x | 0.66x (Yes) |
| Q3 2026 | 4.50x | 4.75x | 4.42x | 0.33x (Yes) |
| Q4 2026 | 4.50x | 4.75x | 4.19x | 0.56x (Yes) |

**Conclusion:** The amendment provides adequate cushion for the **leverage covenant** under Base Case. However:

1. **Interest Coverage** remains at risk (2.50x min vs. projected 2.30-2.49x)
2. **FCCR** remains breached (1.00x min vs. projected 0.92-1.02x) even with relaxed threshold

**Recommendation:** Accept the amendment terms but request:
- FCCR holiday through Q2 2026 (testing resumed Q3 at 1.00x)
- Interest coverage reduced to 2.25x through Q2 2026
- Or, increase equity cure to $4M to create additional cushion

### Lender Communication Memo

**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** First Mountain Bank, Regional Credit Partners
**FROM:** [CFO], Alpine Logistics Holdings
**DATE:** January 15, 2026
**RE:** Covenant Compliance Update and Amendment Request

---

**PURPOSE**

This memo provides an update on Alpine Logistics' financial performance, covenant compliance status, and our request for a limited covenant amendment to address near-term market headwinds.

**CURRENT STATUS**

As of Q4 2025, Alpine Logistics is in compliance with all financial covenants:

| Covenant | Actual | Requirement | Status |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Leverage | 3.93x | 5.00x max | Compliant |
| Interest Coverage | 2.87x | 2.25x min | Compliant |
| FCCR | 1.19x | 1.05x min | Compliant |

**MARKET CONTEXT**

The freight transportation market experienced significant softening in H2 2025, with spot rates declining 18% and contract rates declining 8%. These conditions are expected to persist through H1 2026 before recovering.

Alpine's Q4 2025 EBITDA of $2.0M (vs. $3.3M in Q2 2025) reflects this market pressure. Our 2026 Base Case projects gradual recovery to $2.5M quarterly EBITDA by year-end.

**COVENANT OUTLOOK**

Under current covenant thresholds, we project technical breaches beginning Q1 2026:

| Covenant | Q1 2026 Proj. | Requirement | Shortfall |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Leverage | 4.55x | 4.50x | (0.05x) |
| Interest Coverage | 2.45x | 2.50x | (0.05x) |
| FCCR | 1.02x | 1.10x | (0.08x) |

**AMENDMENT REQUEST**

We respectfully request a limited covenant amendment providing:

1. **Leverage relief**: 5.25x through Q2 2026, stepping to 4.75x for Q3-Q4 2026
2. **Interest coverage relief**: 2.25x through Q2 2026
3. **FCCR relief**: 1.00x through 2026
4. **Equity cure provision**: Mountain View Capital has committed to a $2M equity injection within 30 days

**SPONSOR SUPPORT**

Mountain View Capital remains fully committed to Alpine and has authorized:
- $2M equity injection (deployable within 30 days)
- Additional $2M standby commitment if conditions worsen
- Continued board engagement and operational support

**FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS OFFERED**

In exchange for covenant relief, we propose:
- Amendment fee of 50 bps ($225,000)
- Interest rate increase of 25 bps
- Enhanced monthly financial reporting
- Quarterly in-person lender meetings

**CONCLUSION**

Alpine's core business remains sound. The covenant pressure reflects temporary market conditions, not structural issues. With sponsor support and temporary covenant relief, we are confident in navigating this period and returning to robust covenant cushion by 2027.

We welcome the opportunity to discuss this request at your earliest convenience.

### Key Learning Points

1. **TTM calculations matter**: Covenant ratios use trailing twelve-month figures. Understand how weak quarters "roll off" and affect future compliance.

2. **FCCR is often the binding constraint**: Unlike leverage and interest coverage which only depend on EBITDA and debt, FCCR also captures CapEx and taxes. Capital-intensive businesses often trip FCCR first.

3. **Proactive communication is essential**: Approach lenders before a breach, not after. Lenders prefer borrowers who anticipate problems and propose solutions.

4. **Sponsor support is critical**: In stress situations, the sponsor's willingness to inject equity often determines whether amendments are achievable.

5. **Amendment costs add up**: Between fees (50-100 bps), rate increases (25-50 bps), and professional fees ($50-100K), amendments can cost $300-500K. Factor this into the decision.

6. **Operational levers exist**: Before seeking amendments, exhaust operational options: defer CapEx, reduce costs, manage working capital. Lenders will ask what management is doing before asking what they should concede.

## Extension Activities

1. **Stress Test Model**: Build a covenant compliance model in Excel that allows you to flex EBITDA, CapEx, and debt balances to see real-time covenant impact.

2. **Amendment Term Sheet**: Draft a formal amendment request letter to the lending group.

3. **Board Presentation**: Create a 5-slide presentation for the PE sponsor board summarizing the covenant situation and recommended path forward.

4. **Intercreditor Dynamics**: If there were both senior and subordinated lenders, how would the amendment negotiation differ?
