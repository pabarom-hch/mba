## Part 1: Strategy & Thesis Development

### Background

You and your partners have the following backgrounds:

**Marcus Chen (You)**
- 12 years PE at Vista Equity and Catalyst Partners
- Led 8 IT services deals with 2.4x average MOIC
- Deep operational playbook for IT services

**Sarah Rodriguez**
- 10 years in government contracting (Booz Allen, SAIC)
- VP of Strategy at $200M government IT firm
- Extensive federal/state procurement relationships

**David Park**
- 7 years PE at Audax Private Equity
- CPA with transaction advisory background
- Due diligence and portfolio operations expertise

### Exercise 1.1: Investment Thesis Development

Complete the investment thesis framework for SAF Partners:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| **What do we invest in?** | |
| **Why will this market generate strong returns?** | |
| **How will we create value?** | |
| **Who is our team and why are we differentiated?** | |
| **What returns do we target?** | |

<details>
<summary>Show Recommended Thesis</summary>

| Question | SAF Partners Answer |
|----------|-------------------|
| **What?** | Government IT services companies ($5-30M revenue) with federal, state, or local contracts |
| **Why?** | $150B+ federal IT spend growing 5-7% annually; 10,000+ small contractors; aging founders (avg. 58) creating succession deals |
| **How?** | Buy platforms at 0.75-1.0x revenue, improve operations to 15%+ EBITDA margins, execute 3-4 add-ons per platform, transform to managed services |
| **Who?** | Sarah's government relationships = proprietary deal flow; Marcus's IT services playbook = operational improvement; Combined network of 200+ government IT executives |
| **Returns?** | 3.0x gross MOIC, 25%+ net IRR, 4-6 year holds |

**Key Insight**: A strong thesis is specific (government IT, not "IT services"), differentiated (Sarah's relationships), and repeatable (10,000+ targets).

</details>

### Exercise 1.2: Fund Sizing

Calculate the optimal fund size for SAF Partners:

**Your assumptions:**
- Target 8-10 platform investments
- Average equity check: $5-8M per platform
- Average 3 add-ons per platform at $1.5M each
- Follow-on reserve: 10% of fund
- Fee/expense reserve: 5% of fund

**Calculate:**

| Component | Your Calculation |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Platform capital (platforms × avg check) | $ |
| Add-on reserve | $ |
| Follow-on reserve | $ |
| Fee/expense reserve | $ |
| **Total Fund Size** | $ |

<details>
<summary>Show Calculation</summary>

| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Platform capital | 8 platforms × $6.5M avg | $52M |
| Add-on reserve | 8 platforms × 3 add-ons × $1.5M | $36M |
| Follow-on reserve | 10% × ($52M + $36M) | $8.8M → $8M |
| Fee/expense reserve | 5% × total | ~$4M |
| **Total Fund Size** | | **$100M** |

**Reality check**: $100M may be aggressive for Fund I. SAF targets **$75M** with $90M hard cap — more achievable while still supporting the strategy.

**GP Economics Test**:
- $75M × 2.0% = $1.5M annual management fee
- Operating costs: ~$1.15M
- Net fee income: $350K — viable but tight

</details>

### Exercise 1.3: Thesis Validation Scorecard

Score your thesis on each dimension (1-5 scale):

| Criterion | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Specific** (clear target market) | /5 | |
| **Differentiated** (why this team) | /5 | |
| **Repeatable** (enough deals) | /5 | |
| **Scalable** (can grow for Fund II) | /5 | |
| **Defensible** (competitive moat) | /5 | |
| **Validated** (LP feedback positive) | /5 | |
| **Average** | /5 | |

<details>
<summary>Show Recommended Scores</summary>

| Criterion | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Specific** | 5 | Government IT services, $5-30M revenue, federal/state/local |
| **Differentiated** | 5 | Only dedicated gov't IT fund at $75M size; Sarah's relationships |
| **Repeatable** | 4 | 10,000+ targets; some execution risk in fragmented market |
| **Scalable** | 4 | $150B market; Fund II could be 2x |
| **Defensible** | 4 | Relationships + clearances create barriers |
| **Validated** | 3 | Need LP feedback to confirm |
| **Average** | **4.2** | **Strong thesis — proceed to formation** |

**Interpretation**:
- 4.5-5.0: Exceptional
- 4.0-4.4: Strong — proceed with confidence
- 3.5-3.9: Viable — address gaps
- <3.5: Rethink strategy

</details>

## Part 2: Fund Structuring & Legal

### Exercise 2.1: Structure Selection

For each decision, select the appropriate choice for SAF Partners and explain your rationale:

**Decision 1: Fund Vehicle**
- [ ] Delaware Limited Partnership
- [ ] Delaware LLC
- [ ] Cayman Islands LP
- [ ] Master-Feeder Structure

**Decision 2: Investment Company Exemption**
- [ ] 3(c)(1) — up to 100 accredited investors
- [ ] 3(c)(7) — unlimited qualified purchasers

**Decision 3: SEC Registration**
- [ ] Full SEC Registration
- [ ] Exempt Reporting Adviser (ERA)
- [ ] No registration required

<details>
<summary>Show Recommended Structure</summary>

**Decision 1: Delaware Limited Partnership** ✓
- Industry standard for PE funds
- Clear GP/LP roles and liability protection
- Well-developed legal precedent
- Pass-through tax treatment

**Decision 2: 3(c)(7)** ✓
- Want flexibility for 25+ LPs
- All institutional LPs are qualified purchasers anyway
- Removes 100-investor cap

**Decision 3: Exempt Reporting Adviser** ✓
- Fund <$150M AUM
- File abbreviated Form ADV
- Avoid full registration burden
- Upgrade to full registration if Fund II exceeds $150M

</details>

### Exercise 2.2: LPA Terms Design

Complete the term sheet for SAF Partners Fund I:

| Term | Your Recommendation | Rationale |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Management Fee (Inv. Period)** | % | |
| **Management Fee (Post-Inv.)** | % on | |
| **Carried Interest** | % | |
| **Preferred Return** | % | |
| **Waterfall** | European / American | |
| **Catch-Up** | % | |
| **GP Commitment** | % | |
| **Clawback** | | |

<details>
<summary>Show Recommended Terms</summary>

| Term | SAF Fund I | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Management Fee (Inv. Period)** | 2.0% on committed | Standard for Fund I |
| **Management Fee (Post-Inv.)** | 1.5% on invested cost | Standard step-down |
| **Carried Interest** | 20% | Industry standard |
| **Preferred Return** | 8% compounded | Market rate |
| **Waterfall** | European (whole-fund) | LP-preferred; builds trust |
| **Catch-Up** | 100% to GP | Standard |
| **GP Commitment** | 2.5% ($1.875M) | Above 2% minimum shows conviction |
| **Clawback** | Full + 30% escrow | Strong LP protection |

**Key Insight**: For Fund I, lean toward LP-friendly terms. The reputational benefit of European waterfall and strong clawback provisions outweighs the GP economic benefit of American waterfall.

</details>

### Exercise 2.3: Waterfall Calculation

**Scenario**: SAF Partners Fund I ($75M) achieves 2.5x gross MOIC over 5 years.

Calculate the distribution waterfall:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Capital called | $72M |
| Total realizations | $180M |
| Fund life | 5.5 years avg |

**Step 1: Return of Capital**
- LP capital returned: $______

**Step 2: Preferred Return (8% compounded)**
- Preferred amount: $72M × (1.08^5.5 - 1) = $______

**Step 3: GP Catch-Up (100%)**
- Total profits: $______
- GP target (20%): $______

**Step 4: 80/20 Split**
- Remaining: $______
- LPs receive (80%): $______
- GP receives (20%): $______

**Final Totals:**

| | LP | GP (Carry) |
|--|-----|-----------|
| Total | $ | $ |
| LP Net MOIC | | |

<details>
<summary>Show Calculation</summary>

**Step 1: Return of Capital**
- LP capital returned: **$72M**
- Remaining: $180M - $72M = $108M

**Step 2: Preferred Return**
- $72M × (1.08^5.5 - 1) = $72M × 0.519 = **$37.4M**
- Remaining: $108M - $37.4M = $70.6M

**Step 3: GP Catch-Up**
- Total profits: $108M
- GP target: 20% × $108M = **$21.6M**
- GP receives 100% until caught up: $21.6M
- Remaining: $70.6M - $21.6M = $49.0M

**Step 4: 80/20 Split**
- LPs receive: $49.0M × 80% = **$39.2M**
- GP receives: $49.0M × 20% = **$9.8M**

**Final Totals:**

| | LP | GP (Carry) |
|--|-----|-----------|
| Step 1 | $72.0M | $0 |
| Step 2 | $37.4M | $0 |
| Step 3 | $0 | $21.6M |
| Step 4 | $39.2M | $9.8M |
| **Total** | **$148.6M** | **$31.4M** |
| LP Net MOIC | **2.06x** | |

## Part 3: Fundraising Campaign

### Exercise 3.1: LP Targeting Strategy

Design your LP targeting approach for a $75M Fund I:

| LP Type | Target Count | Avg. Commitment | Target Capital | Priority (H/M/L) |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Emerging Manager FoFs | | $ | $ | |
| Traditional FoFs | | $ | $ | |
| Family Offices | | $ | $ | |
| HNW Individuals | | $ | $ | |
| GP Commitment | | $ | $ | |
| **Total** | | | **$75M** | |

<details>
<summary>Show Recommended Strategy</summary>

| LP Type | Target | Avg. Commit | Target Cap | Priority |
|---------|--------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Anchor (EM FoF) | 1 | $15M | $15M | Highest |
| FoFs | 3-4 | $5M | $15-20M | High |
| Family Offices | 6-8 | $4M | $25-30M | High |
| HNW | 10-12 | $1M | $10-12M | Medium |
| GP Commitment | — | $1.875M | $1.875M | Required |
| **Total** | **22-26** | | **$75M** | |

**Key Insight**: Start with anchor LP — their commitment validates the fund and attracts others. Family offices with government/IT backgrounds are strong fits.

</details>

### Exercise 3.2: Handling LP Objections

For each common objection, write your response:

**Objection 1**: "We don't invest in first-time funds."

Your response:
_______________

<details>
<summary>Show Recommended Response</summary>

"We understand your policy. While this is SAF's first fund, it's not our first time managing capital. Marcus has led 8 realized deals at Vista Equity with 2.4x average MOIC — that's a top-quartile track record. Sarah built and integrated 3 acquisitions as corporate development leader. We're happy to provide detailed deal-by-deal attribution and references from prior LPs and portfolio company CEOs."

</details>

**Objection 2**: "Your fund is too small for us — we need to write $25M+ checks."

Your response:
_______________

<details>
<summary>Show Recommended Response</summary>

"We appreciate the feedback. At $75M, we're sized appropriately for our strategy — government IT services at $5-30M revenue. For Fund II, we expect to scale to $150-175M based on the pipeline we're building. We'd welcome the opportunity to build the relationship now through a smaller commitment or advisory role, positioning you for a larger allocation in Fund II."

</details>

**Objection 3**: "Government IT services seems very niche. How do you know there are enough deals?"

Your response:
_______________

<details>
<summary>Show Recommended Response</summary>

"Great question — let me share the data. Federal IT spending alone is $150B+ annually, growing 5-7%. There are over 10,000 small government contractors, and the average founder age is 58 — creating a wave of succession-driven deal flow. In our first 6 months of sourcing, we've identified 45 companies that fit our criteria. HCH Enterprises, our first deal, came from Sarah's network — demonstrating the proprietary deal flow our relationships generate."

</details>

### Exercise 3.3: Fundraising Funnel Analysis

You've completed 8 weeks of fundraising with the following results:

| Stage | Count | Potential $M |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Universe identified | 180 | — |
| Qualified (fit criteria) | 90 | $450M |
| Contacted | 65 | $325M |
| First meeting completed | 22 | $110M |
| In diligence | 8 | $55M |
| Verbal commitment | 4 | $28M |

**Questions:**

a) What is your contact-to-meeting conversion rate?
b) What is your meeting-to-diligence conversion rate?
c) At current conversion rates, how much capital can you expect to close?
d) What actions would you take to improve the funnel?

<details>
<summary>Show Analysis</summary>

**a) Contact-to-meeting**: 22/65 = **34%** (good)

**b) Meeting-to-diligence**: 8/22 = **36%** (average)

**c) Expected close** (assuming 70% close rate on diligence):
- Current in DD: 8 × 70% = 5.6 LPs
- Verbal: 4 × 90% = 3.6 LPs
- Total: ~9 LPs, ~$60M (below $75M target)

**d) Actions to improve:**
1. Re-engage the 14 LPs who had meetings but didn't advance — understand objections
2. Accelerate outreach to remaining 25 qualified LPs not yet contacted
3. Ask committed LPs for introductions to their networks
4. Consider offering co-investment rights to increase average commitment
5. Evaluate anchor LP terms to accelerate their commitment

</details>

## Part 4: First Close & HCH Acquisition

### Exercise 4.1: First Close Decision

It's July 2026. You have the following commitments:

| LP | Commitment | Status |
|----|-----------|--------|
| Emerging Manager Capital | $15M | Signed |
| Meridian Partners | $5M | Signed |
| Clearwater Capital | $3M | Signed |
| Chen Family Office | $4M | Signed |
| Williams Trust | $3M | Signed |
| Rodriguez Family | $2M | Signed |
| Park Investments | $1.5M | Signed |
| GP Commitment | $1.5M | Signed |
| **Total** | **$35M** | |

Your LPA requires minimum first close of $25M (33% of $75M target).

**Decision**: Should you proceed with first close?

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Meets minimum threshold? | Yes/No |
| % of target achieved | % |
| LP mix appropriate? | |
| Pipeline for subsequent close? | |
| Deal ready? (HCH under LOI) | |

**Your recommendation:**
_______________

<details>
<summary>Show Recommended Decision</summary>

**Proceed with First Close** ✓

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Meets minimum threshold? | **Yes** ($35M > $25M minimum) |
| % of target achieved | **47%** (strong for Fund I) |
| LP mix appropriate? | **Good** — anchor + FoFs + family offices |
| Pipeline for subsequent close? | **Yes** — $25M+ in active DD |
| Deal ready? | **Yes** — HCH under LOI |

**Rationale**: First close at 47% is a strong signal. Having a deal ready (HCH) demonstrates deployment capability. Anchor LP commitment provides validation. Waiting risks losing momentum and LP interest.

</details>

### Exercise 4.2: Capital Call Calculation

You're issuing your first capital call for the HCH acquisition:

**Uses:**
- HCH purchase price: $4.72M
- Working capital: $0.78M
- Transaction costs: $0.60M
- Escrow: $0.40M (investor protection)
- Q4 management fee: $0.35M
- Organizational expenses: $0.15M

**Total call needed**: $______

Calculate each LP's pro-rata share:

| LP | Commitment | % | Call Amount |
|----|-----------|---|-------------|
| Emerging Manager Capital | $15.0M | | $ |
| Meridian Partners | $5.0M | | $ |
| Clearwater Capital | $3.0M | | $ |
| Chen Family Office | $4.0M | | $ |
| Williams Trust | $3.0M | | $ |
| Rodriguez Family | $2.0M | | $ |
| Park Investments | $1.5M | | $ |
| GP Commitment | $1.5M | | $ |
| **Total** | **$35.0M** | **100%** | $ |

<details>
<summary>Show Calculation</summary>

**Total call needed**: $7.00M

| LP | Commitment | % | Call Amount |
|----|-----------|---|-------------|
| Emerging Manager Capital | $15.0M | 42.86% | $3,000,000 |
| Meridian Partners | $5.0M | 14.29% | $1,000,000 |
| Clearwater Capital | $3.0M | 8.57% | $600,000 |
| Chen Family Office | $4.0M | 11.43% | $800,000 |
| Williams Trust | $3.0M | 8.57% | $600,000 |
| Rodriguez Family | $2.0M | 5.71% | $400,000 |
| Park Investments | $1.5M | 4.29% | $300,000 |
| GP Commitment | $1.5M | 4.29% | $300,000 |
| **Total** | **$35.0M** | **100%** | **$7,000,000** |

</details>

### Exercise 4.3: HCH Acquisition Structure

Design the acquisition structure for HCH Enterprises:

**HCH Profile:**
- Revenue: $6.29M
- EBITDA: ($415K) — operating at a loss
- Enterprise Value: $4.72M (0.75x revenue)
- Existing debt: $1.16M

**Questions:**

a) What ownership structure would you recommend (GP/management split)?

b) Should you assume the existing debt or refinance?

c) What management incentives would you include?

<details>
<summary>Show Recommended Structure</summary>

**a) Ownership Structure:**
- SAF Partners Fund I: **85%**
- Management rollover: **10%** (demonstrates alignment)
- Option pool: **5%** (for key hires)

**b) Debt Decision:**
- **Assume existing debt** ($1.16M)
- Rationale: Small amount; refinancing costs not justified
- Plan: Pay down with operational cash flow improvements

**c) Management Incentives:**
- **Rollover equity**: Require CEO to roll 50%+ of proceeds
- **Option grants**: Key employees get options in 5% pool
- **Earnout**: Additional 5% if EBITDA targets hit in Year 2
- **Stay bonuses**: 6-month retention bonuses for critical staff

</details>

## Part 5: Fund Economics & Projections

### Exercise 5.1: GP Economics Model

Model the GP economics over the 10-year fund life:

**Assumptions:**
- Fund size: $75M
- Management fee: 2.0% (Years 1-4); 1.5% on invested (Years 5-10)
- Deployment: 85% of fund invested
- Operating costs: $1.15M/year
- Target gross MOIC: 2.5x
- Carry: 20%

**Calculate:**

| Metric | Your Calculation |
|--------|-----------------|
| Total management fees (10 years) | $ |
| Total operating costs (10 years) | $ |
| Net fee income | $ |
| Estimated carry (at 2.5x gross) | $ |
| Total GP economics | $ |

<details>
<summary>Show Calculation</summary>

**Management Fees:**
- Years 1-4: $75M × 2.0% × 4 = **$6.0M**
- Years 5-10: $63.75M × 1.5% × 6 = **$5.74M**
- Total: **$11.74M**

**Operating Costs:**
- $1.15M × 10 years = **$11.5M**

**Net Fee Income:**
- $11.74M - $11.5M = **$0.24M** (breakeven on fees)

**Carry Estimate:**
- Capital deployed: $63.75M
- Gross value at 2.5x: $159.4M
- Profits: $159.4M - $63.75M = $95.6M
- After preferred: ~$30M to GP (20% of $95.6M, adjusted for waterfall)
- Estimated carry: **~$25-30M**

**Total GP Economics:**
- Net fees: $0.24M
- Carry: $27.5M (midpoint)
- **Total: ~$28M over fund life**

**Key Insight**: PE fund economics are carry-driven. Management fees cover operations; carry creates wealth.

</details>

### Exercise 5.2: Fund II Planning

Based on Fund I trajectory, plan for Fund II:

**Fund I Status (End of Year 3):**
- 75% deployed
- 2 realized exits (1.8x and 2.2x MOIC)
- Net IRR: 22%
- DPI: 0.25x

**Questions:**

a) When should SAF begin Fund II marketing?

b) What fund size would you target for Fund II?

c) What LP re-up rate should you assume?

<details>
<summary>Show Recommended Plan</summary>

**a) Fund II Timing:**
Begin marketing in **Month 6 of Year 4** (when Fund I is ~85% deployed)

Rationale:
- 60-75% deployment is optimal window
- Have 2 realized exits to demonstrate performance
- 22% net IRR is top-quartile
- Need 12-15 months to raise Fund II

**b) Fund II Size:**
Target: **$140-150M** (1.9-2.0x step-up)

Calculation:
- Re-ups: $73M × 85% × 1.3 increase = $80M
- New LPs: 8-10 × $6M avg = $55M
- GP: 3% × $145M = $4.4M
- Total: ~$140M

**c) Re-Up Rate:**
Assume **80-85%** based on:
- Top-quartile performance
- Strong LP relationships
- Transparent communication

</details>

## Simulation Debrief

### Reflection Questions

1. **Thesis Development**: What made SAF's thesis compelling? How would you improve it?

2. **Fund Sizing**: Why did SAF choose $75M instead of $100M? What are the trade-offs?

3. **LP Strategy**: Why focus on FoFs and family offices vs. large pensions?

4. **Terms Negotiation**: When would you consider deviating from standard 2/20 terms?

5. **First Investment**: Why was HCH a good first platform despite operating losses?

### Key Takeaways

| Lesson | Key Insight |
|--------|-------------|
| **Strategy** | Differentiation comes from team edge, not just sector focus |
| **Sizing** | Fund size must balance strategy needs with fundraising reality |
| **Terms** | LP-friendly terms build trust; returns are in the carry, not fees |
| **Fundraising** | Anchor LPs de-risk the raise for others |
| **Execution** | Having a deal ready at first close demonstrates capabilities |
| **GP Economics** | Management fees cover costs; carry creates wealth |
