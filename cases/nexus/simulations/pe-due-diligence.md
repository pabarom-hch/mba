### Exhibit 4: Additional Due Diligence Information

**From Financial Statement Analysis:**

1. **Revenue Recognition**: Management records revenue at shipment. There is approximately $380,000 in unbilled revenue for goods shipped but not yet invoiced in the LTM period.

2. **Inventory Valuation**: The company uses FIFO. Raw material prices increased 8% year-over-year. Finished goods inventory has grown faster than revenue (inventory days: 65 in FY2023, 78 in FY2025).

3. **Accounts Receivable**: DSO has increased from 42 days to 58 days over three years. Management reports one customer dispute ($215,000) they believe will resolve favorably.

4. **Rent Expense**: The company moved to a new, larger facility in FY2025. New lease is $95,000/month ($1,140,000/year) vs. old lease of $65,000/month. Management classified $285K of move costs as non-recurring.

5. **Professional Fees**: FY2025 includes $425K in legal fees for patent litigation (settled) and $260K in investment banking/transaction fees.

**From Management Interviews:**

6. **Owner Compensation**: Bob Thompson takes $925,000 in salary plus an additional $185,000 in personal expenses. He also has his wife on payroll at $120,000/year as "Administrative Assistant" though she works approximately 10 hours per month.

7. **Key Employee Departure**: The VP of Sales (15 years tenure, responsible for 40% of customer relationships) announced resignation effective 60 days post-close. Management has not disclosed this to buyers.

8. **Equipment Status**: The CNC machine failure was due to deferred maintenance. Three additional machines (representing 25% of capacity) are past their useful life and will require replacement within 18 months at an estimated cost of $2.2M.

9. **Customer Contracts**: Top customer (28% of revenue) contract expires in 8 months. Renewal discussions have not begun. Customer has been soliciting bids from competitors.

**From Site Visit Observations:**

10. **Workforce**: Observed significant use of temporary workers (18% of workforce). Turnover in hourly positions is 45% annually. Union organizing campaign underway.

11. **IT Systems**: ERP system is 15 years old and requires manual workarounds. Data integrity issues noted in inventory tracking.

12. **Environmental**: One underground storage tank was removed 5 years ago. Phase I environmental showed "recognized environmental condition" requiring Phase II assessment.

### Task 1: Evaluation of Management's Adjustments

| Add-Back | Claimed | Decision | Accepted | Rationale |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Owner comp above market | $525,000 | **H** | $400,000 | Market CEO salary is $350-450K, not $400K. Accept $525K excess, but deduct wife's inflated salary ($120K vs. $25K market = $95K reduction). Net: $525K - $95K - $30K buffer = $400K |
| Personal expenses | $185,000 | **A** | $185,000 | Clearly personal; well-documented. Full add-back appropriate |
| Legal fees (patent) | $425,000 | **H** | $300,000 | Patent dispute was one-time, but company has history of IP issues. Reserve $125K for ongoing legal baseline. Accept $300K |
| Facility move costs | $285,000 | **H** | $200,000 | Moving costs are one-time, but some costs were accelerated maintenance that would have occurred anyway. Accept $200K of truly one-time costs |
| Recruiting costs | $165,000 | **R** | $50,000 | VP Ops and CFO hires are standard for a company this size. Only truly incremental search fees ($50K) should add back; rest is normal operating cost |
| COVID costs | $125,000 | **R** | $0 | We are in 2025; COVID costs are now baseline operating costs. Not a valid add-back |
| Equipment failure | $320,000 | **R** | $0 | Equipment failed due to deferred maintenance, not truly one-time event. More machines are at risk. This is a recurring issue |
| Inventory write-off | $175,000 | **H** | $100,000 | Some write-off is one-time cleanup, but with increasing inventory days, ongoing obsolescence is a concern. Accept $100K |
| Customer concentration | $125,000 | **R** | $0 | Lost and replaced customers is normal business cycle. Revenue risk is a business risk, not an adjustment |
| **TOTAL** | **$2,330,000** | | **$1,235,000** | Management add-backs reduced by 47% |

### Task 2: Additional Adjustments

| Item | Type | Amount | Rationale |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| Wife's salary above market | Add-back | +$95,000 | She works 10 hrs/month; market rate ~$25K for that role. Excess $95K is owner benefit |
| Transaction-related fees | Add-back | +$260,000 | Investment banking and deal fees in FY2025 professional fees are clearly non-recurring |
| Higher rent expense (normalized) | Deduction | -$95,000 | New facility costs $1.14M/year; old was $780K. One-time move costs excluded, but need to normalize for run-rate rent increase |
| VP Sales replacement cost | Deduction | -$150,000 | Will need to recruit replacement (search fees ~$75K) and transition period salary overlap (~$75K). Not disclosed by management |
| Equipment CapEx requirement | Note only | N/A | $2.2M in equipment replacement needed. Not EBITDA adjustment but affects cash flow/returns |
| Unbilled revenue | Deduction | -$125,000 | Aggressive revenue recognition. Estimate 1/3 may not convert to actual collections |

**Additional Add-backs**: +$355,000
**Additional Deductions**: -$370,000
**Net Additional Adjustments**: -$15,000

### Task 3: Normalized EBITDA Calculation

| Item | Amount |

| Legal fees (adjusted) | $300,000 |
| Facility move costs (adjusted) | $200,000 |
| Recruiting costs (adjusted) | $50,000 |
| Inventory write-off (adjusted) | $100,000 |
| *Subtotal Validated Add-backs* | $1,235,000 |

| VP Sales replacement | ($150,000) |
| Revenue recognition adjustment | ($125,000) |
| *Subtotal Deductions* | ($370,000) |
| | |
| **YOUR NORMALIZED EBITDA** | **$5,810,000** |
| **Management's Claimed EBITDA** | $6,920,000 |
| **Variance** | **($1,110,000)** |
| **Variance %** | **-16.0%** |

### Implied Valuation Impact

| Metric | Management View | Your View |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Adjusted EBITDA | $6,920,000 | $5,810,000 |
| Entry Multiple | 6.5x | 6.5x |
| Implied EV | $45,000,000 | $37,765,000 |
| Price Reduction Needed | - | $7,235,000 |

**Or, at $45M purchase price:**
- Management's Multiple: 6.5x
- Your Multiple: 7.75x (above market for this quality)

### Task 4: Red Flags

| Red Flag | Category | Severity | Mitigation |
|----------|----------|----------|------------|
| VP Sales departing post-close | Management/Key Person | **HIGH** | Require retention agreement or escrow holdback. Customer intro meetings pre-close |
| Top customer (28%) contract expiring in 8 months | Revenue Quality | **HIGH** | Require customer reference call. Contract renewal contingency or earnout tied to retention |
| Equipment requiring $2.2M replacement | CapEx/Cash Flow | **HIGH** | Reduce purchase price by $1.5M (50% of estimated cost) or require seller indemnity |
| Deferred maintenance culture | Operations | **MEDIUM** | Detailed equipment condition assessment. Build maintenance budget into model |
| Environmental concern (UST) | Legal/Environmental | **MEDIUM** | Complete Phase II before close. Require environmental indemnity from seller |
| Union organizing campaign | Labor | **MEDIUM** | Labor counsel assessment. Model potential wage increase |
| Increasing DSO (42 to 58 days) | Working Capital | **MEDIUM** | Age AR detailed review. Reserve for bad debt exposure |
| Inventory build-up (65 to 78 days) | Working Capital | **MEDIUM** | Detailed inventory walk. Identify additional obsolescence exposure |
| IT system obsolescence | Operations | **LOW** | Budget $250-350K for ERP replacement in Year 1 |
| Temporary worker reliance (18%) | Labor | **LOW** | Assess conversion costs and timeline |

### Task 5: Investment Recommendation

**Recommendation**: **Proceed with price reduction to $38.0 million (6.5x your normalized EBITDA) plus additional protections**

**Key Rationale:**

1. **EBITDA Variance is Material**: Management's adjusted EBITDA of $6.92M overstates true earnings by $1.1M (16%). This alone justifies a $7M+ price reduction at the proposed multiple.

2. **Hidden Deal Risks**: The undisclosed VP Sales departure and at-risk top customer relationship represent $12M+ in revenue at risk within 12 months. These were not communicated during LOI negotiation.

3. **CapEx Requirements Underestimated**: The $2.2M equipment replacement need affects Year 1-2 free cash flow and should either reduce price or be funded from a seller escrow.

4. **Deal Can Still Work**: At $38M (6.5x $5.81M), the deal represents fair value for a company with these risk factors. The underlying business has solid gross margins (32%) and diversified end markets.

5. **Recommended Protections:**
   - $4M escrow (10.5% of EV) for 18 months covering: equipment CapEx, customer concentration, environmental
   - Seller indemnity for VP Sales transition (capped at $500K)
   - Earnout: $2M tied to top customer renewal within 12 months
   - Environmental indemnity (uncapped for UST-related claims)
   - Extended R&W insurance coverage

**Alternative**: If seller refuses $38M price, walk away. The risks at $45M create unacceptable downside with inadequate margin of safety.

### Summary EBITDA Bridge

```
Management Claimed EBITDA:        $6,920,000
Less: Rejected/Haircut Add-backs: ($1,095,000)
Plus: Additional Valid Add-backs:   $355,000
Less: Required Deductions:         ($370,000)
                                  ──────────
YOUR NORMALIZED EBITDA:           $5,810,000
```

### Key Learning Points

1. **Always scrub management add-backs**: Management's adjustments are inherently biased toward maximizing EBITDA. In this case, they overstated by 16%.

2. **Look for what's NOT disclosed**: The VP Sales departure and customer contract status were hidden. Always ask specific questions about key person retention and customer contract status.

3. **Distinguish one-time from recurring**: COVID costs in 2025 are no longer one-time. Equipment failures from deferred maintenance are systemic, not one-time.

4. **Consider the full cash picture**: EBITDA adjustments don't capture CapEx needs. The $2.2M equipment requirement significantly impacts returns.

5. **Red flags inform deal structure, not just price**: Sometimes the right answer is more protections rather than (or in addition to) price reduction.

## Extension Activities

1. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Model returns at your normalized EBITDA ($5.81M) vs. management's ($6.92M) at 5-year exit. How does IRR differ?

2. **Counter-Proposal Memo**: Draft the talking points for renegotiating with the seller at your $38M valuation.

3. **100-Day Plan**: Assuming the deal closes at your terms, what are the top 5 priorities for the first 100 days?
