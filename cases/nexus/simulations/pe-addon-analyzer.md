# Add-On Acquisition Analyzer Simulation

## Buy-and-Build Strategy: Precision Medical Components Group

**Estimated Time**: 60-90 minutes
**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced
**Prerequisites**: M&A Fundamentals, Financial Modeling, PE Investment Analysis

---

## Overview

You are a Principal at Apex Healthcare Partners, a healthcare-focused private equity firm. Two years ago, your firm acquired Precision Medical Components Group (PMCG), a contract manufacturer of Class II medical devices, as a platform for a buy-and-build strategy in the medical device supply chain.

The investment thesis called for 3-4 strategic add-on acquisitions over a 5-year hold period. You have identified three potential acquisition targets and must evaluate each for strategic fit, calculate potential synergies, model accretion/dilution, and recommend an acquisition priority for the investment committee.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this simulation, you will be able to:

1. Evaluate strategic fit between a platform company and potential add-on acquisitions
2. Identify and quantify potential synergies (revenue and cost)
3. Model pro forma financials for a combined entity
4. Calculate accretion/dilution to key metrics (EBITDA, margins, multiples)
5. Prioritize multiple acquisition opportunities based on strategic and financial criteria
6. Structure and present an M&A recommendation to an investment committee

### Task 5: Acquisition Priority Recommendation

**Ranking Matrix:**

| Criterion | Weight | A: MedPlast | B: CoatMed | C: Heartland |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Strategic Fit | 25% | 4.2 (1.05) | 3.4 (0.85) | 3.8 (0.95) |
| Synergy Potential | 20% | 3.5 (0.70) | 2.5 (0.50) | 5.0 (1.00) |
| Financial Accretion | 20% | 4.0 (0.80) | 3.0 (0.60) | 4.5 (0.90) |
| Valuation/Price | 15% | 3.5 (0.53) | 2.0 (0.30) | 4.5 (0.68) |
| Integration Risk | 10% | 3.0 (0.30) | 4.0 (0.40) | 4.5 (0.45) |
| Management Quality | 10% | 3.0 (0.30) | 3.0 (0.30) | 5.0 (0.50) |
| **Weighted Score** | 100% | **3.68** | **2.95** | **4.48** |

**Recommendation:**

**Priority 1: Heartland Assembly Services**

*Rationale:*
- **Strongest financial case**: Accretive to margins, paying below-market multiple (8.0x), highest synergy potential ($5.2M annual)
- **Operational fit**: Geographic proximity enables easy integration and manufacturing consolidation
- **Management quality**: Experienced team willing to stay long-term reduces execution risk
- **Scale matters**: $28.4M revenue addition meaningfully advances buy-and-build thesis
- **Risk mitigation**: Customer concentration manageable; customer overlap requires careful transition planning

*Recommended terms*: $34M purchase price with $3M earnout tied to top customer retention (reduces to $31M effective if customer leaves)

**Priority 2: MedPlast Technologies**

*Rationale:*
- **Highest strategic value**: Plastic molding capability is critical gap; West Coast presence needed
- **Clean room assembly** enables PMCG to compete for higher-value finished device work
- **Customer diversification**: Diagnostics exposure reduces orthopedic concentration
- **Reasonable valuation**: 9.0x is market rate; synergies make it attractive

*Risk to manage*: Owner transition plan needs to be robust. Recommend $1.5M retention bonus tied to 18-month transition.

*Recommended sequencing*: Pursue after Heartland integration stabilizes (Month 12-18)

**Priority 3: CoatMed Solutions (Hold)**

*Rationale:*
- **Attractive margins and technology**, but valuation too rich at 12.0x
- **Key person risk** (founder's daughter) creates continuity concern
- **Regulatory uncertainty** on drug-eluting coatings could impair value
- **Small scale** ($9.2M revenue) provides limited strategic impact for price paid

*Recommendation*: Continue monitoring; revisit if valuation falls to 9-10x or if Heartland/MedPlast integrations reveal cross-sell demand for coatings capability

### Investment Committee Memo

---

**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Apex Healthcare Partners Investment Committee
**FROM:** [Your Name], Principal
**DATE:** January 2026
**RE:** PMCG Add-On Acquisition Analysis - Recommendation

---

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

After evaluating three potential add-on acquisitions for Precision Medical Components Group, I recommend the following prioritization:

1. **Priority 1: Heartland Assembly Services** ($34M, 8.0x) - Pursue immediately
2. **Priority 2: MedPlast Technologies** ($26.5M, 9.0x) - Pursue in Month 12-18
3. **Priority 3: CoatMed Solutions** ($27.6M, 12.0x) - Hold/Monitor

**RATIONALE**

**Heartland Assembly Services** represents the best combination of strategic value, financial accretion, and execution certainty:

| Metric | Heartland Impact |
|--------|------------------|
| Revenue added | +$28.4M (55% increase) |
| EBITDA added | +$4.3M + $5.2M synergies |
| Pro forma margin | 25.6% (vs. 21.9% today) |
| Purchase multiple | 8.0x (below 9-10x market) |
| Post-deal leverage | 3.0x (manageable) |
| Management team | Strong, committed |

The combination of geographic proximity (Milwaukee to Minneapolis), assembly/packaging capabilities, and strong management makes this an ideal first acquisition. Synergy potential is highest among the three targets, and the below-market multiple provides valuation cushion.

**MedPlast Technologies** should be second priority. While it offers the highest strategic value (plastics capability, West Coast expansion, diagnostics exposure), the owner transition risk and customer concentration warrant waiting until Heartland integration proves successful.

**CoatMed Solutions** is not recommended at current 12.0x valuation. Despite attractive margins (25%) and differentiated technology, the key person risk and regulatory exposure do not justify a 40% premium to market multiples.

**FINANCIAL IMPACT**

Pro forma assuming both Priority 1 and Priority 2 are executed over 24 months:

| Metric | Current | Post-Heartland | Post-MedPlast |
|--------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Revenue | $52M | $80M | $100M |
| EBITDA | $11.4M | $20.9M | $25.5M |
| Margin | 21.9% | 26.1% | 25.5% |
| Leverage | 2.4x | 3.0x | 3.2x |
| Implied EV (9.5x) | $108M | $199M | $242M |

This positions PMCG for a $250-300M exit at 10x+ multiple within 3 years, consistent with original investment thesis.

**NEXT STEPS**

1. Authorize LOI submission to Heartland at $31M cash + $3M customer retention earnout
2. Schedule management meetings with Heartland for diligence kick-off
3. Continue cultivation of MedPlast relationship for Q4 2026 engagement
4. Pass on CoatMed at current valuation; revisit if circumstances change

---

### Key Learning Points

1. **Not all add-ons are equal**: The "best" target depends on where you are in the buy-and-build journey. Heartland's operational fit makes it ideal as first acquisition despite being less strategically differentiated.

2. **Synergies drive value in buy-and-build**: Heartland's $5.2M synergy potential (12x more than CoatMed despite only 3x the revenue) comes from manufacturing consolidation and geographic proximity.

3. **Price matters**: CoatMed's 12.0x multiple requires ~$3M of additional synergies just to match Heartland's 8.0x on a value-creation basis.

4. **Sequence appropriately**: Execute the high-certainty, operationally-simple deal first. Build integration muscle before tackling transition-risk acquisitions like MedPlast.

5. **Consider the exit story**: Each add-on should enhance the exit narrative. Heartland enables "one-stop shop" positioning. MedPlast adds plastics and West Coast. Together they create a more valuable, diversified platform.

## Extension Activities

1. **Dual-Acquisition Model**: What if you pursue both Heartland and MedPlast simultaneously? Model the combined pro forma and assess integration capacity.

2. **Negotiation Strategy**: Draft the key negotiation points and walk-away triggers for the Heartland LOI.

3. **Integration Playbook**: Create a 100-day integration plan for the Heartland acquisition.

4. **Exit Modeling**: Model the 5-year exit assuming execution of Priorities 1 and 2. What IRR does this generate?
