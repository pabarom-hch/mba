# Nexus Case Studies

> Real business data transformed into MBA learning experiences

---

## Overview

The Nexus case studies bring the MBA curriculum to life by using real (anonymized) data from a professional services firm. Unlike traditional case studies that use external companies, these cases allow you to dive deep into actual business operations.

**Why Nexus?**

| Traditional Cases | Nexus Cases |
|-------------------|-------------|
| External companies | Internal operations |
| Historical snapshots | Current data |
| Limited detail | Full data access |
| Read-only analysis | Interactive simulations |
| Generic lessons | Directly applicable |
