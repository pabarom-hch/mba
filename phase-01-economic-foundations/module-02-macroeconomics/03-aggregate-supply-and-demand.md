- Analyze how shocks affect the economy
- Predict impacts of policy changes on GDP, inflation, and employment
- Apply the model to real-world economic events
- Distinguish short-run and long-run adjustments

## Introduction

The Aggregate Supply/Aggregate Demand (AS/AD) model is the workhorse framework for understanding macroeconomics. It explains how GDP, price levels, and employment are determined and how they respond to shocks and policy interventions.

For CEOs, this model helps predict how economic events—oil price spikes, stimulus programs, trade wars—will affect inflation, growth, and your business environment.

```

### Aggregate Demand (AD)

**Definition:** Total spending in the economy at each price level.

**AD = C + I + G + (X - M)**

**Why AD Slopes Downward:**
1. **Wealth Effect** - Lower prices → higher real wealth → more spending
2. **Interest Rate Effect** - Lower prices → less money needed → lower rates → more investment
3. **Exchange Rate Effect** - Lower prices → currency depreciates → more exports

**AD Shifters (Cause Curve to Move):**

| Factor | Direction | Effect on AD |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Consumer confidence up | Right shift | ↑ |
| Business investment up | Right shift | ↑ |
| Government spending up | Right shift | ↑ |
| Tax cuts | Right shift | ↑ |
| Net exports up | Right shift | ↑ |
| Money supply up | Right shift | ↑ |
| Opposite of above | Left shift | ↓ |

### Aggregate Supply

**Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS):**
- Upward sloping
- Wages and prices partially sticky
- Firms increase output when prices rise

**SRAS Shifters:**

| Factor | Direction | Effect on SRAS |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Input prices down (oil, wages) | Right shift | ↑ |
| Productivity up | Right shift | ↑ |
| Expected inflation down | Right shift | ↑ |
| Supply shock (negative) | Left shift | ↓ |
| Higher wages | Left shift | ↓ |

**Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS):**
- Vertical at potential GDP (Y*)
- Full employment output
- Determined by resources and technology
- Independent of price level

**LRAS Shifters (Long-term Growth):**
- Labor force growth
- Capital accumulation
- Technological progress
- Institutional improvements

### Macroeconomic Equilibrium

**Short-Run Equilibrium:** Where AD intersects SRAS
- Determines current GDP and price level
- Can be above, below, or at potential GDP

**Long-Run Equilibrium:** Where AD intersects SRAS intersects LRAS
- Economy at potential GDP
- No pressure for further adjustment
- Unemployment at natural rate

### Output Gaps

**Recessionary Gap (Negative Output Gap):**
```
P     │         LRAS
      │           │
      │    SRAS   │
      │      ╲    │
      │       ╲   │
      │   E●───╲──│
      │     ╲   ╲ │
      │      ╲   ╲│
      │       AD  │
      │           │
      └───────────────▶ Y
          Y   Y*
        (Gap)
```
- Actual GDP < Potential GDP
- High unemployment
- Downward pressure on prices
- Economy operates below capacity

**Inflationary Gap (Positive Output Gap):**
```
P     │         LRAS
      │           │
      │           │  SRAS
      │           │ ╱
      │           ●E

      │         ╱ │
      │        AD │
      │           │
      └───────────────▶ Y
              Y* Y
             (Gap)
```
- Actual GDP > Potential GDP
- Low unemployment, labor shortage
- Upward pressure on prices
- Economy overheating

## Shock Analysis

### Demand Shocks

**Positive Demand Shock (AD shifts right):**
- Example: Tax cuts, increased government spending, consumer confidence surge
- Effect: Higher GDP, higher prices, lower unemployment
- Short-run: Economy moves to inflationary gap
- Long-run: Wages rise, SRAS shifts left, return to Y* at higher price level

**Negative Demand Shock (AD shifts left):**
- Example: Financial crisis, consumer pessimism, government austerity
- Effect: Lower GDP, lower prices, higher unemployment
- Short-run: Economy moves to recessionary gap
- Long-run: Wages fall, SRAS shifts right, return to Y* at lower price level

### Supply Shocks

**Negative Supply Shock (SRAS shifts left):**
- Example: Oil price spike, natural disaster, pandemic
- Effect: Lower GDP, higher prices (stagflation)
- Policy dilemma: Fighting inflation worsens recession, and vice versa

**Positive Supply Shock (SRAS shifts right):**
- Example: Technological breakthrough, falling commodity prices
- Effect: Higher GDP, lower prices
- Best of both worlds: Growth without inflation

### Real-World Examples

**2008 Financial Crisis (Negative Demand Shock):**
```
Event: Housing bubble bursts, banks fail
→ Consumer wealth destroyed
→ Credit markets freeze
→ Investment collapses
→ AD shifts sharply left
Result: Deep recession, deflation risk
Policy: Massive monetary and fiscal stimulus
```

**1970s Oil Shocks (Negative Supply Shock):**
```
Event: OPEC embargo raises oil prices 4x
→ Production costs spike
→ SRAS shifts left
Result: Stagflation (high inflation + recession)
Policy: Painful choice—Fed ultimately chose to fight inflation
```

**2020 Pandemic:**
```
Event: COVID-19 lockdowns
→ Both supply shock (production stopped) and demand shock (consumers can't spend)
→ AD and SRAS both shift left
Result: Sharp recession, followed by stimulus-driven recovery
→ Later: Supply chains slow to recover + stimulus = inflation
```

## Consulting Application

### Economic Impact Analysis

When advising clients on economic events:

**Step 1: Identify the Shock**
- Is it demand or supply?
- Is it temporary or persistent?
- What's the magnitude?

**Step 2: Trace Through Model**
- Which curve shifts?
- In which direction?
- What happens to equilibrium P and Y?

**Step 3: Assess Policy Response**
- Will policymakers respond?
- How will that change the outcome?
- What's the timing?

**Step 4: Translate to Business Impact**
- How does your client's industry map to this?
- What's the lead/lag relationship?
- What are the specific implications?

### Example Analysis: Tariff Impact

**Client Question:** How will new 25% tariffs on Chinese imports affect our manufacturing business?

**Analysis:**

**Supply Side Impact:**
- Tariffs = higher input costs = SRAS shifts left
- Effect: Lower output, higher prices

**Demand Side Impact:**
- Retaliation likely = exports fall = AD shifts left
- Effect: Lower output, lower prices

**Net Effect:**
- GDP: Definitely lower (both effects reduce output)
- Prices: Ambiguous (supply shock raises, demand shock lowers)
- Most likely: Modest GDP decline, modest inflation

**Client-Specific:**
- Manufacturing with Chinese inputs: Cost pressure
- Exporting to China: Demand decline
- Domestic competitor to Chinese goods: Potential benefit

**Recommendation:** Diversify supply chain, develop alternative markets, model cost scenarios.

## CEO Application

### Policy Anticipation

Understanding AS/AD helps you anticipate policy responses:

**If Economy Weakens (Recessionary Gap):**
- Expect Fed rate cuts
- Possible fiscal stimulus
- Eventually, wages moderate, SRAS adjusts
- Timeline: 12-24 months for full adjustment

**If Economy Overheats (Inflationary Gap):**
- Expect Fed rate hikes
- Possible fiscal tightening
- Eventually, wages rise, SRAS adjusts
- Timeline: 12-24 months for full adjustment

### Strategic Implications by Scenario

| Economic Situation | Policy Response | Business Impact | Your Strategy |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Demand boom | Fed tightens | Rates rise, growth slows | Lock in financing |
| Demand bust | Fed eases, fiscal stimulus | Rates fall, recovery coming | Position for recovery |
| Supply shock (negative) | Difficult choice | Stagflation possible | Manage costs, protect margins |
| Supply shock (positive) | Policy can ease | Growth + low inflation | Invest in growth |

### Reading the Fed

The Fed's job is to close output gaps:
- Recessionary gap → Lower rates (stimulate AD)
- Inflationary gap → Raise rates (reduce AD)

**Understanding Fed Communication:**

| Fed Language | AS/AD Translation | Likely Action |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| "Economy operating below potential" | Recessionary gap | Easing |
| "Labor market tight" | Near or above Y* | Tightening |
| "Inflation expectations rising" | Inflationary gap | Tightening |
| "Supply-side factors" | SRAS shift | Complicated response |

## Worked Example

### Situation

The government announces a $500 billion infrastructure spending package spread over 5 years. Interest rates are currently low. Unemployment is 5% (close to natural rate). Inflation is 2%.

### AS/AD Analysis

**Initial Conditions:**
- Near full employment → Economy at or near Y*
- Low inflation → Price stability
- Low rates → Accommodative monetary policy

**Infrastructure Spending Effect:**

**Step 1: Direct Impact**
- G increases by $100B/year
- AD shifts right

**Step 2: Multiplier Effect**
- Workers and suppliers get paid
- They spend money
- Additional AD shift (multiplier ~1.5x in current conditions)

**Step 3: Equilibrium Movement**
- Economy moves along SRAS to the right
- Higher output, higher prices
- Unemployment falls below natural rate

**Step 4: Long-Run Adjustment**
- Labor market tightens → wages rise
- SRAS shifts left
- Economy returns to Y* at higher price level
- Net effect: More inflation, same real GDP

**BUT: There's a Supply Side Too**
- Infrastructure improves productivity
- LRAS shifts right
- Potential GDP increases
- Can absorb some demand without inflation

**Net Assessment:**
```
Short-run: Higher GDP, modest inflation increase
Long-run: Depends on productivity impact
- If productivity gains are real: Higher Y*, less inflation
- If just spending: Back to Y* at higher prices
```

### Business Implications

| Business Type | Short-Run Impact | Long-Run Impact |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Construction | Major revenue increase | Elevated activity |
| Materials (cement, steel) | Price and volume gains | Higher baseline |
| Equipment makers | Demand surge | Cyclical return |
| Transportation | Benefit from better infrastructure | Lower costs |
| General business | Wage pressure, modest inflation | Depends on productivity gains |

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Confusing Movements vs. Shifts
**Mistake:** Saying "AD shifts when price changes."
**Reality:** Price changes cause movement ALONG curves. Other factors SHIFT curves.

### 2. Ignoring Long-Run Adjustment
**Mistake:** Treating short-run equilibrium as permanent.
**Reality:** Wages and prices adjust over 12-24 months, moving economy toward LRAS.

### 3. Forgetting Policy Response
**Mistake:** Analyzing shocks without considering how policymakers will react.
**Reality:** Central banks and governments respond, changing outcomes.

### 4. One-Side Analysis
**Mistake:** Looking only at demand or only at supply.
**Reality:** Many events affect both curves. Analyze comprehensively.

### 5. Treating the Model as Precise
**Mistake:** Using AS/AD for specific numerical predictions.
**Reality:** It's a framework for directional thinking, not precise forecasting.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **AS/AD determines GDP and prices** - Equilibrium where curves intersect
2. **Demand shocks** - Affect output and prices in same direction
3. **Supply shocks** - Create painful trade-off (stagflation)
4. **Long run is different** - Economy adjusts to potential GDP over time
5. **Output gaps drive policy** - Fed responds to close gaps
6. **Both curves can shift** - Analyze comprehensively
7. **Framework, not forecast** - Use for directional insight, not precision

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Shock Identification
For each event, identify whether it's primarily a demand or supply shock, which direction the curve shifts, and the effect on GDP and prices:
a) Consumer confidence crashes after stock market drop
b) Minimum wage increases by 50%
c) Major hurricane destroys Gulf Coast refineries
d) Central bank cuts interest rates aggressively

### Problem 2: Policy Dilemma
Oil prices spike 100% due to Middle East conflict. Using the AS/AD model:
a) What happens to the SRAS curve?
b) What's the short-run effect on GDP and prices?
c) What's the Fed's dilemma?
d) What are the arguments for raising vs. lowering rates?

### Problem 3: Long-Run Adjustment
The economy is in a significant recessionary gap (unemployment 8%, inflation 0.5%). No policy response occurs. Explain the long-run adjustment process that returns the economy to Y*.
