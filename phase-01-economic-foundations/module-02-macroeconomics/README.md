# Module 2: Macroeconomics

## Overview

Macroeconomics studies the economy as a whole—GDP, inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and international trade. While microeconomics explains firm and consumer behavior, macroeconomics explains the environment in which businesses operate.

For a CEO, macroeconomic understanding is essential for strategic planning, capital allocation, and risk management. Economic conditions determine demand for your products, the cost of capital, labor market dynamics, and competitive intensity.
