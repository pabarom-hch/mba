## Exhibit 2: Currency Exposure Analysis

### Transaction Exposure (Next 12 Months)

**Receivables (Foreign Currency):**

| Currency | Amount | USD Equivalent | Hedged? |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------|
| EUR | €300M | $315M | 60% hedged |
| GBP | £50M | $63M | 50% hedged |
| BRL | R$200M | $34M | 0% hedged |
| MXN | MXN 500M | $27M | 0% hedged |
| Other | Various | $50M | 0% hedged |

| VND | ₫5.5T | $216M | 0% hedged |
| MXN | MXN 2.5B | $135M | 0% hedged |

### Economic Exposure

**Revenue Impact of Currency Moves:**
- 10% USD appreciation → ~3% revenue decline (competitiveness)
- Strongest impact in emerging markets where price sensitivity highest

**Cost Impact of Currency Moves:**
- 10% USD appreciation → ~4% COGS decline (purchasing power)
- Net effect: Margin expansion but revenue risk

### Translation Exposure

| Subsidiary | Functional Currency | Net Assets | Exchange Impact |
|------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Europe | EUR | $150M | 10% EUR move = $15M equity |
| Brazil | BRL | $40M | 15% BRL move = $6M equity |
| Mexico | MXN | $30M | 10% MXN move = $3M equity |

| EUR receivable | €180M | Various (3-12 mo) | 1.12 | -$10M loss |
| CNY payable | ¥1.6B | 6 months | 7.05 | -$8M loss |

**Options:**
- None currently outstanding

**Natural Hedges:**

## Analysis Framework

### Exposure Mapping

**Net Currency Position (Unhedged):**

| Currency | Revenue | Cost | Net Position | Risk Direction |
|----------|---------|------|--------------|----------------|
| EUR | +€300M | -€20M | +€280M | USD strength hurts |
| CNY | +$50M | -$600M | -$550M (CNY terms) | USD strength helps |
| VND | - | -$216M | -$216M (VND terms) | USD strength helps |
| MXN | +$27M | -$135M | -$108M (MXN terms) | USD strength helps |
| BRL | +$34M | - | +$34M (BRL terms) | USD strength hurts |

**Key Insight:** GlobalTech is naturally long USD (more costs than revenue in foreign currency). Strong USD actually helps margins but hurts revenue competitiveness.

### Risk Prioritization

| Exposure | Size | Volatility | Hedge Cost | Priority |
|----------|------|------------|------------|----------|
| EUR receivables | High | Low | Low | Medium |
| CNY payables | Very High | Low | Medium | High |
| VND payables | High | High | High | High |
| MXN payables | Medium | High | High | Medium |
| BRL receivables | Low | Very High | Very High | Low |

### Recommended Hedging Strategy

**Immediate Actions (30 days):**

1. **CNY Payables:**
   - Increase hedge ratio from 40% to 70%
   - Use forwards for 6-12 month horizon
   - Estimated cost: $10M/year
   - Rationale: Largest exposure, manageable cost

2. **VND Payables:**
   - Hedge 50% of exposure
   - Use shorter-dated forwards (3-6 months)
   - Estimated cost: $4M/year
   - Rationale: High volatility justifies cost

3. **EUR Receivables:**
   - Maintain current 60% hedge
   - EUR volatility manageable
   - Natural hedge through EUR expenses

4. **MXN Position:**
   - Net short (payables > receivables)
   - Hedge 50% of net payables
   - Cost: $3M/year

5. **BRL Receivables:**
   - Do not hedge (12% forward cost is prohibitive)
   - Consider operational hedges (local pricing flexibility)
   - Accept as unhedged exposure

**Tail Risk Protection:**
- Purchase OTM put options on BRL (5-10% protection)
- Cost: $2M for 6-month protection
- Protects against severe scenarios

### Operational Response Plan

**If Scenario 3 Begins Unfolding:**

| Action | Trigger | Timeline |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Extend supplier payment terms | VND > 30,000 | Immediate |
| Accelerate receivables (EM) | Country CDS > 500 | Immediate |
| Price increases (EM markets) | Currency down > 20% | 30 days |
| Evaluate customer credit | Any EM | Ongoing |
| Dual-source critical components | Supply disruption | 90 days |
| Adjust inventory levels | Demand uncertainty | 60 days |

### Long-Term Strategic Implications

**Supply Chain Recommendations:**

1. **Nearshoring to Mexico:**
   - Pro: USMCA access, time zone, currency natural hedge (if selling in US)
   - Con: Higher labor cost than Asia
   - Recommendation: Increase Mexico from 10% to 20% of COGS over 3 years

2. **Diversify Asian Manufacturing:**
   - Reduce Vietnam concentration
   - Add India as alternative
   - Maintain China for domestic Chinese market

3. **Revenue/Cost Matching:**
   - Long-term goal: Match revenue and cost currencies
   - Europe: Add EUR-based manufacturing for EUR sales
   - Americas: Mexico supplies US and LatAm

**Investment Plan:**
- $50M over 3 years for supply chain restructuring
- NPV positive if reduces currency volatility by 50%
- Also provides geopolitical risk diversification

## Teaching Note

### Key Learning Points

1. **Three types of exposure matter differently:**
   - Transaction: Can hedge directly
   - Translation: Accounting impact, limited real effect
   - Economic: Strategic issue, requires operational response

2. **Natural positions matter:**
   - GlobalTech is naturally long USD (manufacturing costs > export revenue)
   - Strong USD helps margins but hurts competitiveness
   - Net exposure analysis essential

3. **Hedge costs vs. risks:**
   - Low-volatility currencies (EUR, CNY): Hedge
   - High-volatility but high-cost (BRL): Operational solutions
   - Match hedge tenor to exposure timing

4. **Options for tail risk:**
   - Forwards lock in rates (both sides)
   - Options provide floor while keeping upside
   - Use for extreme scenarios

5. **Strategic response beyond hedging:**
   - Supply chain restructuring
   - Revenue/cost currency matching
   - Pricing flexibility
   - Customer credit management

### Common Mistakes

- **Viewing strong USD as purely positive** - Ignores revenue competitiveness
- **Hedging everything** - Some exposures too expensive to hedge
- **Ignoring natural hedges** - Miss offsetting positions
- **Only financial hedges** - Operational responses often more effective
- **Static analysis** - Scenarios change; build flexible response

### Excellent vs. Good Answers

**Good Answer:**
"Hedge all exposures to reduce volatility."

**Excellent Answer:**
"GlobalTech is naturally long USD with manufacturing costs exceeding foreign currency revenue. While strong USD benefits margins, it hurts revenue competitiveness.

Prioritized hedging: CNY payables (70% hedge, largest exposure, reasonable cost), VND (50% hedge, high volatility), EUR (maintain 60%), BRL (unhedge, cost prohibitive - use operational flexibility instead).

Beyond hedging, implement operational responses: extend supplier terms, accelerate EM receivables, evaluate customer credit. Long-term, restructure supply chain for natural currency matching—increase Mexico operations to serve Americas, add India manufacturing diversity.

Cost: $16M annually for 50% volatility reduction. Recommend board approval and supply chain study authorization."
