Develop three scenarios (mild downturn, moderate recession, severe recession) with specific revenue and margin assumptions for Meridian. What leading indicators would you watch to determine which scenario is unfolding?

### Question 3: Strategic Response

Which strategic option (A, B, or C) do you recommend, and why? What modifications would you make to the chosen option?

### Question 4: Implementation Timeline

Create a specific timeline for key actions. What triggers would cause you to accelerate or decelerate the response?

### Question 5: Stakeholder Communication

How would you communicate this strategy to key stakeholders: board of directors, employees, customers, and lenders?

## Analysis Framework

### Cycle Assessment

**Current Phase: Late-cycle expansion with elevated recession risk**

Evidence:
- Yield curve inverted for 12+ months (historically predictive)
- Leading Economic Index declining 8 consecutive months
- Manufacturing PMI below 50 (contraction)
- Initial claims rising
- Consumer confidence falling
- Sector-specific indicators weakening

**Recession Probability:**
- 12-month recession probability: 60-70%
- Timing: Q2-Q3 2025 most likely
- Severity: Moderate (not 2008-level, but meaningful)

### Scenario Development

| Scenario | Probability | Revenue Impact | Duration |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Soft landing | 30% | -5% to -10% | 6-9 months |
| Moderate recession | 50% | -15% to -25% | 12-18 months |
| Severe recession | 20% | -30% to -40% | 18-24 months |

**Leading Indicators to Monitor:**

| Indicator | Soft Landing | Moderate | Severe |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Initial claims | < 280K | 280-350K | > 350K |
| ISM Manufacturing | > 48 | 45-48 | < 45 |
| Rental utilization | > 75% | 65-75% | < 65% |
| Order backlog | -10% | -20% | -30% |

### Strategic Recommendation

**Recommended: Modified Option B (Balanced Response with Offensive Elements)**

**Rationale:**
1. Financial position is strong (2.2x leverage, $145M liquidity)
2. 2008-2009 showed delayed action hurt margins
3. But also showed aggressive recovery investment paid off
4. Competitors vary in preparedness - opportunity exists
5. Countercyclical strategy creates lasting advantage

**Specific Actions:**

**Immediate (Days 1-30):**
1. Freeze all non-essential hiring
2. Reduce discretionary spending (travel, consultants) - $8M savings
3. Accelerate receivables collection
4. Review supplier contracts for renegotiation
5. Communicate preparedness to board and lenders

**Short-term (Months 1-6):**
1. Develop workforce reduction plan (ready to execute, not yet implemented)
2. Identify 10% workforce reduction if needed ($25M)
3. Reduce CapEx 25% ($12M cash)
4. Extend payables where appropriate
5. Begin acquisition target identification
6. Maintain R&D investments (competitive differentiation)

**Contingent Actions (Triggered by Indicators):**
1. If ISM < 45 for two consecutive months → Execute workforce reduction
2. If order backlog down > 20% → Accelerate cost cuts
3. If competitor distress visible → Accelerate M&A pursuit
4. If cash < $50M → Implement emergency cost reductions

**Offensive Elements:**
1. Create M&A war chest (maintain revolver availability)
2. Identify top talent at competitors
3. Strengthen key dealer relationships
4. Document acquisition targets with DD prep

### Implementation Timeline

| Timeframe | Actions | Triggers |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Nov 2024** | Discretionary freeze, hiring freeze, collections push | Immediate |
| **Dec 2024** | CapEx reduction, supplier negotiations begin | - |
| **Q1 2025** | Monitor indicators, finalize cost plans | ISM < 47 |
| **Q2 2025** | Execute layoffs if warranted | Order backlog -15% |
| **Q3 2025** | Evaluate acquisition opportunities | Competitor distress |
| **Q4 2025** | Recovery positioning | Leading indicators improve |

### Stakeholder Communication

**Board of Directors:**
- Present full scenario analysis
- Recommend balanced approach with contingencies
- Seek approval for potential M&A activity
- Request delegation authority for rapid action
- Monthly updates with trigger assessment

**Employees:**
- Honest communication about environment
- Emphasize company's strong financial position
- Explain no immediate layoffs planned
- Prepare people for potential actions
- Recognize that uncertainty is harder than bad news

**Customers:**
- Reinforce financial stability
- Emphasize service continuity
- Offer flexible terms if appropriate
- Strengthen key relationships

**Lenders:**
- Proactive communication
- Share scenario analysis and response plan
- Demonstrate covenant headroom
- Request refinancing if appropriate timing

## Teaching Note

### Key Learning Points

1. **Read economic indicators correctly** - Yield curve inversion, LEI decline, sector indicators all pointing to elevated recession risk

2. **Know your business cyclicality** - Construction equipment highly cyclical (2-3x GDP beta)

3. **Learn from history** - 2008-2009 experience: delayed action hurt, late investment helped recovery

4. **Balance defense and offense** - Pure defense loses share; pure offense risks survival

5. **Prepare contingent plans** - Specific triggers prevent over- or under-reaction

6. **Communicate proactively** - Stakeholder management crucial during uncertainty

### Common Mistakes

- **Waiting for official recession declaration** - By then, 6-12 months too late
- **Pure defensive posture** - Protects margin but loses competitive position
- **Ignoring sector-specific indicators** - Construction leads general economy
- **Not having triggers** - Leads to either paralysis or panic
- **Poor stakeholder communication** - Creates uncertainty and talent flight

### Excellent vs. Good Answers

**Good Answer:**
"Given economic indicators, we should cut costs now to protect margins."

**Excellent Answer:**
"The economic indicators suggest 60-70% recession probability within 12 months. Given our strong financial position (2.2x leverage, $145M liquidity), we should take a balanced approach: implement modest immediate cuts ($20M), prepare larger contingent reductions, but maintain offensive capacity for acquisitions and talent hiring. Specific triggers (ISM < 45, backlog -20%) will determine escalation. Communication plan addresses all stakeholders proactively."
