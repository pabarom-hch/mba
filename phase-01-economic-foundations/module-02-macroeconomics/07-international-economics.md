## Introduction

In a globalized economy, international economics is no longer optional knowledge. Exchange rates affect import costs and export competitiveness. Trade policies reshape supply chains. Capital flows move markets. For any CEO with international operations, suppliers, or competitors, this is core knowledge.

## Core Concepts

### Exchange Rates

**Definition:** The price of one currency in terms of another.

**Types of Exchange Rates:**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Spot rate** | Current exchange rate | $1 = €0.92 today |
| **Forward rate** | Rate for future delivery | $1 = €0.90 in 6 months |
| **Real exchange rate** | Adjusted for inflation | Competitiveness measure |
| **Effective rate** | Trade-weighted average | Overall currency strength |

**Quotation Conventions:**
```
Direct quote (for US): USD per foreign currency
  - $1.30/€1 means 1 euro costs $1.30

Indirect quote (for US): Foreign currency per USD
  - €0.77/$1 means 1 dollar buys €0.77

These are inverse: 1/1.30 = 0.77
```

### Exchange Rate Determination

**Short-Run: Interest Rate Parity**
```
Forward Premium/Discount ≈ Interest Rate Differential

If US rate = 5%, EU rate = 3%
Forward rate should show € at ~2% premium to spot

Why: Arbitrage equalizes returns across currencies
```

**Medium-Run: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)**
```
Exchange Rate Change ≈ Inflation Differential

If US inflation = 3%, Japan inflation = 1%
JPY should appreciate ~2% vs. USD

Why: Goods arbitrage (in theory)
```

**Long-Run: Fundamental Factors**
- Productivity growth differentials
- Terms of trade
- Current account balances
- Government debt levels
- Political stability

### Exchange Rate Regimes

| Regime | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Floating** | Market-determined | USD, EUR, JPY, GBP |
| **Managed float** | Mostly market, with intervention | Many emerging markets |
| **Pegged** | Fixed to another currency | Hong Kong (USD), Denmark (EUR) |
| **Currency board** | Strict peg with full backing | Historically Argentina |
| **Dollarization** | Use foreign currency | Ecuador, Panama |

### Balance of Payments

**Components:**

```
Current Account
├── Trade balance (goods)
├── Services balance
├── Income (investment returns)
└── Transfers (remittances)

Capital Account
├── Direct investment (FDI)
├── Portfolio investment (stocks, bonds)
└── Other (bank flows, reserves)

Current Account + Capital Account = 0 (in theory)
```

**US Current Account:**
- Persistent deficit (~3-4% of GDP)
- Imports exceed exports
- Financed by capital inflows (foreigners buy US assets)
- Sustainable? Debated.

### Trade Policy

**Tools:**

| Tool | Description | Effect |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Tariffs** | Tax on imports | Raises prices, protects domestic producers |
| **Quotas** | Quantity limits | Similar to tariffs but more restrictive |
| **Subsidies** | Support domestic producers | Makes exports cheaper |
| **Technical barriers** | Standards, regulations | Can exclude foreign products |
| **Anti-dumping** | Against below-cost imports | Protects from "unfair" competition |

**Trade Agreements:**
- WTO: Global rules-based system
- Regional: USMCA, EU, etc.
- Bilateral: Country-specific deals

### Comparative Advantage

**Ricardo's Insight:** Countries benefit from trade by specializing in what they do relatively better, even if they're absolutely worse at everything.

**Example:**
```
Output per worker per day:
           Wine    Cloth
Portugal    4        2
England     1        1

Portugal is better at both (absolute advantage)
But ratio: Portugal 4:2 = 2:1 in wine; England 1:1 = 1:1

Portugal has comparative advantage in wine (4/2 > 1/1)
England has comparative advantage in cloth (1/1 > 2/4)

Both benefit if Portugal makes wine, England makes cloth, they trade.
```

## Currency Risk Management

### Types of Currency Exposure

**1. Transaction Exposure**
- Risk from contractual foreign currency obligations
- Example: Receivable in euros due in 90 days
- Can be hedged with forwards, options

**2. Translation Exposure**
- Risk from consolidating foreign subsidiaries
- Example: European subsidiary assets on US parent balance sheet
- Accounting exposure, doesn't affect cash flow

**3. Economic (Operating) Exposure**
- Risk to competitive position from currency moves
- Example: Strong dollar makes US exports less competitive
- Hardest to hedge, requires strategic response

### Hedging Strategies

**Forward Contracts:**
```
Situation: US company expects €10M in 90 days
Risk: Euro weakens vs. dollar
Action: Sell €10M forward at today's forward rate
Result: Lock in dollar amount regardless of spot rate in 90 days
```

**Options:**
```
Situation: Same as above
Risk: Euro weakens, BUT might strengthen
Action: Buy put option on €10M (right to sell at strike)
Result: Protected if euro falls, benefit if euro rises
Cost: Option premium (like insurance)
```

**Natural Hedges:**
- Match foreign currency revenues with expenses
- Borrow in foreign currency for foreign operations
- Produce where you sell

### Hedging Decision Framework

| Factor | Hedge More | Hedge Less |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Currency volatility | High | Low |
| Profit margins | Thin | Wide |
| Competition | Heavy forex users | Similar exposure |
| Financial strength | Weak | Strong |
| Forecast certainty | High | Low |

**Key Principle:** Hedge to reduce risk, not to speculate on currencies.

## Consulting Application

### Country Risk Assessment

**Framework:**

| Category | Factors | Data Sources |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Economic** | GDP growth, inflation, current account | IMF, World Bank |
| **Political** | Stability, rule of law, corruption | Political risk indices |
| **Financial** | Banking system, currency stability | Rating agencies, BIS |
| **Operational** | Infrastructure, labor, regulation | Doing Business rankings |

**Country Risk Score Card:**

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-10) | Weighted |
|--------|--------|--------------|----------|
| Economic growth | 20% | 7 | 1.4 |
| Inflation stability | 15% | 5 | 0.75 |
| Political stability | 20% | 6 | 1.2 |
| Currency stability | 15% | 4 | 0.6 |
| Rule of law | 15% | 6 | 0.9 |
| Business environment | 15% | 7 | 1.05 |
| **Total** | 100% | | **5.9** |

### Trade War Impact Analysis

**Framework for Assessing Tariff Impact:**

**Direct Effects:**
1. Cost increase on imported inputs
2. Price competitiveness of exports
3. Retaliation effects on your exports

**Indirect Effects:**
1. Supply chain disruption
2. Demand changes (consumer response)
3. Competitor position changes
4. Currency adjustments

**Example Analysis:**

```
Client: US consumer electronics company
Event: 25% tariff on Chinese imports

Direct Impact:
- 60% of COGS from China = $600M
- Tariff cost: $600M × 25% = $150M
- Options:
  a) Absorb ($150M margin hit)
  b) Pass through (estimated 50% volume decline)
  c) Partial pass-through + source shift

Indirect Impact:
- Competitors with different supply chains advantage
- China may retaliate on other products
- Currency may partially offset

Recommendation: 50% pass-through + accelerated supply chain shift
```

## CEO Application

### International Expansion Decisions

**Market Entry Framework:**

| Factor | Considerations |
|--------|---------------|
| **Market size** | Current and projected GDP, target segment |
| **Growth potential** | Economic trajectory, demographic trends |
| **Competition** | Local competitors, other multinationals |
| **Market access** | Tariffs, regulations, distribution |
| **Operational costs** | Labor, real estate, logistics |
| **Currency** | Volatility, trend, hedgeability |
| **Risk** | Political, economic, legal |

**Entry Mode Options:**

Total Landed Cost =
  Purchase price
+ Freight
+ Tariffs/duties
+ Inventory carrying cost (longer supply chain)
+ Currency risk cost
+ Quality/compliance risk
+ Flexibility cost

Compare across sourcing options
```

**Diversification Strategy:**
- China +1 (add alternative to China)
- Regional hubs (Americas, Europe, Asia)
- Nearshoring (Mexico for US market)
- Friend-shoring (ally countries)

### Currency Strategy for Multinationals

**Strategic Currency Exposure Management:**

| Revenue Currency | Cost Currency | Natural Exposure | Strategic Response |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| USD | USD | Neutral | None needed |
| USD | EUR | Short EUR | Consider EUR debt |
| EUR | USD | Short USD | Consider US production |
| Mixed | Mixed | Complex | Full analysis needed |

**Treasury Policy Elements:**
1. Define exposure tolerance
2. Mandatory hedging for specific exposures
3. Approved hedging instruments
4. Reporting requirements
5. Performance measurement

## Worked Example

### Situation

US-based industrial equipment manufacturer considering European expansion:
- Current: $500M revenue, 100% US
- Opportunity: €100M potential in Germany/France
- Entry options: Export vs. acquire local distributor
- Currency: EUR/USD = 1.10 (recent range 1.05-1.20)

### Analysis

**Market Assessment:**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Market size | €5B addressable market, growing 3%/year |
| Competition | 2 strong European players, 3 Asian |
| Our positioning | Premium product, technology advantage |
| Customer need | Strong demand for our category |
| Barriers | CE certification (have it), local relationships (don't have) |

**Entry Mode Analysis:**

**Option 1: Export from US**
```
Revenue potential: €50M (limited by distribution)
Gross margin: 35% (after freight, duties)
Investment: $5M (sales team, marketing)
Currency exposure: 100% EUR revenue
Break-even: Year 2
NPV (10%): $15M
```

**Option 2: Acquire Distributor**
```
Revenue potential: €100M (stronger market access)
Gross margin: 40% (local service capability)
Investment: $50M acquisition + $10M integration
Currency exposure: EUR revenue, some EUR costs
Break-even: Year 3
NPV (10%): $35M
```

**Currency Analysis:**

EUR/USD scenarios:
| Scenario | Rate | EUR Revenue (M) | USD Equivalent |
|----------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Strong EUR | 1.20 | €100 | $120M |
| Base case | 1.10 | €100 | $110M |
| Weak EUR | 1.00 | €100 | $100M |

Currency volatility adds ±$10M revenue risk annually.

**Hedging Strategy:**
- Hedge 75% of expected EUR revenue with forwards
- Roll hedges quarterly
- Consider EUR debt for acquisition to create natural hedge

**Recommendation:**

Acquire distributor (Option 2):
1. Higher NPV despite larger investment
2. Faster path to scale in important market
3. Local presence provides competitive advantage
4. Acquisition financing in EUR creates natural hedge
5. Platform for further European expansion

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Thorough due diligence on acquisition target
- Hedge first 2 years of EUR exposure
- Maintain US production (don't shift prematurely)
- Build local team carefully

## Historical Case: Asian Financial Crisis (1997-98)

**What Happened:**
1. Thailand fixed baht to USD despite rising current account deficit
2. Currency speculators attacked the peg
3. Thailand abandoned peg; baht collapsed 50%
4. Contagion spread to Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines
5. IMF bailouts with strict conditions

**Impact on Businesses:**
- Companies with USD debt and local revenue devastated
- Dollar-earning exporters benefited
- Foreign investors suffered massive losses
- Supply chains disrupted

**Lessons for CEOs:**
1. **Currency mismatch kills** - Match debt currency to revenue
2. **Fixed exchange rates can break** - Don't assume stability
3. **Contagion spreads** - Regional risk, not just country risk
4. **Liquidity disappears** - Maintain reserves
5. **Opportunity in crisis** - Best companies entered post-crisis

**Business Response:**
- Strong multinationals acquired distressed assets cheaply
- Supply chain shifts (to lower-cost crisis countries)
- Enhanced currency risk management globally
- Country risk assessment became standard

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Currency in Business Decisions
**Mistake:** Evaluating international opportunities in local currency only.
**Reality:** Currency can make or break an investment. Model scenarios.

### 2. Speculating Instead of Hedging
**Mistake:** Taking views on currency direction in hedging.
**Reality:** Hedge to reduce risk, not to profit from currency moves.

### 3. Underestimating Transaction Costs
**Mistake:** Using spot rates for projections.
**Reality:** Include bid-ask spread, forward points, hedging costs.

### 4. Ignoring Sovereign Risk
**Mistake:** Treating all countries as similarly risky.
**Reality:** Country risk varies enormously. Assess systematically.

### 5. Static Supply Chain
**Mistake:** Not adapting supply chain to trade policy changes.
**Reality:** Trade policy is dynamic. Build flexibility.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Exchange rates are prices** - Determined by interest rates, inflation, fundamentals
2. **PPP holds long-run** - Currencies move toward purchasing power equilibrium
3. **Three exposures exist** - Transaction, translation, economic—each requires different response
4. **Hedge to reduce risk** - Not to make money on currency
5. **Trade policy reshapes competition** - Monitor and adapt supply chains
6. **Country risk assessment essential** - Use systematic framework
7. **Currency mismatch is dangerous** - Match revenues and debt currencies

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Exchange Rate Calculation
The current EUR/USD spot rate is 1.12 (1 EUR = 1.12 USD). US interest rates are 5%, European rates are 3%.
a) Calculate the theoretical 1-year forward rate.
b) If the actual forward rate is 1.08, what arbitrage opportunity exists?
c) What would make the forward rate deviate from interest rate parity?

### Problem 2: Currency Hedging
Your company will receive ¥500 million in 6 months from a Japanese customer.
Current spot: ¥145/$1
6-month forward: ¥143/$1
ATM put option: 2% premium

a) What is the unhedged dollar value at current spot?
b) What is the hedged value using forward?
c) What is the floor value using the put option? At what spot rate would you prefer the option?

### Problem 3: Sourcing Decision
You're comparing suppliers:
- US supplier: $100 per unit
- Mexican supplier: 1,800 MXN per unit (current rate: 17 MXN/$1)
- Chinese supplier: 650 CNY per unit (current rate: 7.2 CNY/$1)

a) Calculate current USD cost from each supplier.
b) How much would each foreign currency need to depreciate to make the US supplier competitive?
c) What non-price factors should influence this decision?
