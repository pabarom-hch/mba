## Introduction

The banking system is the circulatory system of the economy, channeling savings to investment and creating the money supply through lending. When this system functions well, it's invisible. When it fails, economies collapse.

For CEOs, understanding banking and credit is essential for managing working capital, planning capital structure, and recognizing when financial conditions pose systemic risk.

## Core Concepts

### What Is Money?

**Functions of Money:**
1. **Medium of exchange** - Accepted for transactions
2. **Unit of account** - Prices quoted in money terms
3. **Store of value** - Maintains purchasing power over time

**Types of Money:**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **M0 (Base Money)** | Currency + bank reserves at Fed | Physical cash |
| **M1 (Narrow Money)** | M0 + checking accounts | Day-to-day transactions |
| **M2 (Broad Money)** | M1 + savings, small time deposits | Total liquid savings |

**Modern Money:**
Most money is digital—numbers in bank accounts, not physical cash. Banks create this money through lending.

### How Banks Create Money

**The Money Multiplier Process:**

```
Step 1: Fed creates $1,000 in reserves
Step 2: Bank A lends $900 (keeping 10% reserve)
Step 3: Borrower deposits $900 at Bank B
Step 4: Bank B lends $810 (keeping 10% reserve)
Step 5: Process continues...

Total money created = $1,000 × (1/reserve ratio)
If reserve ratio = 10%, multiplier = 10
$1,000 base money → $10,000 total money supply
```

**Visual Representation:**
```
Fed creates $1,000 base money
        │
        ▼
Bank A: Receives $1,000
        Keeps $100 reserve
        Lends $900 ──────────▶ Borrower spends at Business X
                                      │
                                      ▼
                              Business X deposits $900 at Bank B
                                      │
                                      ▼
                              Bank B: Keeps $90 reserve
                                      Lends $810 ───────▶ Continues...
```

**Reality Check:**
- Actual multiplier is much lower (banks don't fully lend)
- Depends on bank willingness to lend
- Depends on borrower demand for loans
- Regulatory constraints matter

### The Role of Central Banks

**Federal Reserve Functions:**

1. **Monetary policy** - Set interest rates, control money supply
2. **Bank supervision** - Regulate and examine banks
3. **Lender of last resort** - Provide emergency liquidity
4. **Payment system** - Operate check clearing, wire transfers
5. **Financial stability** - Monitor and address systemic risk

**The Fed's Balance Sheet:**

| Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|-------------|
| Government securities | Currency in circulation |
| Loans to banks | Bank reserves |
| Foreign currencies | |

**QE expands the balance sheet:**
- Fed buys securities
- Pays with newly created reserves
- Money supply increases

### Bank Balance Sheet

**Typical Commercial Bank:**

```
ASSETS                          LIABILITIES
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Cash & Reserves      5%         Deposits           85%
Securities          20%         Borrowings         10%
Loans               70%         ─────────────────────
Other                5%         EQUITY              5%
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Total             100%         Total             100%
```

**Key Ratios:**

| Ratio | Formula | Significance |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Leverage** | Assets/Equity | Higher = more risk |
| **Reserve Ratio** | Reserves/Deposits | Liquidity buffer |
| **Capital Ratio** | Equity/Risk-weighted Assets | Regulatory requirement |
| **Loan-to-Deposit** | Loans/Deposits | Lending intensity |

### Credit Conditions

**Credit Spreads:**
```
Credit Spread = Corporate bond yield - Treasury yield

Example:
BBB corporate bond: 6.5%
10-year Treasury: 4.0%
Credit spread: 2.5% (250 basis points)
```

**What Spreads Tell You:**

| Spread Level | Interpretation | Environment |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| < 100 bps | Very tight, risk-on | Easy credit |
| 100-200 bps | Normal | Healthy markets |
| 200-400 bps | Elevated | Caution emerging |
| > 400 bps | Stressed | Credit crunch possible |
| > 600 bps | Crisis | Severe distress |

**Leading Indicator:** Credit spreads widen before recessions as lenders become risk-averse.

## Financial Crises

### Anatomy of a Banking Crisis

**Typical Pattern:**

```
1. Boom
   - Easy credit
   - Asset prices rise
   - Leverage increases
   - Risk underpriced

2. Trigger
   - Asset prices peak
   - Losses emerge
   - Confidence shaken

3. Panic
   - Bank runs
   - Fire sales
   - Credit contracts
   - Contagion spreads

4. Policy Response
   - Liquidity injection
   - Bank recapitalization
   - Guarantees

5. Resolution
   - Bad assets resolved
   - Banks rebuilt
   - Regulation tightened
```

### Historical Crises

**2008 Global Financial Crisis:**

| Phase | Events |
|-------|--------|
| **Boom** | Housing bubble, subprime lending, MBS proliferation |
| **Trigger** | Subprime defaults rise, Bear Stearns fails |
| **Panic** | Lehman bankruptcy, AIG near-failure, money market run |
| **Response** | TARP, Fed facilities, FDIC guarantees, QE |
| **Resolution** | Bank recapitalization, Dodd-Frank regulation |

**Key Lessons:**
1. Leverage amplifies losses
2. Interconnection creates contagion
3. Liquidity can evaporate instantly
4. Government intervention necessary in systemic crises
5. "This time is different" is usually wrong

**SVB Crisis 2023:**

| Phase | Events |
|-------|--------|
| **Boom** | VC funding surge, deposit growth, bond purchases |
| **Trigger** | Interest rates rise, bond portfolio underwater |
| **Panic** | Depositors flee (social media accelerated), stock crashes |
| **Response** | FDIC seizure, depositor guarantee, Fed facility |
| **Resolution** | Ongoing regulatory review |

**Key Lessons:**
1. Duration risk (asset-liability mismatch) kills
2. Concentrated deposits are risky (tech startups)
3. Social media accelerates bank runs
4. Even "safe" assets can cause failure
5. Deposit concentration matters

### Warning Signs of Financial Stress

**Early Warning Indicators:**

| Indicator | Warning Signal |
|-----------|---------------|
| Credit spreads | Widening rapidly |
| TED spread | Rising above 50 bps |
| VIX | Spiking above 30 |
| Commercial paper | Rates spiking, issuance falling |
| Bank CDS | Rising sharply |
| Interbank lending | Freezing up |
| Repo rates | Spiking (liquidity shortage) |

**Macro Indicators:**
- Rapid credit growth (preceding boom)
- Housing prices vs. income (bubble indicator)
- Corporate leverage increasing
- Risk premiums compressed

## Consulting Application

### Credit Analysis Framework

**Step 1: Assess Overall Credit Conditions**
- Where are spreads?
- Are they tightening or widening?
- What's driving the trend?

**Step 2: Evaluate Client-Specific Access**
- Credit rating
- Banking relationships
- Covenant compliance
- Refinancing calendar

**Step 3: Stress Test**
- What if spreads widen 200 bps?
- What if banks reduce availability?
- What if commercial paper markets freeze?

**Step 4: Recommend Actions**
- Liquidity buffers
- Financing diversification
- Covenant headroom

### Working Capital and Credit

**Credit Conditions Affect Working Capital:**

| Tight Credit | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| Suppliers | May demand faster payment |
| Customers | May delay payment |
| Inventory | Harder to finance |
| Seasonality | Harder to bridge |

**Recommendations for Tight Credit:**
1. Accelerate collections
2. Negotiate extended payment terms
3. Reduce inventory levels
4. Secure committed credit lines
5. Identify alternative financing sources

## CEO Application

### Liquidity Management

**Cash Management Priorities:**

1. **Operating cushion** - 3-6 months expenses minimum
2. **Credit line backup** - Committed facilities
3. **Diversified sources** - Multiple banks, capital sources
4. **Early warning system** - Monitor credit indicators

**Liquidity Stress Test:**
```
Scenario: Credit markets freeze for 6 months

Current cash: $50M
Monthly cash burn: $8M
Survival without credit: 6 months

Actions needed:
- Cut discretionary spending: Save $2M/month
- Accelerate receivables: One-time $10M
- Delay payables: Extend from 30 to 45 days
- Extended survival: 12 months
```

### Banking Relationships

**Relationship Value:**
- Access during tight markets
- Better pricing and terms
- Early warning on industry trends
- M&A introductions
- Treasury services

**Managing Bank Relationships:**
1. Maintain 2-3 key relationships
2. Regular communication (quarterly meetings)
3. Share business plans and forecasts
4. Don't surprise them
5. Ensure compliance with covenants

### Monitoring Financial Stability

**Create a Financial Conditions Dashboard:**

| Indicator | Current | Warning Level | Action Trigger |
|-----------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| IG spreads | 150 bps | > 250 bps | Review financing |
| HY spreads | 400 bps | > 600 bps | Accelerate refinancing |
| Bank stock index | -5% YTD | > -20% | Review bank exposure |
| Fed stress | Low | Elevated | Increase liquidity |

## Worked Example

### Situation

You're CFO of a mid-sized manufacturer. It's Q3 2024. You're observing:

- Credit spreads widening (IG from 100 to 175 bps)
- Bank lending standards tightening
- Your company: BBB- rated, $200M revolver ($150M drawn)
- Maturity: 18 months away
- Covenant: Debt/EBITDA < 3.5x (currently at 3.0x)

### Analysis

**Credit Environment Assessment:**
- Spreads widening but not crisis level
- Banks becoming cautious
- Your rating is borderline investment grade
- Covenant cushion exists but not large

**Risk Assessment:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Priority |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Spreads widen further | 40% | Higher refinancing cost | Medium |
| Rating downgrade | 20% | Loss of investment grade | High |
| Covenant breach | 15% | Technical default | High |
| Bank reduces commitment | 25% | Liquidity pressure | High |

**Action Plan:**

**Immediate (30 days):**
1. Meet with bank group - discuss early refinancing
2. Review covenant projections - ensure buffer maintained
3. Identify alternative liquidity sources

**Short-term (90 days):**
1. Initiate refinancing discussions
2. Consider partial paydown to reduce leverage
3. Build operating cash buffer

**Contingency:**
1. Prepare asset sale list if needed
2. Identify cost reductions to protect EBITDA
3. Model covenant waivers/amendments

### Refinancing Analysis

**Current Situation:**
- $150M drawn at SOFR + 175 bps
- Current rate: ~7% all-in
- Annual interest: $10.5M

**Refinancing Options:**

| Option | Rate | Annual Cost | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|-------------|------|------|
| Stay current | 7% | $10.5M | No action needed | Maturity risk |
| Refinance now | 8% | $12.0M | Remove uncertainty | Higher cost |
| Partial paydown + refi | 7.5% on $100M | $7.5M | Lower risk | Uses cash |
| Term loan + revolver | 8.5% | $12.75M | More certainty | Expensive |

**Recommendation:** Refinance now at slightly higher cost to remove maturity risk. In tightening credit environment, certainty has value.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Assuming Credit Is Always Available
**Mistake:** Taking bank financing for granted.
**Reality:** Credit can disappear quickly. Maintain relationships and buffers.

### 2. Ignoring Early Warning Signs
**Mistake:** Waiting for crisis to act.
**Reality:** By the time crisis hits, options are limited. Act early.

### 3. Over-Reliance on Single Bank
**Mistake:** Concentrating banking relationships.
**Reality:** Banks can fail or pull back. Diversify.

### 4. Maximizing Leverage in Good Times
**Mistake:** Running at maximum debt capacity.
**Reality:** Leaves no cushion for stress. Maintain flexibility.

### 5. Covenant Complacency
**Mistake:** Not monitoring covenants actively.
**Reality:** Breaches can trigger cascading problems. Monitor closely.

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Money Creation
If the Fed injects $10B in base money and the reserve ratio is 8%:
a) What's the theoretical money multiplier?
b) What's the maximum money supply increase?
c) Why might actual money creation be less?

### Problem 2: Crisis Analysis
Credit spreads have widened from 150 bps to 350 bps over 3 months. Bank stocks are down 25%.
a) What phase of a potential crisis might this represent?
b) What actions should a CFO take immediately?
c) What leading indicators would you monitor for further deterioration?

### Problem 3: Liquidity Planning
Your company has:
- Cash: $20M
- Undrawn credit line: $50M (expires in 9 months)
- Monthly operating expenses: $5M
- Major debt maturity: $100M in 12 months

Credit conditions are tightening. Develop a liquidity action plan.
