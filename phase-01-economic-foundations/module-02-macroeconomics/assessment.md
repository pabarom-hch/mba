## Answer Key

### Section A

**Q1:** GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given period.

Components:
- C (Consumer Spending): Household purchases - ~68% of US GDP (largest)
- I (Investment): Business fixed investment, residential, inventory changes - ~18%
- G (Government Spending): Federal, state, local purchases (not transfers) - ~17%
- (X-M) (Net Exports): Exports minus imports - typically negative for US

**Q2:**
- CPI (Consumer Price Index): Measures price changes for a fixed basket of consumer goods and services, including food and energy
- Core CPI: Excludes food and energy prices (which are volatile)

The Fed prefers Core PCE because:
1. It excludes volatile food/energy prices that don't reflect underlying trends
2. PCE adjusts for substitution effects (when people switch to cheaper alternatives)
3. PCE covers broader spending than CPI
4. Less affected by short-term supply shocks

**Q3:**
Leading indicators (predict future activity):
- Yield curve slope
- Building permits
- Stock market
- Initial jobless claims (inverted)
- Manufacturing new orders

Coincident indicators (track current activity):
- Real GDP
- Industrial production
- Nonfarm payroll employment
- Personal income

Lagging indicators (confirm trends):
- Unemployment rate
- Average duration of unemployment
- Corporate profits
- Prime rate

**Q4:** An inverted yield curve typically signals an impending recession, usually within 12-18 months. This indicator has preceded every US recession since 1955.

Reliability: Very high - only one significant false positive (1966). However, timing varies (recession can be 6-24 months away). It reflects market expectations that the Fed will need to cut rates due to economic weakness.

**Q5:**
Real GDP growth = Nominal GDP growth - GDP deflator change
Real GDP growth = 6% - 4% = 2%

This matters because:
- Nominal growth overstates economic expansion when prices rise
- Real growth measures actual increase in goods/services produced
- Business planning needs volume projections (real) not just dollar projections (nominal)
- Comparing across years requires inflation adjustment

### Section B

**Q6:** Four phases:

1. **Expansion (Recovery)**
- GDP growing
- Unemployment falling
- Consumer confidence rising
- Business investment increasing
- Credit conditions easing

2. **Peak**
- Economy at full capacity
- Unemployment at lows
- Inflation pressures building
- Asset prices elevated
- Central bank tightening

3. **Contraction (Recession)**
- GDP declining (two+ quarters negative)
- Unemployment rising
- Consumer spending falling
- Business investment declining
- Credit tightening

4. **Trough**
- Economy at bottom
- Unemployment peaks
- Inventories depleted
- Valuations attractive
- Policy support maximum

**Q7:** Luxury retailer has higher economic beta (more cyclical) than discount retailer:

Luxury retailer:
- Revenues rise faster in expansion (discretionary spending increases)
- Revenues fall faster in recession (first to be cut from budgets)
- Beta typically 1.5-2.5x GDP

Discount retailer:
- May be counter-cyclical (consumers trade down in recession)
- Relatively stable in expansion
- Beta near 1.0 or even negative

Example: In 2008 recession, luxury sales dropped 30-40% while Walmart and dollar stores gained share.

**Q8:** Countercyclical strategy means doing the opposite of what most companies do - investing when others retreat, building cash when others spend.

Three recession actions for recovery positioning:
1. **Acquire distressed competitors** - Valuations low, financing may be available, competitors weakened
2. **Hire top talent** - Labor market looser, access to A-players who wouldn't leave in good times
3. **Invest in R&D/product development** - Maintain long-term capabilities while competitors cut, launch new products into recovery

### Section C

**Q9:** [Diagram showing:]
- Vertical axis: Price Level (P)
- Horizontal axis: Real GDP (Y)
- LRAS: Vertical line at Y* (potential GDP)
- SRAS: Upward sloping curve
- AD: Downward sloping curve
- Equilibrium at intersection of all three at (Y*, P*)

**Q10:**
a) Consumer confidence drops: AD shifts LEFT
- GDP falls, prices fall
- Demand shock, negative

b) Oil prices spike 100%: SRAS shifts LEFT
- GDP falls, prices rise (stagflation)
- Supply shock, negative

c) Infrastructure bill: AD shifts RIGHT
- GDP rises, prices rise
- Demand shock, positive (government spending component)

d) Central bank raises rates: AD shifts LEFT
- GDP falls, prices fall
- Demand shock, negative (higher cost of capital reduces investment and consumption)

**Q11:** Stagflation = simultaneous stagnation (low/negative growth) and inflation (high prices)

AS/AD explanation:
- Negative supply shock (like oil price spike) shifts SRAS left
- Equilibrium moves to lower Y (recession) and higher P (inflation)
- Unlike demand shocks where Y and P move together, supply shocks cause opposite movements

Policy dilemma:
- Stimulating to fight recession would worsen inflation (AD shifts right → even higher P)
- Fighting inflation with tight policy would deepen recession (AD shifts left → even lower Y)
- No good option with traditional demand-side tools

Historical event: 1970s oil shocks (OPEC embargo 1973, Iranian revolution 1979) caused severe stagflation. Fed ultimately chose to fight inflation (Volcker tightening 1979-1982), causing deep recession but breaking inflation.

### Section D

**Q12:** Fed conducts monetary policy primarily by setting the federal funds rate (rate banks charge each other overnight).

Transmission mechanism:
1. Fed sets target rate → affects short-term rates immediately
2. Short-term rates → long-term rates (expectations/arbitrage)
3. Long-term rates → cost of capital (mortgages, corporate bonds)
4. Lower cost of capital → more investment, housing demand
5. Also: Lower rates → dollar weakens → exports increase
6. Also: Lower rates → asset prices rise → wealth effect → consumption
7. Full effect: 6-18 months to real economy

**Q13:** Taylor Rule considers:
- Current inflation vs. target (inflation gap)
- Current output vs. potential (output gap)
- Neutral real interest rate

Calculation:
i = r* + π + 0.5(π - π*) + 0.5(output gap)
i = 2% + 4% + 0.5(4% - 2%) + 0.5(-2%)
i = 2% + 4% + 1% - 1%
i = 6%

Taylor Rule suggests 6% rate. The high inflation term dominates, suggesting aggressive tightening even though there's a modest output gap.

**Q14:** Quantitative Easing (QE) is when the central bank buys longer-term securities (usually government bonds, sometimes mortgage-backed securities) to:

When used:
- When short-term rates are at or near zero (zero lower bound)
- Traditional rate cuts exhausted
- Economy still needs stimulus

How it works:
1. Fed creates reserves and buys bonds
2. Bond prices rise, yields fall (long-term rates decline)
3. Investors pushed into riskier assets (portfolio balance effect)
4. Lower long-term rates reduce borrowing costs
5. Higher asset prices create wealth effect
6. Dollar may weaken (capital seeks higher returns elsewhere)

### Section E

**Q15:** Fiscal multiplier: The ratio of change in GDP to change in government spending.

Theory: If multiplier = 2, then $100B spending → $200B GDP increase

Why actual multipliers are lower (typically 0.5-1.5):
1. **Crowding out** - Government borrowing raises interest rates, reducing private investment
2. **Leakages** - Imports, savings, taxes reduce recirculation
3. **Ricardian equivalence** - People save expecting future tax increases
4. **Supply constraints** - If economy at capacity, more inflation than output
5. **Implementation delays** - "Shovel-ready" projects often aren't

**Q16:** Automatic stabilizers are fiscal mechanisms that adjust automatically without new legislation.

Difference from discretionary:
- Automatic: No legislative action needed, immediate response
- Discretionary: Requires legislation, subject to lags

Examples:
1. **Progressive income taxes** - Revenue falls automatically in recession as incomes drop, providing stimulus
2. **Unemployment insurance** - Spending rises automatically as unemployment increases, supporting demand
3. **Food stamps/SNAP** - Enrollment and spending rise in downturns
4. **Corporate taxes** - Fall when profits decline

**Q17:** Analysis:
Interest rate (r) = 5%
Growth rate (g) = 2%
r > g, so debt tends to grow faster than economy

Debt dynamics formula:
ΔDebt/GDP ≈ (r - g) × Debt/GDP + Primary Deficit

ΔDebt/GDP = (5% - 2%) × 90% + 1%
ΔDebt/GDP = 2.7% + 1%
ΔDebt/GDP = 3.7%

The debt/GDP ratio is RISING by approximately 3.7 percentage points per year. To stabilize, the country needs a primary SURPLUS of (r-g) × Debt/GDP = 2.7% of GDP (currently has 1% deficit, so needs 3.7% swing).

### Section F

**Q18:** Three types of currency exposure:

1. **Transaction exposure**: Risk from contractual foreign currency obligations
- Example: Receivable in euros due in 90 days
- Can hedge with forwards, options

2. **Translation exposure**: Risk from consolidating foreign subsidiary financials
- Example: Euro-denominated assets converted to USD for reporting
- Accounting impact, no cash flow effect
- Balance sheet hedging possible

3. **Economic (operating) exposure**: Risk to competitive position from currency moves
- Example: Strong dollar makes US exports less competitive globally
- Affects long-term competitiveness regardless of specific contracts
- MOST DIFFICULT to hedge because:
  - Long-term, uncertain timing
  - Affects revenues and costs differently
  - Competitors may have different exposures
  - Requires strategic response (where to produce, price, source)

**Q19:** Long-run growth drivers (from production function Y = A × F(K, L)):

1. **Capital accumulation (K)** - More machines, buildings, infrastructure
2. **Labor growth (L)** - More workers, more hours
3. **Total Factor Productivity (TFP)** - Technology, efficiency, human capital, institutions

TFP is most important because:
- Capital has diminishing returns (each additional unit adds less)
- Labor growth limited by demographics
- TFP can grow continuously through innovation
- TFP explains most of the difference between rich and poor countries
- Historical evidence: TFP explains 50-70% of growth in developed economies
- Only sustained TFP growth enables sustained per-capita growth

**Q20:** Strategic options when facing 25% tariff on Chinese sourcing:

1. **Absorb the cost** - Margin hit but maintain supply chain
2. **Pass through to customers** - Price increase, volume risk
3. **Partial pass-through** - Share pain with customers
4. **Shift sourcing** - Vietnam, India, Mexico, domestic
5. **Negotiate with suppliers** - Seek cost reductions
6. **Redesign products** - Use different materials/components

Non-cost factors to consider:
- Lead times and reliability
- Quality consistency
- Intellectual property protection
- Political/geopolitical risk
- Supplier relationship value
- Supply chain resilience
- ESG considerations
- Future tariff risk (other countries?)
- Customer preferences (made in USA)
- Complexity of transition
- Strategic competition (are competitors affected similarly?)
