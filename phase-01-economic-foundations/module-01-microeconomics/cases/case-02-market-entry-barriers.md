## Exhibit 2: Barrier to Entry Analysis

### Capital Requirements

| Investment Area | Amount | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| Hardware per station | $50,000-150,000 | DC fast chargers: $100K+ |
| Installation per station | $20,000-50,000 | Varies by site |
| Software platform | $10-20M | App, network management, billing |
| Sales & marketing | $5-10M/year | To compete for locations |
| Working capital | $20-30M | Inventory, operations |
| **Minimum viable entry** | **$75-100M** | For ~500 stations |

### Network Effects

| Network Type | Strength | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| Driver-side | Strong | More stations = more value to drivers |
| Host-side | Moderate | Larger network = more utilization = more attractive to hosts |
| Cross-side | Strong | More drivers → more attractive to hosts; more hosts → more attractive to drivers |

**Current Network Sizes:**
- ChargePoint: 65,000 stations, millions of users
- GreenCharge (potential): 500 stations to start

### Switching Costs

**For Site Hosts:**
- 5-7 year contracts common
- Hardware is location-specific
- Integration with site systems
- Relationship with account manager
- Estimated switching cost: $20,000-50,000 per station

**For Drivers:**
- RFID cards and app accounts
- But: most use multiple networks
- Low individual switching cost
- Aggregator apps reduce friction

### Economies of Scale

| Area | Scale Advantage |
|------|-----------------|
| Hardware procurement | 15-25% cost reduction at volume |
| Software development | Amortize over more stations |
| Customer support | Shared resources |

## Analysis Framework

### Market Structure Analysis

**This is an emerging oligopoly:**
- Few dominant players (4 control 80% share)
- Significant barriers to entry (capital, network effects)
- Differentiated products (network size, technology, brand)
- Mutual interdependence (players watch each other closely)
- Not yet mature—structure still forming

**Implications:**
- Positive profits possible long-term
- But competitive dynamics complex
- New entrant faces uphill battle against network effects
- Early positioning critical before market solidifies

### Porter's Five Forces

| Force | Intensity | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Threat of New Entrants** | Moderate | High capital requirements, but still a growth market attracting investment |
| **Supplier Power** | Low | Multiple hardware manufacturers |
| **Buyer Power** | Moderate | Large commercial hosts have negotiating leverage |
| **Threat of Substitutes** | Low | Limited alternatives to dedicated charging |
| **Competitive Rivalry** | High | Growing but still limited demand, many players competing |

**Overall:** Moderately attractive industry, but profitability requires scale and differentiation.

### Network Effects Deep Dive

**The Critical Challenge:**

ChargePoint's network has 65,000 stations. Each new station makes the network more valuable. A new entrant with 500 stations provides fraction of the value.

**Breaking Network Effects:**
1. **Niche dominance**: Be the best in a specific segment (fleet, region)
2. **Superior technology**: Overcome network disadvantage with better product
3. **Interoperability**: Plug into existing networks (reduces disadvantage)
4. **Subsidy**: Pay to attract early users and hosts

### Game Theory: Entry Response

**If GreenCharge enters with Option A (Broad Network):**

**ChargePoint's Options:**
1. **Accommodate**: Allow entry, maintain pricing
2. **Aggressive response**: Cut prices, lock up key locations
3. **Acquire**: Buy GreenCharge

**Payoff Matrix (simplified, $ in millions NPV):**

|  | ChargePoint: Accommodate | ChargePoint: Aggressive |
|---|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **GreenCharge: Enter** | GC: +$30, CP: +$100 | GC: -$40, CP: +$50 |
| **GreenCharge: Don't Enter** | GC: $0, CP: +$150 | GC: $0, CP: +$150 |

**Analysis:**
- If ChargePoint accommodates, entry is profitable ($30M)
- If ChargePoint is aggressive, entry loses money (-$40M)
- ChargePoint prefers accommodation ($100M vs. $50M), but might fight to deter

**Key Question:** Is ChargePoint's aggressive threat credible?
- They have resources to fight
- But fighting is costly and may not succeed
- Industry is growing—less zero-sum than mature markets
- Likely outcome: Accommodation with moderate competitive response

### Entry Strategy Recommendation

**Recommended: Option B (Fleet Niche) with Path to Option D (Regional)**

**Rationale:**

1. **Avoids direct network competition**
   - Fleet customers care less about broad networks
   - Different buying criteria (TCO, reliability, service)
   - ChargePoint less dominant in this segment

2. **Higher switching costs favor incumbents less**
   - Fleet relationships are B2B with longer sales cycles
   - But once won, very sticky

3. **Better unit economics**
   - Predictable utilization (fleet schedules)
   - Higher average ticket
   - Lower customer acquisition cost

4. **Build credentials for expansion**
   - Success in fleet enables expansion to other segments
   - Use regional density (Option D) within fleet focus

**Implementation:**
- Phase 1 (Year 1-2): Fleet focus, $40M investment
- Phase 2 (Year 2-3): Regional density in 2-3 metros
- Phase 3 (Year 3-5): Selective expansion based on learning

## Teaching Note

### Key Microeconomic Concepts Applied

1. **Market Structure**
   - Oligopoly with emerging competitive dynamics
   - Network effects create barriers

2. **Barriers to Entry**
   - Capital requirements
   - Network effects
   - Economies of scale
   - Switching costs

3. **Game Theory**
   - Entry deterrence games
   - Credibility of competitive threats
   - Sequential game thinking

4. **Niche Strategy**
   - Segment-specific positioning
   - Avoiding direct competition with scale players

5. **Path Dependency**
   - Early positioning matters in network effect markets
   - First-mover advantages can be decisive

### Common Mistakes

- Underestimating network effects
- Assuming incumbents won't respond
- Choosing broad entry without differentiation
- Ignoring game-theoretic dynamics
- Over-optimistic utilization assumptions

### Strong vs. Weak Answers

**Weak Answer:**
"The market is growing 25%, so there's room for everyone. Enter broadly and compete on service."

**Strong Answer:**
"This is an emerging oligopoly with strong network effects favoring incumbents. Direct competition with ChargePoint is economically disadvantaged. Instead, focus on fleet segment where network effects matter less, build regional density, and use this as a platform for selective expansion once we've established differentiation and scale in our niche."
