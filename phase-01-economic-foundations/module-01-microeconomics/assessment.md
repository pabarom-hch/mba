## Answer Key

### Section A

**Q1:** Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative foregone. A CEO allocating capital should compare each investment not just to "doing nothing" but to the best alternative use of that capital. For example, if investing $10M in Project A returns 15%, but Project B would return 20%, the opportunity cost of choosing A is the forgone 20% return from B.

**Q2:** Continue an activity until marginal benefit equals marginal cost (MB = MC). A firm should stop producing when the cost of the next unit (MC) exceeds the revenue from selling it (MR). Producing beyond this point reduces profit.

**Q3:** Movement along = caused by price change (same curve). Shift = caused by non-price factors (new curve). Example movement: Price rises from $50 to $60, quantity demanded falls from 100 to 80. Example shift: Consumer income increases, so at every price level, more is demanded (whole curve shifts right).

**Q4:** When demand is inelastic, price increases raise revenue. A 10% price increase reduces quantity by less than 10% (say 5%). Revenue = P × Q, so the price effect dominates the quantity effect. Net result: higher revenue.

**Q5:** Consumer surplus is the difference between willingness to pay and actual price paid. Firms capture more through: (1) price discrimination (charge different prices to different segments), (2) versioning (good-better-best tiers), (3) bundling (capture diverse WTP), (4) reducing consumer surplus visibility (complex pricing).

**Q6:** Fixed costs don't vary with output (rent, executive salaries, software licenses). Variable costs change with output (cloud computing usage, customer support per user, sales commissions). Software company examples: Fixed = Office rent, engineer salaries. Variable = AWS hosting costs, payment processing fees per transaction.

**Q7:** Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing strategy. In Prisoner's Dilemma: Both confessing is Nash equilibrium because if A confesses, B does better confessing too (and vice versa). Neither wants to switch given what the other is doing, even though both would be better off if both stayed silent.

**Q8:** Adverse selection is when one party has more information before a transaction, leading to market dysfunction. Example: Health insurance—sick people are more likely to buy, so premiums rise, healthy people exit, and the market unravels. Mitigation: require participation (mandates), screen applicants, design products that attract healthy people (wellness benefits), group sales.

### Section B

**Q9:**
a) Arc elasticity from $10 to $12:
- % change Q = (850K - 1M) / 925K = -16.2%
- % change P = ($12 - $10) / $11 = 18.2%
- Ed = -16.2% / 18.2% = -0.89 (inelastic)

b) Arc elasticity from $12 to $15:
- % change Q = (650K - 850K) / 750K = -26.7%
- % change P = ($15 - $12) / $13.50 = 22.2%
- Ed = -26.7% / 22.2% = -1.20 (elastic)

c) Revenue:
- At $10: $10M
- At $12: $10.2M ← Maximum
- At $15: $9.75M

d) Profit = (P - VC) × Q
- At $10: ($10 - $3) × 1M = $7M
- At $12: ($12 - $3) × 0.85M = $7.65M ← Maximum
- At $15: ($15 - $3) × 0.65M = $7.8M

Wait, let me recalculate:
- At $10: $7 × 1M = $7M
- At $12: $9 × 850K = $7.65M
- At $15: $12 × 650K = $7.8M ← Maximum profit

Profit is maximized at $15 because contribution margin is highest there despite lower volume.

**Q10:**
a) Product B is more elastic (|−2.5| > |−0.5|).
b) Increase price on Product A. With inelastic demand, price increases raise revenue. For Product B (elastic), price increases reduce revenue.
c) Possible factors: A has fewer substitutes, A is a necessity, A is a smaller budget share, A has higher brand loyalty, A's market is more narrowly defined.

### Section C

**Q11:**
a) Fixed costs = $100,000 (cost at zero output)

b) Marginal costs:
- 0→1,000: ($150K - $100K) / 1,000 = $50
- 1,000→2,000: ($190K - $150K) / 1,000 = $40
- 2,000→3,000: ($240K - $190K) / 1,000 = $50
- 3,000→4,000: ($310K - $240K) / 1,000 = $70
- 4,000→5,000: ($400K - $310K) / 1,000 = $90

c) ATC at 3,000 = $240,000 / 3,000 = $80/unit

d) At P = $70, produce where MC ≤ $70. MC = $50 at 3,000 units, MC = $70 at 4,000 units. Produce 4,000 units (MR = MC at 4,000). But let's verify profit:
- At 3,000: Revenue $210K, Cost $240K, Loss $30K
- At 4,000: Revenue $280K, Cost $310K, Loss $30K
- Actually, firm is losing money at both levels. Shut down in long run, but in short run, compare to shutting down (losing $100K fixed costs). At 4,000 units, contribution margin = $280K - $210K variable = $70K, which covers some fixed costs. Produce 4,000 units short-term.

**Q12:**
a) Current: FC + VC = ($50 × 100,000) - ($30 × 100,000) = ... Let me recalculate.
If ATC = $50 at 100,000 units, Total Cost = $5M.
If VC = $30, then Variable Cost = $3M, so Fixed Cost = $2M.

b) New factory: FC = $2M + $10M = $12M
Variable cost at 200,000 = $25 × 200,000 = $5M
Total cost = $17M
ATC = $17M / 200,000 = $85/unit

Wait, this is higher than before ($50). Let me re-examine the problem.

Actually, the new factory ATC is $85 vs. old ATC of $50. This investment is NOT worthwhile unless:
- Volume exceeds 200,000 significantly
- The reduced VC continues to scale
- There are capacity constraints at current factory

c) For investment to be worthwhile:
- Must achieve volume where new ATC < old ATC, or
- Must gain revenue opportunities (supply constraints) that current factory can't fulfill, or
- Strategic value (flexibility, quality) justifies higher cost

### Section D

**Q13:**
a) Smartphone OS (iOS, Android): **Duopoly/Oligopoly** - Only two meaningful players, extremely high barriers (network effects, developer ecosystem), significant market power.

b) Local restaurants: **Monopolistic competition** - Many sellers, differentiated products (cuisine, atmosphere), low barriers, some pricing power through differentiation.

c) Soybean farming: **Perfect competition** - Many sellers, homogeneous product, no barriers, price takers.

d) Commercial aircraft: **Duopoly/Oligopoly** - Two dominant players, massive barriers (capital, technology, certification), high interdependence.

**Q14:**
a) **Oligopoly** - Few firms, high interdependence, significant barriers.

b) Reasons for limited price wars:
- Mutual interdependence (price cuts matched immediately, no gain)
- Learned from past wars (destroyed value industry-wide)
- Differentiation (network coverage, brand) reduces direct competition
- Tacit coordination (following pricing patterns)
- High fixed costs (price wars devastate everyone)

c) New entrant prediction:
- Incumbents likely accommodate initially
- If entrant gains traction, possible price response
- Likely outcome: market share reallocation, some price pressure
- If entrant is well-funded, could trigger competition

d) Barriers to entry:
- Spectrum licenses (scarce, expensive)
- Network infrastructure ($billions)
- Brand building
- Economies of scale
- Switching costs (contracts, phone financing)

### Section E

**Q15:**
a) Both "Add" is Nash equilibrium.
- If B adds, A prefers Add ($12M) over Don't Add ($10M)
- If B doesn't add, A prefers Add ($25M) over Don't Add ($20M)
- Add is dominant for A (and by symmetry, for B)

b) Yes, this is a Prisoner's Dilemma:
- (Don't, Don't) = $20M each is better for both
- But (Add, Add) = $12M each is the equilibrium
- Individual rationality leads to collective irrationality

c) Best collective outcome: Both Don't Add ($40M total vs. $24M total)

d) Strategies to achieve better outcome:
- Tacit coordination (follow competitor capacity patterns)
- Signaling (announce long-term capacity plans)
- Building reputation for discipline
- Focus on non-capacity competition (service, routes)
- Capacity reduction agreements (if legal/antitrust allows)

**Q16:**
a) Game tree:
```
Entrant
├── Enter
│   └── Incumbent
│       ├── Fight: (-5, -5)
│       └── Accommodate: (8, 10)
│
└── Stay Out
    └── Incumbent: (0, 30)
```

b) Backward induction:
- If entry occurs, incumbent chooses: Fight (-5) vs. Accommodate (10). Choose Accommodate.
- Knowing incumbent will accommodate, entrant chooses: Enter (8) vs. Stay Out (0). Choose Enter.
- **Equilibrium: (Enter, Accommodate)** with payoffs (8, 10)

c) Threat not credible because once entry occurs, fighting gives -5 vs. accommodating gives +10. Rational incumbent accommodates.

d) Making threat credible:
- Pre-commit to fighting (contractual obligations, public statements)
- Build reputation through past fights
- Make fighting less costly (build war chest, low-cost capacity)
- Structural commitment (capacity that only makes sense if market defended)

### Section F

**Q17:**
a) **Sunk cost fallacy** - Past investment shouldn't affect future decisions. Countermeasure: Ask "Would we start this project today?" Evaluate only future costs and benefits.

b) **Confirmation bias** - Seeking confirming evidence. Countermeasure: Assign devil's advocate role, require explicit analysis of why deal might fail, red team review.

c) **Anchoring/Compromise effect** - Second-cheapest seems like reasonable choice. The second-cheapest wine is often highest margin because of this effect. Customer should compare wine to value independently.

d) **Status quo bias** - Default is not enrolled. Countermeasure: Auto-enrollment with opt-out (reverse the default).

**Q18:** E-commerce checkout redesign:

1. **Progress bar** (Present bias/commitment) - Shows completion status, leverages sunk cost of effort already invested, commits user to finishing.

2. **Social proof** ("23 people bought this today") - Social proof principle - reduces uncertainty by showing others' behavior.

3. **Scarcity indicator** ("Only 3 left!") - Loss aversion - potential loss of opportunity drives urgency.

4. **Default to express checkout** - Status quo bias - make easiest path the purchase path.

5. **"Frequently bought together" with pre-selected add-ons** - Anchoring + defaults - anchor higher total, default includes extras, requires action to remove.
