## Introduction

Consumer theory explains why demand curves slope downward and how consumers make choices. At its core: consumers maximize their satisfaction (utility) subject to their budget constraint.

For business leaders, understanding consumer theory helps you understand what customers really value, how they make trade-offs, and how to capture more of the value you create.

## Core Concepts

### Utility

**Definition:** Utility is the satisfaction or benefit a consumer receives from consuming a good or service.

Utility is subjective—it varies by person and context. It cannot be measured directly, but we can observe choices that reveal preferences.

**Total Utility vs. Marginal Utility:**
- **Total Utility (TU):** Total satisfaction from all units consumed
- **Marginal Utility (MU):** Additional satisfaction from one more unit

### Diminishing Marginal Utility

**Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility:** As you consume more of a good, the additional satisfaction from each unit decreases.

| Units | Total Utility | Marginal Utility |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| 0 | 0 | - |
| 1 | 100 | 100 |
| 2 | 180 | 80 |
| 3 | 240 | 60 |
| 4 | 280 | 40 |
| 5 | 300 | 20 |
| 6 | 305 | 5 |

```
Utility
   │              Total Utility
   │                  ●────●
   │              ●──
   │          ●──

   │ ●
   │   ●
   │     ●
   │       ●──●
   └─────────────────────────── Quantity
         Marginal Utility
```

**Why This Matters for Business:**
- First-time customers get highest value—charge accordingly
- Subscription value declines over time—renewal harder than acquisition
- Bundle products to shift consumption to where MU is still high

### Consumer Surplus

**Definition:** The difference between what a consumer is willing to pay and what they actually pay.

```
Consumer Surplus = Willingness to Pay - Actual Price
```

```
Price
   │
   │\
   │ \    Consumer Surplus
   │  \   (shaded area)
   │   \░░░░░░░
   │    \░░░░░
   │     ●─────── Market Price
   │      \
   │       \  Demand
   └─────────────────── Quantity
```

**Example:**
You're willing to pay $50 for a concert ticket but buy it for $30.
Your consumer surplus = $50 - $30 = $20.

**Business Implication:**
Consumer surplus is value you created but didn't capture. Pricing strategies aim to capture more of this surplus.

### Budget Constraints

Consumers can't buy unlimited quantities—they face budget limits.

**Budget Constraint:**
```
Income = (Price of X × Quantity of X) + (Price of Y × Quantity of Y)
I = PxQx + PyQy
```

```
Good Y
   │
   │\  Budget Line
   │ \
   │  \
   │   \  Feasible
   │    \ Consumption
   │     \ Set
   │      \
   │       \
   └────────────── Good X
```

**The budget line shows all combinations of X and Y that exactly spend the budget.**

### Consumer Optimization

Consumers maximize utility subject to their budget constraint.

**The Optimization Rule:**
```
MUx/Px = MUy/Py = MUz/Pz = ... (for all goods)
```

**Translation:** The marginal utility per dollar should be equal across all goods.

**Intuition:** If MU per dollar is higher for good X than good Y, you should buy more X and less Y until they equalize.

**Example:**

| Good | MU | Price | MU per Dollar |
|------|----|-------|---------------|
| Coffee | 30 | $5 | 6 |
| Tea | 20 | $2 | 10 |
| Soda | 10 | $2 | 5 |

Current allocation is suboptimal. You should shift spending from coffee and soda to tea (higher MU per dollar) until marginal utilities adjust.

### Preferences and Indifference Curves

**Indifference Curve:** Shows all combinations of goods that provide equal utility.

```
Good Y
   │
   │   IC₃ (higher utility)
   │    ╲
   │     ╲  IC₂
   │      ╲ ╲
   │       ╲ ╲  IC₁ (lower utility)
   │        ╲ ╲
   │         ╲ ╲
   └──────────────── Good X
```

**Properties:**
1. Higher curves = higher utility
2. Curves don't cross
3. Curves slope downward (trade-offs)
4. Curves are convex (diminishing MRS)

**Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS):** How much Y you'd give up for one more X while staying equally satisfied.

### Consumer Choice

Optimal choice is where the budget line is tangent to the highest attainable indifference curve.

```
Good Y
   │
   │╲   Budget Line
   │ ╲
   │  ╲    ╱─── IC₂ (not affordable)
   │   ●──╱
   │  ╱ ╲
   │ ╱   ╲  IC₁ (optimal)
   │╱     ╲
   └──────────────── Good X
         ●
    Optimal Choice
```

**At the optimum:**
```
MRS = Px/Py
```

The rate at which you're willing to trade equals the rate at which the market allows you to trade.

## Consulting Application

### Value-Based Pricing

Consumer surplus reveals untapped value:

**Traditional Cost-Plus Pricing:**
- Cost: $50
- Markup: 40%
- Price: $70

**Value-Based Pricing:**
- Customer willingness to pay: $150
- Price: $120
- You capture $50 more
- Customer still gets $30 surplus

**Consulting Question:** "What is the customer's true willingness to pay? How do we capture more of the value we create?"

### Customer Segmentation

Different segments have different utility functions:

| Segment | Primary Value Driver | Secondary Driver |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Enterprise | Reliability, support | Features |
| Mid-market | Features | Price |
| SMB | Price | Ease of use |

**Implication:** Customize offerings and pricing for each segment based on their utility function.

### Feature Prioritization

Use marginal utility thinking for product decisions:

**Question:** Which feature should we build next?

**Framework:**
```
Feature Value = Additional WTP × Customers Affected
Feature Cost = Development + Ongoing Costs

Build features with highest (Feature Value - Feature Cost)
```

But remember diminishing returns—the 10th feature adds less value than the 5th.

## CEO Application

### Understanding Customer Value

**Key Questions:**
1. What do customers actually value?
2. How much are they willing to pay for each attribute?
3. Where are we leaving consumer surplus on the table?

**Methods:**
- Conjoint analysis (survey-based)
- A/B pricing tests
- Win/loss analysis
- Customer interviews

### Pricing Strategies

**Capture Consumer Surplus Through:**

**1. Versioning (Good-Better-Best)**
```
Basic:    $10 - Low features, captures price-sensitive
Standard: $25 - Core features, captures mainstream
Premium:  $50 - All features, captures high WTP
```

**2. Bundling**
Bundle products to capture surplus from different preferences.

Customer A values Product 1 at $80, Product 2 at $30
Customer B values Product 1 at $40, Product 2 at $60

Sell separately at $40 each: Revenue = $40 + $40 = $80 per customer
Bundle at $90: Both customers buy the bundle. Revenue = $90 per customer.

**3. Two-Part Pricing**
Membership fee + per-use charge (Costco, Amazon Prime)
Captures surplus from heavy users without excluding light users.

### Trade-Off Analysis

Use MRS thinking for strategic decisions:

**What trade-offs are customers willing to make?**
- Price vs. Features
- Quality vs. Speed
- Customization vs. Simplicity

**Example:**
If customers have high MRS between price and features (willing to sacrifice features for lower price), a stripped-down cheap version may capture underserved segment.

## Worked Example

### Situation
A SaaS company offers one product tier at $100/month. Customer research reveals:

| Segment | Size | Current WTP | Using Product? |
|---------|------|-------------|----------------|
| Power Users | 1,000 | $200 | Yes (surplus = $100) |
| Standard Users | 3,000 | $100 | Yes (surplus = $0) |
| Light Users | 5,000 | $50 | No (priced out) |

**Current State:**
- Customers: 4,000 (Power + Standard)
- Revenue: 4,000 × $100 = $400,000/month
- Consumer surplus: 1,000 × $100 = $100,000/month (captured by Power Users)
- Lost opportunity: 5,000 Light Users not served

### Analysis: Three-Tier Strategy

**Proposed Tiers:**
- Light: $50/month (limited features)
- Standard: $100/month (current features)
- Premium: $175/month (additional features)

**Expected Migration:**

| Segment | Tier Choice | Price | Consumer Surplus |
|---------|-------------|-------|------------------|
| Power Users | Premium | $175 | $25 |
| Standard Users | Standard | $100 | $0 |
| Light Users | Light | $50 | $0 |

**New Revenue:**
- Power: 1,000 × $175 = $175,000
- Standard: 3,000 × $100 = $300,000
- Light: 5,000 × $50 = $250,000
- **Total: $725,000/month**

**Improvement: +$325,000/month (+81%)**

Consumer surplus captured from Power Users: $75,000/month
New customers captured: 5,000 Light Users

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Assuming Uniform Willingness to Pay
**Mistake:** "Our customers value this at $100."
**Reality:** WTP varies dramatically by segment. One price leaves money on the table.

### 2. Ignoring Consumer Surplus
**Mistake:** "We're selling everything we make—pricing must be right."
**Reality:** If demand equals supply at your price, you might be underpriced.

### 3. Feature Creep
**Mistake:** "More features = more value."
**Reality:** Diminishing marginal utility means additional features add decreasing value. Complexity can reduce value.

### 4. Cost-Based Pricing
**Mistake:** "It costs us $50, so we price at $75."
**Reality:** Price should be based on customer value, not your costs.

### 5. Ignoring Substitutes
**Mistake:** "Customers will pay $200 for our solution."
**Reality:** WTP depends on available alternatives. Substitutes cap your pricing power.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Utility is subjective** - Value differs by customer and context
2. **Marginal utility diminishes** - Additional units provide decreasing satisfaction
3. **Consumer surplus is value you created but didn't capture** - Pricing opportunity
4. **Consumers optimize MU per dollar** - Best value for money guides choices
5. **Segment by willingness to pay** - Different prices for different valuations
6. **Bundle strategically** - Capture surplus from diverse preferences
7. **Value-based pricing beats cost-plus** - Price on customer value, not your costs

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Consumer Surplus
A customer is willing to pay $80 for a product. The market price is $50. What is the consumer surplus? If you could perfectly price discriminate, what would you charge this customer?

### Problem 2: Optimal Bundle
You have two customer types:

| Type | Value of Product A | Value of Product B |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Type 1 (500 customers) | $100 | $20 |
| Type 2 (500 customers) | $40 | $70 |

What's the optimal pricing strategy: sell separately or bundle? At what price(s)?

### Problem 3: Versioning
You're launching a software product. Customers fall into three segments with these WTP:

| Feature Set | High-End (1,000) | Mid (3,000) | Budget (5,000) |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Basic | $50 | $40 | $30 |
| Standard | $100 | $80 | $45 |
| Premium | $200 | $100 | $55 |

Design a versioning strategy to maximize revenue. What features go in each tier and at what price?
