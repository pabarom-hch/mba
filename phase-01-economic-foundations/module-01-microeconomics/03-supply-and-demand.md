## Introduction

Supply and demand is the most fundamental model in economics. It explains how prices are determined in markets, why prices change, and how markets allocate resources.

For CEOs, supply-demand thinking is essential for understanding your market, predicting competitor behavior, and making pricing decisions.

## Core Concepts

### The Demand Curve

**Law of Demand:** As price increases, quantity demanded decreases (holding other factors constant).

```
Price
  │
  │\
  │ \
  │  \
  │   \
  │    \
  │     \  Demand
  │      \
  │       \
  └─────────────── Quantity
```

**Why does demand slope downward?**
1. **Substitution effect:** Higher prices make alternatives more attractive
2. **Income effect:** Higher prices reduce purchasing power
3. **Diminishing marginal utility:** Additional units are worth less

**Demand Schedule:**

| Price | Quantity Demanded |
|-------|-------------------|
| $100 | 1,000 |
| $80 | 2,000 |
| $60 | 3,500 |
| $40 | 5,500 |
| $20 | 8,000 |

### The Supply Curve

**Law of Supply:** As price increases, quantity supplied increases (holding other factors constant).

```
Price
  │         Supply
  │           ╱
  │          ╱
  │         ╱
  │        ╱
  │       ╱
  │      ╱
  │     ╱
  │    ╱
  └─────────────── Quantity
```

**Why does supply slope upward?**
1. **Higher prices attract more producers**
2. **Existing producers can justify higher marginal costs**
3. **Resources shift from other uses when returns are higher**

### Market Equilibrium

**Equilibrium:** The point where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded.

```
Price
  │
  │\            ╱ Supply
  │ \          ╱
  │  \        ╱
  │   \──────●──── Equilibrium
  │    \    ╱
  │     \  ╱
  │      ╱ \
  │     ╱   \
  │    ╱     \ Demand
  └─────────────────────── Quantity
       Qe
```

At equilibrium:
- No shortage (buyers can buy what they want)
- No surplus (sellers can sell what they produce)
- No pressure for price to change

**Above equilibrium (price too high):**
- Quantity supplied > Quantity demanded
- Surplus/excess supply
- Pressure for price to fall

**Below equilibrium (price too low):**
- Quantity demanded > Quantity supplied
- Shortage/excess demand
- Pressure for price to rise

### Shifts vs. Movements

**Critical Distinction:**

**Movement ALONG the curve:** Caused by price change
- Price changes → quantity changes
- The curve itself doesn't move

**SHIFT of the curve:** Caused by non-price factors
- Entire curve moves left or right
- At every price, quantity is now different

```
MOVEMENT (Price change)          SHIFT (Non-price factor)

Price                            Price
  │                                │
  │ ●                              │\   \
  │  \                             │ \   \
  │   ● ← Movement                 │  \   \  ← Shift right
  │    \  along curve              │   \   \   (increase in demand)
  │     \                          │    \   \
  └──────────── Quantity           └──────────── Quantity
```

### Demand Shifters

Factors that shift the entire demand curve:

| Factor | Shift Direction | Example |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Income (normal good) | ↑ Income → Demand shifts right | Luxury goods |
| Income (inferior good) | ↑ Income → Demand shifts left | Ramen noodles |
| Price of substitutes | ↑ Substitute price → Demand shifts right | Coke if Pepsi price rises |
| Price of complements | ↑ Complement price → Demand shifts left | Gas if car prices rise |
| Tastes/preferences | Favorable change → Demand shifts right | Trend/fad |
| Population | ↑ Population → Demand shifts right | Market growth |
| Expectations | Expected future shortage → Demand shifts right | Hoarding |

### Supply Shifters

Factors that shift the entire supply curve:

| Factor | Shift Direction | Example |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Input prices | ↑ Input costs → Supply shifts left | Oil price spike |
| Technology | Better tech → Supply shifts right | Automation |
| Number of sellers | More sellers → Supply shifts right | New entrants |
| Expectations | Expected higher prices → Supply shifts left (short-term) | Withholding |
| Government policy | Subsidies → Supply shifts right; Taxes → Supply shifts left | Agricultural subsidies |
| Natural conditions | Good weather → Supply shifts right | Agricultural products |

### Predicting Market Outcomes

**Framework for Analysis:**
1. Identify the shock (what changed?)
2. Determine if it affects supply, demand, or both
3. Determine the direction of shift
4. Trace through to new equilibrium
5. Identify price and quantity changes

**Example - New Competitor Enters:**
1. Shock: New competitor enters market
2. Affects: Supply (more sellers)
3. Direction: Supply shifts right
4. New equilibrium: Lower price, higher quantity
5. Outcome: Prices fall, total market quantity increases

```

  │\         S₁    S₂

  │  \      ╱     ╱
  │   ●────╱─────╱
  │   E₁\ ╱     ╱
  │      ●─────╱

  │        \ ╱
  │         ╲
  │          \ D
  └─────────────────── Quantity
      Q₁  Q₂

Price falls from E₁ to E₂
Quantity rises from Q₁ to Q₂
```

## Consulting Application

### Market Sizing with Supply/Demand

Understanding supply and demand helps with:

**Market Sizing:**
- Demand analysis: How many customers want this? At what price points?
- Supply analysis: How much can the industry produce? At what cost?
- Equilibrium: What's the realistic market size given supply constraints?

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Where is the market equilibrium?
- Are we above or below?
- What happens if we change price?

**Competitive Dynamics:**
- How will new entrants affect supply?
- How will substitute products affect demand?
- What's the new equilibrium?

### Due Diligence Applications

**Market Assessment Questions:**
1. Is demand growing or shrinking? (Demand curve shifting?)
2. Is supply expanding? (New entrants, capacity additions?)
3. What's happening to prices? (Equilibrium moving?)
4. Are there supply constraints? (Barriers to supply increase?)

**Example Analysis:**
"The market appears attractive but is reaching equilibrium. Demand has grown 10% annually, but supply has grown 15% as three new players entered. This explains the 8% price decline. Going forward, we expect price pressure to continue unless demand accelerates."

## CEO Application

### Understanding Your Market

**Demand-Side Questions:**
- What drives demand for our product?
- How price-sensitive are customers?
- What substitutes compete for demand?
- What could shift demand in our favor?

**Supply-Side Questions:**
- Who supplies this market?
- What's the cost structure?
- Are there barriers to new supply?
- What could shift supply against us?

### Anticipating Market Changes

**Scenario Planning:**

| Scenario | Supply/Demand Impact | Outcome |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| Recession | Demand shifts left | Lower prices, lower volume |
| New technology | Supply shifts right | Lower prices, higher volume |
| Regulatory change | Supply shifts left | Higher prices, lower volume |
| Competitor exit | Supply shifts left | Higher prices for remaining |
| Substitute emerges | Demand shifts left | Lower prices, lower volume |

### Pricing Decisions

**If you're above market equilibrium:**
- You'll have excess inventory
- Pressure to reduce prices
- May need to differentiate to justify premium

**If you're below market equilibrium:**
- You'll have excess demand
- Opportunity to raise prices
- May be leaving money on the table

## Worked Example

### Situation
A coffee roaster is analyzing the specialty coffee market after news that a drought has damaged crops in Brazil (a major producer).

### Analysis

**Step 1: Identify the Shock**
Drought in Brazil reduces coffee production.

**Step 2: Supply or Demand?**
This affects supply (less coffee available), not demand.

**Step 3: Direction of Shift**
Supply shifts left (less quantity available at every price).

**Step 4: New Equilibrium**
```
Price
  │
  │         S₂   S₁
  │          │    │
  │          │   ╱
  │    E₂────●──╱
  │          │ ╱
  │    E₁────│●
  │          ╱│
  │         ╱ │
  │        ╱  │
  │           ╲ D
  └────────────────── Quantity
           Q₂ Q₁
```

**Step 5: Price and Quantity Changes**
- Price: Increases (from E₁ to E₂)
- Quantity: Decreases (from Q₁ to Q₂)

**Strategic Implications:**
1. **Costs will rise** - Need to either absorb or pass through
2. **Competitors face same pressure** - May enable industry-wide price increase
3. **Shortage possible** - Need to secure supply early
4. **Substitutes become attractive** - Customers may shift to tea or other beverages
5. **Lock in contracts** - Long-term supply agreements become valuable

**Recommendation:** Secure 6-month inventory now before prices rise further. Prepare customers for modest price increase. Explore alternative origins (Colombia, Ethiopia) for diversification.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Confusing Shifts and Movements
**Mistake:** "Higher prices increased demand."
**Reality:** Higher prices caused movement along demand curve (less demanded). Something else shifted demand.

### 2. Ignoring Supply Side
**Mistake:** "Demand is huge—this market is great!"
**Reality:** If supply is unlimited, high demand doesn't guarantee profits.

### 3. Assuming Immediate Equilibrium
**Mistake:** "The market will adjust instantly."
**Reality:** Markets can stay in disequilibrium for extended periods due to stickiness, contracts, and adjustment costs.

### 4. Ignoring Price Controls
**Mistake:** "Supply and demand will determine the price."
**Reality:** Regulations, contracts, and market power can prevent equilibrium.

### 5. Static Thinking
**Mistake:** "We've found the equilibrium."
**Reality:** Both supply and demand curves shift constantly. Equilibrium is a moving target.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Demand slopes down** - Higher prices mean less quantity demanded
2. **Supply slopes up** - Higher prices mean more quantity supplied
3. **Equilibrium clears the market** - Where supply equals demand
4. **Shifts vs. movements** - Price changes cause movements; other factors cause shifts
5. **Trace through the logic** - Identify shock → determine shift → find new equilibrium
6. **Both sides matter** - Don't just analyze demand; supply dynamics are equally important
7. **Markets move** - Equilibrium is dynamic, not static

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Identifying Shifts
For each scenario, identify whether it affects supply, demand, or both, and in which direction:

a) A new study shows coffee improves heart health
b) Coffee farming technology improves yields
c) A recession reduces consumer spending
d) The price of tea (a substitute) doubles

### Problem 2: Market Analysis
The electric vehicle market has seen:
- 30% annual demand growth
- 50% annual supply growth (new factories, new entrants)
- 10% annual price decline

Explain this pattern using supply and demand analysis. What do you predict for the next 3 years?

### Problem 3: Strategic Response
Your company sells industrial chemicals. A new environmental regulation will increase production costs by 20% for all producers in your industry. Using supply and demand, predict the market outcome. How should you respond?
