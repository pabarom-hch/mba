## Introduction

Economics is the study of how to allocate scarce resources. The fundamental insight: **every choice has a cost, and that cost is what you give up**.

This isn't about accounting costs or cash outlays. It's about the value of the next-best alternative—what economists call **opportunity cost**.

Understanding opportunity cost transforms how you make decisions. It forces you to consider not just "Is this good?" but "Is this better than the alternatives?"

---

## Core Concepts

### What Is Opportunity Cost?

**Definition:** The opportunity cost of any choice is the value of the best alternative foregone.

```
Opportunity Cost = Value of Next-Best Alternative
```

**Key insight:** The true cost of something is not what you pay for it—it's what you give up to get it.

**Example - College Education:**
- Explicit costs: $200,000 (tuition, books, fees)
- Opportunity cost: $150,000 (4 years of salary you could have earned)
- True cost: $350,000

Most people only consider explicit costs. Economists consider opportunity costs.

### Why Opportunity Cost Matters

**Every resource is scarce:**
- Time: You can only spend each hour once
- Money: Every dollar has alternative uses
- Attention: You can only focus on so many things
- Talent: Your best people can only work on one project

**Without opportunity cost thinking, you make poor decisions:**
- "This project has positive ROI" (But is it the highest ROI available?)
- "This hire would be great" (But better than other candidates?)
- "We should enter this market" (But what are we not doing instead?)

### Explicit vs. Implicit Costs

**Explicit Costs:** Out-of-pocket payments
- Wages paid to employees
- Rent paid for facilities
- Materials purchased

**Implicit Costs:** Opportunity costs of using resources you own
- The salary you could earn elsewhere (owner's time)
- The rent you could charge for property you own
- The return you could earn on invested capital

**Economic Profit = Revenue - Explicit Costs - Implicit Costs**

A business earning accounting profit may have zero or negative economic profit once you account for implicit costs.

**Example:**
```
Restaurant Owner Analysis

Revenue:                    $500,000
Explicit Costs:
  - Ingredients            -$150,000
  - Staff wages            -$180,000
  - Rent                    -$60,000
  - Utilities/other         -$30,000
                           ---------
Accounting Profit:           $80,000

Implicit Costs:
  - Owner's time             -$90,000  (could earn elsewhere)
  - Return on $200K invested -$20,000  (8% opportunity cost)
                           ---------
Economic Profit:            -$30,000
```

This restaurant is profitable by accounting standards but is destroying value economically. The owner would be better off working elsewhere and investing the capital.

### Sunk Costs vs. Opportunity Costs

**Sunk Costs:** Costs already incurred that cannot be recovered.

**Critical Rule: Sunk costs should NOT affect decisions.**

| Sunk Cost | Opportunity Cost |
|-----------|------------------|
| Already spent | Future choice |
| Cannot be recovered | Can be avoided |
| Irrelevant to decisions | Essential to decisions |

**The Sunk Cost Fallacy:**
"We've already invested $10M in this project, so we should continue."

This is wrong. The $10M is gone regardless. The only question is: "Going forward, is the additional investment worth it compared to alternatives?"

**Example - Movie Ticket:**
You paid $15 for a movie ticket. 30 minutes in, the movie is terrible.
- Sunk cost: $15 (gone regardless of whether you stay)
- Opportunity cost of staying: 90 more minutes of your time
- Correct decision: Leave if you have better uses of your time

The $15 should not factor into your decision at all.

### Opportunity Cost in Time

Time is your scarcest resource as a CEO. Every hour has opportunity cost.

**CEO Time Audit:**

| Activity | Hours/Week | Opportunity Cost |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| Email | 10 | Could be delegated; high-value thinking time lost |
| Internal meetings | 15 | Some necessary, many could be shorter or skipped |
| External meetings | 8 | High-value relationship building |
| Strategic thinking | 3 | Should be higher; crowded out by reactive work |
| Travel | 6 | Could be virtual in some cases |

**Question to ask constantly:** "Is this the highest-value use of my time right now?"

### The Opportunity Cost of Capital

Money invested in one place can't be invested elsewhere. This is why finance uses **hurdle rates** and **cost of capital**.

**Hurdle Rate:** The minimum return a project must achieve to be worth pursuing.

If your company's cost of capital is 12%, a project returning 8% is value-destroying—even though it's profitable in isolation.

```
Project A: Returns 15%
Project B: Returns 10%
Cost of Capital: 12%

Project A: Creates value (+3% above hurdle)
Project B: Destroys value (-2% below hurdle)
```

**Implication:** Don't ask "Does this project make money?" Ask "Does this project beat our opportunity cost of capital?"

## Consulting Application

### Opportunity Cost in Client Recommendations

Consultants constantly evaluate opportunity costs:

**Resource Allocation:**
"Should the client invest in Market A or Market B?"
→ The opportunity cost of choosing A is the forgone value from B.

**Build vs. Buy:**
"Should the client build this capability internally or acquire it?"
→ Internal build has opportunity cost of time-to-market.
→ Acquisition has opportunity cost of capital deployed.

**Prioritization:**
"Which initiatives should the client pursue?"
→ Rank by value, but remember: pursuing #3 means not pursuing #4-10.

### The "Compared to What?" Question

McKinsey consultants are trained to always ask: "Compared to what?"

Every recommendation is only as good as the alternatives considered.

**Weak Analysis:** "This strategy will increase profits by $10M."

**Strong Analysis:** "This strategy will increase profits by $10M. Alternative A would increase profits by $7M. Alternative B would increase profits by $12M but requires capabilities we don't have. Given our constraints, this strategy offers the best risk-adjusted return."

## CEO Application

### Capital Allocation

The CEO's primary job is capital allocation—deciding where to invest money, time, and talent.

**Every investment decision is an opportunity cost decision:**
- Invest in Product A → Can't invest in Product B
- Acquire Company X → Can't acquire Company Y
- Hire executive Z → Can't hire alternative candidates

**Framework for Capital Allocation:**

1. List all potential uses of capital
2. Estimate return on each
3. Rank by risk-adjusted return
4. Invest from top down until capital is exhausted
5. Everything below the cutoff is the opportunity cost of the things above

### The "Hell Yes or No" Principle

Derek Sivers' principle applies opportunity cost thinking to decisions:

"If you're not saying 'Hell yes!' to something, say no."

**Why this works:** Your time is finite. Every mediocre commitment crowds out potentially great ones. The opportunity cost of "yes" is all the things you can't say yes to later.

### Hiring Decisions

Hiring is one of the highest-opportunity-cost decisions:

**Obvious cost:** Salary + benefits
**Hidden opportunity costs:**
- Manager time spent recruiting, interviewing, onboarding
- The candidates you passed on to hire this person
- The salary budget that can't be used for other roles
- The organizational attention this hire will consume

**Implication:** Raise the bar. A mediocre hire has enormous opportunity cost.

### Kill Decisions

One of the hardest CEO tasks is killing projects. Sunk cost fallacy makes this emotionally difficult.

**Reframe:** "Every dollar we spend continuing this project is a dollar we can't spend on better opportunities."

**Questions to ask:**
1. Knowing what we know now, would we start this project today?
2. If we killed this, what could we do with the resources instead?
3. What's the opportunity cost of the executive attention this project consumes?

## Worked Example

### Situation
TechCo is deciding whether to build a new product feature in-house or acquire a startup that has already built it.

**Option A: Build In-House**
- Cost: $5M over 18 months
- Engineering team: 15 engineers for 18 months
- Time to market: 18 months

**Option B: Acquire Startup**
- Cost: $20M acquisition price
- Integration: 6 months
- Time to market: 6 months

### Analysis

**Explicit Cost Comparison:**
- Build: $5M
- Buy: $20M
- Simple conclusion: Build is cheaper

**Opportunity Cost Analysis:**

*Engineering Time:*
- 15 engineers × 18 months = 270 engineer-months
- Alternative value of this time: Could build Feature Y (estimated value: $15M in additional revenue)
- Opportunity cost of building: $15M

*Time to Market:*
- 12-month delay vs. acquisition
- Market growing 20% annually
- Competitor may capture share during delay
- Estimated cost of delay: $8M in foregone revenue and market position

*Capital Opportunity Cost:*
- $20M deployed in acquisition
- Alternative: Could invest in Market Z expansion
- Expected return on Market Z: 25% = $5M
- Opportunity cost of acquisition: $5M

**Full Analysis:**

| Factor | Build | Buy |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Explicit cost | $5M | $20M |
| Engineering opportunity cost | $15M | $0 |
| Time-to-market cost | $8M | $0 |
| Capital opportunity cost | $0 | $5M |
| **Total Economic Cost** | **$28M** | **$25M** |

**Conclusion:** Despite higher explicit cost, acquisition is the better economic decision once opportunity costs are considered.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring Implicit Costs
**Mistake:** "The office space is free—we own it."
**Reality:** You could rent it out. The opportunity cost is the rent you forgo.

### 2. Sunk Cost Fallacy
**Mistake:** "We've already spent $5M, so we should continue."
**Reality:** The $5M is gone. Only future costs and benefits matter.

### 3. Ignoring Time Costs
**Mistake:** "This project only costs $1M."
**Reality:** What about the 6 months of leadership attention it will consume?

### 4. Narrow Framing
**Mistake:** "This investment returns 10%—we should do it."
**Reality:** Compared to what? If your hurdle rate is 15%, you're destroying value.

### 5. Ignoring Optionality
**Mistake:** "We need to decide now."
**Reality:** Waiting has value if it allows you to gather information. But waiting also has opportunity cost.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Opportunity cost is the true cost** - What you give up, not what you pay
2. **Sunk costs are irrelevant** - Don't throw good money after bad
3. **Time has opportunity cost** - Your scarcest resource
4. **Capital has opportunity cost** - Hurdle rates exist for a reason
5. **Always ask "Compared to what?"** - Every choice has alternatives
6. **Implicit costs are real** - Even if accounting doesn't count them
7. **Best decisions consider all opportunity costs** - Explicit, implicit, and time

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Sunk Cost Recognition
Your company invested $3M developing a product that has failed in testing. The product can be salvaged with an additional $1M investment, which would generate $2M in revenue. Should you invest the additional $1M?

### Problem 2: Time Opportunity Cost
You're a CEO earning $500K/year. You spend 10 hours per week on tasks that could be done by a $100K/year executive assistant. Should you hire the assistant?

### Problem 3: Capital Allocation
You have $10M to invest. You have three options:
- Project A: Returns $12M with certainty
- Project B: Returns $15M with 80% probability, $5M with 20% probability
- Project C: Returns $20M with 50% probability, $0 with 50% probability

What's the opportunity cost of choosing Project A? Which would you choose and why?
