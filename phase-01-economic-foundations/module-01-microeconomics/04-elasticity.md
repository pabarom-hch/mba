## Introduction

Supply and demand tell you the direction of changes. Elasticity tells you the magnitude.

Elasticity measures how responsive quantity is to price changes. This is critical for pricing decisions: Will raising prices increase or decrease revenue? The answer depends on elasticity.

## Core Concepts

### Price Elasticity of Demand

**Definition:** The percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.

```
Price Elasticity of Demand (Ed) = % Change in Quantity Demanded
                                  ────────────────────────────
                                     % Change in Price

Ed = (ΔQ/Q) / (ΔP/P)
```

**Note:** Elasticity is typically negative (price up → quantity down), but we often discuss the absolute value.

### Interpreting Elasticity Values

| |Ed| | Classification | Meaning |
|------|----------------|---------|
| |Ed| > 1 | Elastic | Quantity changes more than proportionally to price |
| |Ed| = 1 | Unit Elastic | Quantity changes proportionally to price |
| |Ed| < 1 | Inelastic | Quantity changes less than proportionally to price |
| |Ed| = 0 | Perfectly Inelastic | Quantity doesn't respond to price |
| |Ed| = ∞ | Perfectly Elastic | Any price increase loses all demand |

**Examples:**

| Product | Elasticity | Explanation |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Insulin | ~0.2 (very inelastic) | No substitutes, life-critical |
| Salt | ~0.1 (very inelastic) | Cheap, no substitutes |
| Restaurant meals | ~2.3 (elastic) | Many substitutes, discretionary |
| Air travel (vacation) | ~1.5 (elastic) | Discretionary, substitutes exist |
| Air travel (business) | ~0.3 (inelastic) | Time-critical, few alternatives |
| Gasoline (short-run) | ~0.3 (inelastic) | Need for commuting, limited alternatives |
| Gasoline (long-run) | ~0.7 (more elastic) | Can buy fuel-efficient car, move closer |

### Elasticity and Revenue

**This is the critical business insight:**

| Elasticity | If Price Increases | Effect on Revenue |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Elastic (|Ed| > 1) | Q falls more than P rises | Revenue DECREASES |
| Unit Elastic (|Ed| = 1) | Q falls same % as P rises | Revenue UNCHANGED |
| Inelastic (|Ed| < 1) | Q falls less than P rises | Revenue INCREASES |

**The Rule:**
- **Inelastic demand: Raise prices to increase revenue**
- **Elastic demand: Lower prices to increase revenue**

```
Revenue = Price × Quantity

If demand is inelastic:
  ↑ Price 10% → ↓ Quantity 5%
  Net effect: Revenue ↑ 5%

If demand is elastic:
  ↑ Price 10% → ↓ Quantity 20%
  Net effect: Revenue ↓ 10%
```

### Determinants of Elasticity

**What makes demand more elastic?**

| Factor | More Elastic When... | Example |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| **Substitutes** | Many close substitutes available | Coke vs. Pepsi |
| **Necessity vs. Luxury** | Product is a luxury | Jewelry |
| **Budget Share** | Large portion of budget | Housing |
| **Time Horizon** | Longer time to adjust | Long-run gasoline demand |
| **Definition** | Narrowly defined market | "Honda Civic" vs. "cars" |
| **Brand Loyalty** | Low loyalty | Generic products |

### Calculating Elasticity

**Point Elasticity:** At a specific point on the curve

```
Ed = (dQ/dP) × (P/Q)
```

**Arc Elasticity:** Between two points (more practical)

```
Ed = [(Q₂ - Q₁) / ((Q₁ + Q₂)/2)] ÷ [(P₂ - P₁) / ((P₁ + P₂)/2)]
```

**Example Calculation:**

Price drops from $10 to $8. Quantity increases from 100 to 150.

```
% Change in Quantity = (150 - 100) / ((100 + 150)/2) = 50/125 = 40%
% Change in Price = (8 - 10) / ((10 + 8)/2) = -2/9 = -22%

Ed = 40% / -22% = -1.8

|Ed| = 1.8 (elastic)
```

**Interpretation:** For every 1% price decrease, quantity demanded increases by 1.8%.

### Other Types of Elasticity

#### Income Elasticity of Demand

How quantity demanded responds to income changes.

```
Income Elasticity (Ey) = % Change in Quantity / % Change in Income
```

| Ey Value | Classification | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| Ey > 1 | Luxury good | Fine dining, premium brands |
| 0 < Ey < 1 | Normal/necessity | Groceries, basic clothing |
| Ey < 0 | Inferior good | Ramen, bus travel |

**Business Implication:**
- In a recession (income falls), demand for luxuries drops more than necessities
- Inferior goods actually see demand increase in recessions

#### Cross-Price Elasticity

How quantity demanded of one good responds to price changes in another.

```
Cross-Price Elasticity (Exy) = % Change in Quantity of X / % Change in Price of Y
```

| Exy Value | Relationship | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Exy > 0 | Substitutes | Coke and Pepsi |
| Exy < 0 | Complements | Printers and ink |
| Exy = 0 | Unrelated | Coffee and cars |

**Business Implication:**
- If a competitor raises prices, your demand increases (substitutes)
- If complement prices rise, your demand falls (bundles)

#### Price Elasticity of Supply

How quantity supplied responds to price changes.

```
Es = % Change in Quantity Supplied / % Change in Price
```

Supply is more elastic when:
- Producers can easily adjust production
- Inputs are readily available
- Time horizon is longer

## Consulting Application

### Pricing Optimization

**The Fundamental Question:** Is our demand elastic or inelastic?

**If Elastic (|Ed| > 1):**
- Lower prices to capture volume
- Focus on market share
- Compete on value

**If Inelastic (|Ed| < 1):**
- Raise prices to capture margin
- Focus on differentiation
- Compete on premium positioning

**Case Example:**

Client's current: Price = $100, Quantity = 1,000, Revenue = $100,000

Research shows |Ed| = 0.5 (inelastic)

**Scenario: Raise price 10%**
- New price: $110
- Expected quantity decline: 5% (because Ed = 0.5)
- New quantity: 950
- New revenue: $104,500

**Recommendation:** Raise prices. Revenue increases despite volume decline.

### Segmentation by Elasticity

Different customer segments often have different elasticities:

| Segment | Elasticity | Pricing Strategy |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| Enterprise customers | Low (inelastic) | Premium pricing, value selling |
| SMB customers | Medium | Competitive pricing |
| Consumer/prosumer | High (elastic) | Volume pricing, promotions |

**Strategy:** Price discriminate—charge more to segments with lower elasticity.

### Competitive Analysis

Use cross-price elasticity to understand competitive dynamics:

**High positive Exy:** Direct competitors—their price moves affect you significantly
**Low positive Exy:** Indirect competitors—weaker connection
**Negative Exy:** Complements—partner opportunities

## CEO Application

### Strategic Pricing Decisions

**Question to always ask:** "What is our price elasticity?"

Methods to estimate:
1. **Historical data:** How did volume change when we changed prices?
2. **A/B testing:** Test different prices in different markets
3. **Conjoint analysis:** Survey-based preference analysis
4. **Competitive benchmarking:** How do competitors' prices affect our demand?

### Industry Dynamics

**High industry elasticity (commoditized market):**
- Price competition intense
- Margins compress
- Scale is critical
- Differentiation is essential for premium pricing

**Low industry elasticity (differentiated market):**
- Pricing power exists
- Margins sustainable
- Quality and brand matter more than cost

### Recession Planning

During recessions, income falls. Use income elasticity:

| Product Type | Ey | Recession Impact | Strategy |
|--------------|----|--------------------|----------|
| Luxury goods | >1 | Demand drops sharply | Cut capacity, focus on loyal customers |
| Normal goods | 0-1 | Demand drops moderately | Maintain position, modest cuts |
| Inferior goods | <0 | Demand increases | Expand capacity, capture share |

## Worked Example

### Situation
A streaming service is considering price changes. Current state:
- Price: $15/month
- Subscribers: 10 million
- Research indicates price elasticity of -1.2 (elastic)

### Analysis

**Option A: Raise price to $18 (+20%)**
```
Expected subscriber change: -1.2 × 20% = -24%
New subscribers: 7.6 million
New revenue: 7.6M × $18 = $136.8M/month
Previous revenue: 10M × $15 = $150M/month
Revenue change: -$13.2M (-8.8%)
```
**Conclusion:** Price increase HURTS revenue because demand is elastic.

**Option B: Lower price to $12 (-20%)**
```
Expected subscriber change: -1.2 × (-20%) = +24%
New subscribers: 12.4 million
New revenue: 12.4M × $12 = $148.8M/month
Revenue change: -$1.2M (-0.8%)
```
**Conclusion:** Price decrease slightly reduces revenue but gains 2.4M subscribers.

**Option C: Stay at $15**
Revenue: $150M/month (baseline)

**Recommendation:** Consider Option B for strategic reasons (market share, network effects, data) even though revenue dips slightly. The 24% subscriber increase may have long-term value beyond immediate revenue.

### Profit Consideration

Revenue isn't the whole story—we need to consider costs.

Assume:
- Variable cost per subscriber: $5/month
- Fixed costs: $50M/month

| Option | Revenue | Variable Cost | Contribution | Profit |
|--------|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Current ($15) | $150M | $50M | $100M | $50M |
| Price ↑ ($18) | $136.8M | $38M | $98.8M | $48.8M |
| Price ↓ ($12) | $148.8M | $62M | $86.8M | $36.8M |

**With costs included:** The price increase is now more attractive because it serves fewer subscribers (lower variable costs). The price decrease, despite gaining revenue, increases costs more than it increases revenue.

**Key Insight:** Pricing decisions require both elasticity (revenue) and cost structure analysis.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Assuming All Customers Have Same Elasticity
**Mistake:** "Our elasticity is -1.5."
**Reality:** Different segments have different elasticities. Price discriminate where possible.

### 2. Ignoring Time Horizon
**Mistake:** "Customers won't respond to this price increase."
**Reality:** Short-run elasticity is often lower than long-run. People adjust over time.

### 3. Confusing Revenue and Profit
**Mistake:** "Elastic demand—we should lower prices to grow revenue."
**Reality:** Revenue optimization ≠ profit optimization. Consider costs.

### 4. Treating Elasticity as Constant
**Mistake:** Using one elasticity estimate across all price ranges.
**Reality:** Elasticity varies along the demand curve. Higher prices often mean more elastic demand.

### 5. Ignoring Competitive Response
**Mistake:** "If we raise prices 10%, we'll lose only 5% of customers."
**Reality:** If competitors match, industry volume falls. If they don't match, you lose share.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Elasticity measures responsiveness** - How much quantity changes for a given price change
2. **|Ed| > 1 is elastic** - Price increases reduce revenue
3. **|Ed| < 1 is inelastic** - Price increases raise revenue
4. **Substitutes increase elasticity** - More alternatives = more price sensitivity
5. **Segment by elasticity** - Charge more to less price-sensitive segments
6. **Time matters** - Long-run elasticity usually exceeds short-run
7. **Revenue ≠ Profit** - Always consider costs alongside elasticity

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Elasticity Calculation
A software company raises prices from $99 to $129. Monthly sales drop from 5,000 to 4,200 units. Calculate the price elasticity of demand. Is demand elastic or inelastic? Should they have raised prices?

### Problem 2: Revenue Optimization
A hotel has 100 rooms. At $200/night, occupancy is 70%. Research shows price elasticity of -1.5. What price maximizes revenue? (Assume no capacity constraints.)

### Problem 3: Income Elasticity
During a recession, a retailer sees these changes:
- Premium product line: -35% sales
- Standard product line: -10% sales
- Budget product line: +15% sales

Estimate the income elasticity category for each line. How should the retailer adjust strategy?
