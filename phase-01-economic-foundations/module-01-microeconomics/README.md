# Module 1: Microeconomics

## Overview

Microeconomics is the study of how individuals and firms make decisions when facing scarcity. It provides the foundational logic for understanding markets, pricing, competition, and strategic decision-making.

For a CEO, microeconomics isn't academic theory—it's the operating system for business decisions. Every pricing decision, market entry, hiring choice, and competitive move has microeconomic foundations.

## Why Microeconomics Matters for CEOs

### Pricing Decisions
Every pricing decision is an elasticity question. How sensitive are your customers to price changes? What's the profit-maximizing price point? Microeconomics provides the framework.

### Competitive Strategy
Understanding market structures tells you what kinds of competitive moves are possible. In perfect competition, you're a price taker. In oligopoly, every move triggers responses. Game theory helps you anticipate these dynamics.

### Resource Allocation
Opportunity cost is the CEO's constant companion. Every dollar spent on one initiative is a dollar not spent elsewhere. Every hour of executive attention has alternatives. Microeconomics makes these trade-offs explicit.

### Negotiation
Understanding your counterparty's alternatives (their opportunity cost of not dealing with you) is fundamental to negotiation. Microeconomics provides the analytical foundation.

### Market Analysis
Supply and demand analysis helps you understand why markets behave as they do—and predict how they'll respond to changes in technology, regulation, or competitive dynamics.

## Connections to Other Modules

| Module | Connection |
|--------|------------|
| Module 0 (Consulting) | Microeconomics provides the "why" behind business frameworks |
| Module 2 (Macroeconomics) | Micro is firms and individuals; macro is the aggregate economy |
| Module 3 (Accounting) | Accounting measures costs; micro explains how to use that information |
| Module 6 (Valuation) | DCF relies on cash flows, which depend on micro dynamics |
| Module 12 (Strategy) | Porter's frameworks are applied microeconomics |
| Module 15 (Marketing) | Pricing strategy is elasticity in action |

## Key Frameworks Preview

| Framework | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Opportunity Cost | Every decision involves trade-offs |
| Marginal Analysis | Optimize by comparing marginal cost and benefit |
| Supply & Demand | Predict market prices and quantities |
| Elasticity | Quantify price sensitivity |
| Game Theory | Anticipate competitive responses |
| Market Structure | Understand competitive dynamics |
