# Behavioral Economics

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how human decision-making deviates from rational models
- Recognize common cognitive biases and heuristics
- Apply behavioral insights to pricing, marketing, and product design
- Use behavioral economics for better organizational decisions
- Design "nudges" that improve outcomes

---

## Introduction

Traditional economics assumes people are rational—they have consistent preferences, process information optimally, and maximize utility. Behavioral economics recognizes that real humans are predictably irrational.

For CEOs, behavioral economics explains customer behavior, employee decisions, and your own biases. It's essential for pricing, product design, negotiation, and organizational leadership.

## Core Concepts

### Bounded Rationality

**Herbert Simon's Insight:** Humans have limited cognitive capacity. We don't optimize—we "satisfice" (satisfy + suffice).

**Implications:**
- People use mental shortcuts (heuristics)
- Decisions depend on how choices are framed
- Context affects choices

### System 1 and System 2 (Kahneman)

**System 1:** Fast, automatic, intuitive, effortless
- Pattern recognition
- Emotional reactions
- Habits and instincts

**System 2:** Slow, deliberate, analytical, effortful
- Complex calculations
- Logical reasoning
- Conscious thought

**Most decisions are System 1.** This is where biases live.

## Key Biases and Heuristics

### Loss Aversion

**Definition:** Losses feel roughly twice as painful as equivalent gains feel good.

```
Utility
   │
   │      ╱ Gains
   │    ╱
   │  ╱
   │╱───────────── Reference Point
   │╲
   │  ╲
   │    ╲
   │      ╲ Losses (steeper slope)
   │
```

**Business Applications:**
- Free trials work because canceling feels like a loss
- "Money-back guarantees" reduce perceived risk
- Frame price increases as avoiding losses ("locked-in rate")
- Subscription retention: people hate losing what they have

### Anchoring

**Definition:** Initial information (even irrelevant) heavily influences subsequent judgments.

**Example:** When asked if Gandhi lived past 140 years, people estimated his death age higher than when asked if he lived past 35.

**Business Applications:**
- Start negotiations high (anchor the range)
- Show high-priced option first (makes others seem reasonable)
- Display "original price" to anchor value
- Salary negotiations: whoever states first often anchors

### Framing Effects

**Definition:** How information is presented affects decisions, even when content is identical.

**Example:**
- "90% survival rate" vs. "10% mortality rate"
- Same information, different emotional response

**Business Applications:**
- "95% fat-free" vs. "5% fat"
- "$5/day" vs. "$150/month"
- "Save $200" vs. "Pay $800 instead of $1,000"

### Mental Accounting

**Definition:** People treat money differently depending on its source or intended use.

**Examples:**
- Tax refunds spent more freely than salary
- Casino winnings ("house money") risked more
- Gift cards spent differently than cash

**Business Applications:**
- Gift cards capture mental accounting (spending feels "free")
- Bundle products to break mental accounts
- Frame payments to different mental accounts

### Status Quo Bias

**Definition:** Strong preference for the current state of affairs.

**Power of Defaults:**
- Organ donation rates vary 5x based on opt-in vs. opt-out defaults
- 401(k) participation doubles with auto-enrollment

**Business Applications:**
- Make desired option the default
- Auto-renewal subscriptions
- Pre-selected options in purchasing flows
- Switching costs leverage status quo bias

### Availability Heuristic

**Definition:** We judge probability by how easily examples come to mind.

**Examples:**
- Fear of shark attacks (dramatic, memorable) vs. heart disease (common, mundane)
- Recent events seem more likely

**Business Applications:**
- PR crises loom larger than they are
- Vivid case studies more persuasive than statistics
- Recent wins/losses weigh heavily in reviews

### Confirmation Bias

**Definition:** We seek information that confirms existing beliefs and ignore contradicting evidence.

**Business Applications:**
- Teams reinforce existing strategies
- Due diligence finds what it's looking for
- Customer feedback interpreted to support existing plans

### Present Bias (Hyperbolic Discounting)

**Definition:** We heavily weight immediate rewards over future rewards, beyond rational discounting.

**Example:** Prefer $100 today over $110 tomorrow, but prefer $110 in 31 days over $100 in 30 days. Same delay, different feeling.

**Business Applications:**
- "Buy now, pay later" exploits present bias
- Upfront discounts beat long-term savings
- Immediate rewards drive engagement

### Sunk Cost Fallacy

**Definition:** Continuing to invest based on past costs rather than future returns.

(Covered in Module 1, Topic 1 - Opportunity Cost)

### Overconfidence

**Definition:** Systematic overestimation of our own abilities and knowledge.

**Business Applications:**
- Entrepreneurs overestimate success probability
- M&A buyers overestimate synergies
- Projects underestimate time and cost

### Social Proof

**Definition:** We look to others' actions to determine our own, especially in uncertainty.

**Business Applications:**
- "Bestseller" labels
- Reviews and ratings
- "X customers bought this"
- Testimonials

### Reciprocity

**Definition:** We feel obligated to return favors.

**Business Applications:**
- Free samples
- Content marketing (give value first)
- Relationship-based selling

## Consulting Application

### Behavioral Insights in Strategy

**Pricing:**
- Use anchoring (show premium option first)
- Frame around reference points
- Default to higher tier
- Bundle to obscure individual prices

**Marketing:**
- Use social proof
- Invoke scarcity and loss aversion
- Make benefits immediate and salient
- Frame messages for System 1

**Product Design:**
- Defaults matter enormously
- Reduce friction for desired actions
- Add friction for undesired actions
- Simplify choices (paradox of choice)

### Due Diligence Debiasing

When evaluating opportunities, actively counter biases:

| Bias | Countermeasure |
|------|---------------|
| Confirmation | Assign "devil's advocate" role |
| Overconfidence | Reference class forecasting |
| Anchoring | Generate estimates before seeing anchors |
| Sunk cost | Ask "Would we start this today?" |
| Availability | Use base rates, not vivid examples |

## CEO Application

### Decision-Making

**Recognize Your Own Biases:**
- You're overconfident
- You anchor on first information
- You're loss averse
- You seek confirming evidence

**Countermeasures:**
- Require explicit alternatives before decisions
- Seek disconfirming evidence
- Use checklists
- Sleep on major decisions (engage System 2)
- Build diverse teams that challenge assumptions

### Organizational Design

**Nudge Architecture:**
Design systems that make good choices easy:

- **Default 401(k) enrollment** (status quo bias for good)
- **Opt-out vs. opt-in** for beneficial behaviors
- **Simplify good options**, add friction to bad ones
- **Make goals salient** (progress bars, dashboards)

**Meeting Design:**
- Anonymous input prevents anchoring on first speaker
- Pre-reads reduce availability bias from in-meeting statements
- Explicit criteria reduce halo effects

### Pricing Strategy

**Behavioral Pricing Tactics:**

| Tactic | Bias Exploited | Example |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Decoy pricing | Anchoring, relative evaluation | $50, $100 (decoy), $150 |
| Charm pricing | Left-digit effect | $9.99 vs. $10.00 |
| Bundling | Mental accounting | Subscription bundles |
| Free trial | Loss aversion | 30-day free, then charge |
| Limited time | Scarcity, loss aversion | "Sale ends Sunday" |

### Negotiations

**Apply Behavioral Insights:**
- Anchor first (set the range)
- Frame proposals as avoiding losses
- Build rapport (reciprocity)
- Reference social proof ("others have accepted similar terms")
- Create commitment through small yeses

## Worked Example

### Situation
An enterprise software company wants to increase conversion from trial to paid subscription. Current conversion: 15%.

### Behavioral Analysis

**Current Flow:**
1. 14-day trial
2. Trial expires
3. Prompt to enter credit card
4. Many don't convert

**Behavioral Barriers:**
- **Present bias:** Future value of software doesn't motivate today
- **Loss aversion:** Not activated (they haven't invested yet)
- **Status quo:** Default is "not paying"
- **Friction:** Credit card entry is a barrier

### Behavioral Redesign

**1. Require Credit Card Upfront (with free trial)**
- Changes default: Now they must act to cancel
- Status quo bias works FOR conversion
- Loss aversion: They feel they'll "lose" the software

**2. Extend Trial with Investment**
- 14-day trial → 30 days if they complete onboarding
- Builds sunk cost (effort invested)
- Increases usage (more to lose)

**3. Progress and Achievement**
- Show progress: "You've accomplished X with our software"
- Create loss aversion: "Don't lose your workspace"
- Social proof: "Teams like yours see 3x productivity"

**4. Reduce Friction at Conversion**
- One-click purchase
- Remember payment info
- Annual option (less frequent decisions)

**5. Decoy Pricing**
- Basic: $50/month
- Professional: $80/month (decoy - few features beyond Basic)
- Enterprise: $150/month (full features)
- Most choose Enterprise (Professional makes it look better)

### Expected Results

Industry benchmarks suggest these changes can improve conversion by 50-100%:
- Trial conversion: 15% → 22-30%
- Net revenue increase: 50-100%

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Assuming Rationality
**Mistake:** "If we explain the value, customers will understand."
**Reality:** System 1 dominates. Make value visceral and immediate.

### 2. Ignoring Defaults
**Mistake:** "Customers will pick what's best for them."
**Reality:** Defaults are powerful. Design them intentionally.

### 3. Information Overload
**Mistake:** "Give customers all the information to decide."
**Reality:** Paradox of choice—more options can reduce decisions and satisfaction.

### 4. Fighting Human Nature
**Mistake:** "We'll train people to overcome biases."
**Reality:** Biases are deeply ingrained. Design systems around them, not against them.

### 5. Manipulation vs. Nudging
**Mistake:** Using behavioral tactics against customer interests.
**Reality:** Ethical nudging helps people achieve their goals. Manipulation backfires through reputation damage and regulation.

## Key Takeaways

1. **People are predictably irrational** - Biases are systematic, not random
2. **System 1 dominates** - Most decisions are fast and automatic
3. **Loss aversion is powerful** - Losses hurt more than gains satisfy
4. **Defaults determine outcomes** - Design them intentionally
5. **Framing matters** - Same information, different presentation = different choices
6. **Anchor strategically** - First numbers set the range
7. **Design for behavior, not just logic** - Systems should work with human nature

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Pricing Redesign
A gym charges $100/month. Utilization is low and cancellation is high. Using behavioral economics, redesign the pricing structure to:
- Increase usage
- Reduce cancellation
- Maintain or increase revenue

### Problem 2: Debiasing a Decision
Your company is considering a $50M acquisition. The deal champion is enthusiastic. What biases might be affecting the decision? Design a process to counter them.

### Problem 3: Nudge Design
Employee participation in the company wellness program is 20%. Design three nudges to increase participation without mandating it or changing the financial incentives.
