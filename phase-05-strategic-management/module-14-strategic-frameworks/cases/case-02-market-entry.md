## Analysis Assignment

### Part A: Market Attractiveness (25 points)

1. Apply PESTEL analysis to India. What are the key opportunities and risks?

2. Complete the Five Forces analysis for the India sales enablement market. Rate each force.

3. Assess the India market opportunity using the Ansoff Matrix framework. Is this market development or diversification?

4. What is the strategic group structure in India? Where would CloudFirst position itself?

### Part B: Internal Assessment (20 points)

1. Apply VRIO to CloudFirst's resources for India entry. What advantages transfer?

2. Conduct a 7S assessment for India entry readiness. What gaps exist?

3. What core competencies does CloudFirst have? Are they relevant in India?

### Part C: Entry Strategy (30 points)

1. Evaluate each entry mode option using the transaction cost framework. Which minimizes transaction costs while enabling capability access?

2. Apply the "better-off" test to the acquisition option. Under what conditions would acquisition be value-creating?

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Apply market entry frameworks rigorously
- Evaluate entry mode alternatives
- Consider local market dynamics in strategy
- Develop go-to-market plans
- Integrate multiple frameworks for entry decisions

### Key Insights

**Market Assessment:**
- India market attractive (25% growth, $600M addressable)
- But highly competitive (Salesforce, Microsoft, local players)
- Price sensitivity challenges premium positioning
- Relationship-intensive market requires local presence

**Entry Mode Recommendation:**

**Recommend: Partnership first, with option for organic expansion or acquisition**

Rationale:
1. Lower initial investment and risk
2. Partner provides local knowledge and relationships
3. Tests market before major commitment
4. Maintains flexibility for future options
5. Faster time to first revenue

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Partner selection critical (IT services vs. VAR)
- Need strong partner management capability
- Invest in localization regardless of entry mode
- Pricing strategy must reflect local economics
- Consider product simplification for mid-market

### Alternative Recommendation: Wait

Could argue to wait because:
- Current markets still growing strongly
- International expansion stretches resources
- India is "emerging" with execution challenges
- Competitors will make market-building investments

Counter-argument:
- Window of opportunity may close
- Competitors establishing position
- Option value of early entry

### Common Student Errors

1. Over-relying on market size (ignoring competitive intensity)
2. Underestimating localization requirements
3. Ignoring cultural/business practice differences
4. Assuming US success translates directly
5. Not considering partnership/acquisition options
6. Focusing on entry mode without go-to-market strategy
