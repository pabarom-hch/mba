## Answer Key

### Section 1: Framework Application

**Question 1: PESTEL & Five Forces**

a) PESTEL Analysis (6 points):

| Factor | Key Elements |
|--------|--------------|
| Political | Healthcare regulation (FDA, HIPAA), Government spending on health IT |
| Economic | Healthcare spending growth, Insurance reimbursement trends |
| Social | Aging population, Health consciousness, Patient expectations |
| Technology | AI/ML advances, Interoperability standards, Cybersecurity |
| Environmental | Sustainability in healthcare, Remote care reducing footprint |
| Legal | HIPAA compliance, Data privacy laws (GDPR), Liability concerns |

b) Key O&T and Five Forces connection (6 points):

Opportunities:
- Regulatory push for digitization (political tailwind)
- Aging population driving healthcare spending (social/economic)
- Technology enabling new solutions (technological)

Threats:
- Heavy regulation creates barriers (political/legal)
- Cybersecurity requirements add cost (technological/legal)

Five Forces implications:
- Entry barriers HIGH (regulation, switching costs)
- Buyer power MODERATE (large hospital systems)
- Rivalry INCREASING (many well-funded entrants)
- Substitutes LOW (healthcare requires proven solutions)
- Supplier power LOW (tech inputs commoditized)

**Question 2: VRIO Analysis**

| Resource | V | R | I | O | Implication |
|----------|---|---|---|---|-------------|
| Data center infrastructure | Y | Y | Y | Y | Sustained advantage |
| AWS brand | Y | Y | Y | Y | Sustained advantage |
| Proprietary tech | Y | Y | Partial | Y | Temporary-Sustained |
| Flywheel model | Y | Y | Y | Y | Sustained advantage |
| Talent/culture | Y | Y | Partial | Y | Temporary-Sustained |

Key insight: AWS has multiple sources of sustained advantage, making competitive entry very difficult.

    ├── Impact/meaning
    └── Recognition
```

**Question 5: Hypothesis Development**

a) Initial hypothesis (2 points):
"Same-store sales are declining because our core customers are shifting to online channels and we haven't adapted our omnichannel experience."

b) Sub-hypotheses (3 points):
1. Traffic is declining (customers shopping elsewhere)
2. Conversion is declining (customers visiting but not buying)
3. Basket size is declining (customers buying less per visit)

c) Testing approach (3 points):
1. Traffic: Foot traffic data, parking lot counts, mall traffic trends
2. Conversion: Transaction count vs. traffic, mystery shopping, POS data
3. Basket: Average transaction value, items per basket, category mix

**Question 6: Pyramid Principle Summary**

SITUATION: Company X operates two divisions—home cleaning and personal care—but resources are spread thin. (1 point)

COMPLICATION: Home cleaning is underperforming (3% growth, 8% margins) while personal care shows strong potential (10% growth, 15% margins) if adequately resourced. (1 point)

QUESTION: Should Company X divest home cleaning to focus on personal care? (1 point)

ANSWER: Yes, Company X should divest the home cleaning division to concentrate resources on personal care. (2 points)

SUPPORTING POINTS: (2 points)
1. Personal care has 3x the growth rate and nearly 2x the margins
2. Home cleaning requires $200M investment to remain competitive
3. Divestiture proceeds ($500M estimated) would fund personal care expansion

### Section 3: Strategic Synthesis

**Question 7: SWOT to Strategy**

a) TOWS Strategic Options (8 points):

| | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|-----------|------------|
| **Opportunities** | S-O: Expand into markets vacated by major carrier, leveraging brand and low costs | W-O: Partner (codeshare) with major carrier to extend network without fleet investment |
| **Threats** | S-T: Defend home market through loyalty program enhancement and service differentiation | W-T: Pursue fleet renewal financing to improve fuel efficiency and reduce vulnerability |

b) Recommendation (4 points):
Recommend W-O (Codeshare partnership) because:
- Addresses key weakness (limited network) without major investment
- Captures opportunity (major carrier exit, business travel)
- Lower risk than expansion
- Builds capability for future growth
- Maintains cost advantage

**Question 8: Framework Selection**

a) Vertical integration decision (4 points):
- Transaction Cost Economics: Assess asset specificity, uncertainty, frequency
- Value Chain Analysis: Understand activity costs and strategic importance
- Make vs. Buy Framework: Compare internal vs. market costs and capabilities

Rationale: Integration decision is fundamentally about boundaries of the firm and comparative efficiency

b) Digital transformation alignment (4 points):
- 7S Model: Assess alignment across all organizational elements
- Capability Assessment: Identify digital capability gaps
- VRIO: Evaluate if organization has resources to execute

Rationale: Transformation execution requires organizational alignment and capability

### Section 4: Comprehensive Case

**Part A: External Analysis**

1. Five Forces Analysis (4 points):

| Force | Rating | Justification |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Entry threat | 3 | High capital needs but tech giants can enter |
| Supplier power | 4 | Content creators increasingly powerful, exclusive deals costly |
| Buyer power | 4 | Low switching costs, many alternatives, price sensitivity |
| Substitutes | 3 | Gaming, social media, user-generated content compete for time |
| Rivalry | 5 | Many well-funded competitors, price wars, content arms race |
| **Overall** | 3.8 | Unattractive, challenging economics |

2. Industry Lifecycle (4 points):
- Late growth/early maturity stage
- Subscriber growth slowing in developed markets
- Consolidation beginning (Paramount+, Discovery+)
- Focus shifting from growth to profitability
- Implications: Efficiency matters more, M&A likely, weaker players exit

**Part B: Internal Analysis**

3. VRIO Analysis (4 points):

| Resource | V | R | I | O | Result |
|----------|---|---|---|---|--------|
| Content library (Star Trek, CBS) | Y | Partial | Y | Y | Temporary advantage |
| Paramount brand | Y | N | N | Y | Parity |
| Production capability | Y | N | N | Y | Parity |
| Bundle with cable | Y | N | N | Y | Declining asset |

Conclusion: No clear sustained advantage. Content is valuable but not unique enough. Scale disadvantage significant.

4. 7S Misalignments (4 points):

Misalignment 1: Strategy ↔ Structure
- Strategy: Aggressive streaming growth
- Structure: Still organized around legacy cable/theatrical business
- Streaming not given organizational priority

Misalignment 2: Strategy ↔ Skills
- Strategy: Tech-forward streaming platform
- Skills: Traditional media production and distribution
- Lacking digital/tech talent and capabilities

**Part C: Strategic Options**

5. Three Strategic Options (6 points):

Option 1: Sell/Merge (BCG Matrix / Better-Off Test)
- Paramount is "Question Mark" without resources to become Star
- Combine with larger player (Warner, Apple, Amazon)
- Eliminate duplicative costs
- Achieve content and scale synergies

Option 2: Focus/Niche (Blue Ocean / Generic Strategies)
- Don't compete head-on with Netflix/Disney
- Focus on specific demographics (Nickelodeon = families, MTV = youth)
- Lower content spending, higher margins
- Accept smaller but profitable position

Option 3: Aggressive Investment (Ansoff / First-Mover)
- Double down on content spending
- Pursue international expansion aggressively
- Acquire smaller streaming services
- Race for scale

6. Recommendation (3 points):

**Recommend Option 1: Sell/Merge**

Better-off test application:
- Paramount alone: $2B annual streaming losses, limited scale, eroding content position
- Combined with larger player: Synergies from content combination, technology sharing, marketing efficiency
- Value to acquirer: Content library, production capabilities, customer base

Why superior to alternatives:
- Option 2 (Focus): Likely still unprofitable at small scale, continues decline
- Option 3 (Aggressive): Would require $10B+ investment with uncertain returns, shareholders unlikely to support

Paramount's shareholders would be better served by a premium sale than continued independence.
