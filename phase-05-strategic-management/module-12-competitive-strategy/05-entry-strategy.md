## Introduction

Market entry is one of the most consequential strategic decisions a firm makes. Whether entering a new geographic market, adjacent industry, or entirely new business, the entry decision requires understanding the barriers to overcome, the incumbents to challenge, and the position to establish. This chapter examines how firms successfully enter markets and what determines entry success.

## Entry Barriers Analysis

### Types of Entry Barriers

```
STRUCTURAL BARRIERS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Inherent to industry economics

1. Economies of Scale
   • Minimum efficient scale
   • Cost disadvantage for small players
   • Applies to production, R&D, marketing

2. Capital Requirements
   • Investment needed to compete
   • R&D, facilities, working capital
   • Sunk costs (unrecoverable)

3. Product Differentiation
   • Established brand loyalties
   • Customer relationships
   • Reputation and history

4. Switching Costs
   • Customer costs to change
   • Training, integration, risk
   • Lock-in effects

5. Access to Distribution
   • Channels already tied up
   • Shelf space scarcity
   • Exclusive arrangements

6. Cost Advantages Independent of Scale
   • Patents and proprietary technology
   • Favorable locations
   • Learning curve experience
   • Raw material access

STRATEGIC BARRIERS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Created by incumbent actions

1. Excess Capacity
   • Ready to increase output
   • Price war capability

2. Limit Pricing
   • Keep prices low to deter entry
   • Reduce expected profitability

3. Predatory Reputation
   • History of aggressive response
   • Signal of future behavior

4. Vertical Integration
   • Control of supply chain
   • Foreclose access to inputs

5. Product Proliferation
   • Fill all niches
   • No room for entrant positioning
```

### Barrier Assessment Framework

```
BARRIER STRENGTH ANALYSIS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Barrier Type              Strength    Overcomable?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Economies of scale        [1-5]       Yes/No/Maybe
Capital requirements      [1-5]
Product differentiation   [1-5]
Switching costs          [1-5]
Distribution access      [1-5]
Learning curve           [1-5]
Network effects          [1-5]
Regulatory               [1-5]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OVERALL BARRIER HEIGHT:   [    ]

QUESTIONS FOR EACH BARRIER:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. How significant is this barrier?
2. Does our strategy address it?
3. What resources needed to overcome?
4. Can we circumvent rather than overcome?
5. Time required to address?
```

## Entry Strategies

### Frontal Attack

```
DEFINITION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Enter directly against incumbent strengths
Compete head-to-head for same customers

REQUIREMENTS:
• Superior resources
• Significant advantage in one dimension
• Willingness to sustain losses
• Scale to match incumbent

EXAMPLE: Samsung vs. Apple in smartphones
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Samsung approach:
• Massive R&D and marketing investment
• Broad product line
• Aggressive pricing
• Manufacturing excellence

Result: #1 in market share
Cost: Years of losses, heavy investment
```

### Flanking Strategy

```
DEFINITION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Enter in segment where incumbent is weak
Avoid direct competition with leader

TYPES:
1. Geographic flank (underserved regions)
2. Segment flank (underserved customers)
3. Price flank (high or low end)
4. Channel flank (new distribution)

EXAMPLE: Japanese auto entry to US
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Strategy:
• Enter with small, fuel-efficient cars
• Segment US automakers ignored
• Build quality reputation
• Expand up-market over time

Result: Detroit caught off-guard
        Japanese eventually dominated segments
```

### Encirclement Strategy

```
DEFINITION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Enter multiple segments simultaneously
Surround incumbent from all sides

REQUIREMENTS:
• Significant resources
• Broad capabilities
• Multiple positions viable

EXAMPLE: Microsoft vs. Google
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Google's encirclement:
• Chrome browser
• Android mobile OS
• G Suite (Office competitor)
• Cloud computing
• Maps
• YouTube

Surrounded Microsoft in multiple dimensions
```

### Bypass Strategy

```
DEFINITION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Enter with new technology or business model
Make incumbent's advantages irrelevant

TYPES:
1. Technology leapfrog
2. Business model disruption
3. New market creation

EXAMPLE: Netflix vs. Blockbuster
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Netflix bypass:
• DVD-by-mail (no stores needed)
• Streaming (no physical media)
• Made Blockbuster stores obsolete
• Incumbent's "assets" became liabilities
```

### Guerrilla Entry

```
DEFINITION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Small, targeted attacks on specific niches
Avoid attention from larger incumbents
Build position incrementally

REQUIREMENTS:
• Patience
• Niche focus
• Ability to scale later

EXAMPLE: Craft beer industry
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Entry approach:
• Local/regional focus initially
• Loyal customer base
• Premium positioning
• Avoid Budweiser/Miller attention

Result: Craft grew from 1% to 13% of market
        Large brewers eventually acquired many
```

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Identify strategic dimensions
   • Price point
   • Quality/differentiation
   • Scope (broad/narrow)
   • Distribution channels
   • Geographic coverage
   • Vertical integration

2. Select two most important
   • Dimensions that divide industry
   • Strategic importance

3. Plot competitors

4. Draw circles around clusters

5. Analyze implications

EXAMPLE: HOTEL INDUSTRY MAP

### Barrier Circumvention Strategies

```
BARRIER                CIRCUMVENTION APPROACH
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Economies of scale     • Focus on niche (lower scale needs)
                       • Outsource to achieve scale indirectly
                       • New technology (lower MES)
                       • Alliance with established player

Capital requirements   • Lean startup approach

Distribution           • Direct-to-consumer
                       • E-commerce channels
                       • New channel creation
                       • Alliance with distributors

Patents                • Invent around
                       • License technology
                       • Wait for expiry
                       • Challenge validity
```

### Entry Success Factors
