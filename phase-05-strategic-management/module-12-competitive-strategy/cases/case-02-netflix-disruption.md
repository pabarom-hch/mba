# Case Study: Netflix vs. Blockbuster - The Disruption of Video Rental

## Executive Summary

The rise of Netflix and fall of Blockbuster represents one of the most dramatic disruption stories in business history. At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster had 9,000 stores, 84,000 employees, and $6 billion in revenue. By 2010, it was bankrupt. Meanwhile, Netflix evolved from a DVD-by-mail startup to a global streaming giant worth over $150 billion. This case examines the competitive dynamics, strategic decisions, and disruptive patterns that transformed the entertainment industry.

**Key Question:** Why did Blockbuster fail to respond effectively to Netflix's disruption, and what strategic lessons can be drawn from this transformation?

## Exhibit 2: Disruptive Innovation Analysis

### Christensen's Framework Applied

```
DISRUPTION PATTERN:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
         │ PERFORMANCE
         │
MAINSTREAM│                    ┌─── Blockbuster

         │
         └────────────────────────────────────────▶
                              TIME

CLASSIC DISRUPTION CHARACTERISTICS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Entered low-end of market (catalog titles)
2. Worse on key metric (no new releases immediately)
3. Better on new dimension (convenience, no late fees)
4. Improved over time
5. Eventually surpassed incumbent
```

### Netflix's Entry Strategy

```
WHY NETFLIX SUCCEEDED ENTERING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. UNDERSERVED SEGMENT
   - Movie enthusiasts wanting selection
   - Customers tired of late fees
   - Suburban customers far from stores

2. ASYMMETRIC MOTIVATION
   - Netflix: Subscription = predictable revenue
   - Blockbuster: Late fees = $800M profit driver

3. DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES
   - Netflix: Technology, logistics, data
   - Blockbuster: Real estate, store operations

4. BUSINESS MODEL CONFLICT
   - Netflix: No late fees
   - Blockbuster: Late fees essential to model
```

## Exhibit 3: Blockbuster's Response

### The 2004-2007 Battle

```
BLOCKBUSTER ONLINE LAUNCH (2004):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Response: Copy Netflix model
Investment: Significant (hundreds of millions)
Pricing: Matched Netflix ($17.99/month)
Advantage: In-store exchanges

TOTAL ACCESS PROGRAM (2006):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Innovation: Return DVDs to stores OR mail
           Get free in-store rental while waiting

This was WORKING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Netflix growth slowed
• Blockbuster gained online subscribers
• Reed Hastings considered selling Netflix
• By 2007: 2 million online subscribers

SUBSCRIBER GROWTH COMPARISON:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Year    Netflix     Blockbuster Online
2004    2.6M        0
2005    4.2M        1.0M
2006    6.3M        2.0M
2007    7.5M        2.6M
```

### Why Blockbuster Retreated

```
THE STRATEGIC RETREAT (2007-2008):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Problem 1: FINANCIAL PRESSURE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Online business lost $400M+ cumulatively
• Store operations declining
• Franchisees opposed online (cannibalization)
• Wall Street demanded profitability

Problem 2: CEO CHANGE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• John Antioco (architect of Total Access) ousted
• Jim Keyes (former 7-Eleven CEO) appointed
• Keyes focused on stores, retail
• Cut online investment

Problem 3: ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Online team vs. store operations
• Franchisees threatened litigation
• Internal resistance to cannibalization
• Short-term profit vs. long-term survival

THE FATAL DECISION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2007: Blockbuster reduces Total Access benefits
      Raised prices, limited exchanges
      Netflix subscriber growth resumed

"We were winning and then we stopped."
      - Former Blockbuster executive
```

## Exhibit 4: The Streaming Transition

### Netflix's Second Disruption

```
STREAMING LAUNCH (2007):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Initial offering: Watch Now (1,000 titles)
Price: Included with DVD subscription
Quality: Lower than DVD
Selection: Limited (no new releases)

STREAMING EVOLUTION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Year    Streaming Titles    Quality    Subscribers
2007    1,000              SD only     7.5M

2013    100,000            Full HD     40M
2016    150,000+           4K added    89M
2024    Extensive          4K/HDR      260M+

WHY STREAMING WON:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Instant gratification (no waiting)
• Broadband adoption
• Device proliferation (smart TVs, mobile)
• No physical inventory
• Global scalability
```

### Blockbuster's Streaming Failure

```
BLOCKBUSTER STREAMING ATTEMPTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2007: Movielink acquisition (too late, wrong tech)
2010: Streaming service launched
      But: Already in bankruptcy

WHY BLOCKBUSTER COULDN'T STREAM:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. No streaming technology capability
2. Content deals not transferable
3. No capital for investment
4. Organizational focus on stores
5. Studios favored Netflix as partner

## Analysis Questions

### Part A: Disruption Analysis (25 points)

1. Apply Christensen's disruption framework to Netflix's entry. How did Netflix follow the classic disruption pattern? What made it a disruptive rather than sustaining innovation?

2. Why was Netflix's "no late fees" model asymmetrically attractive? Explain why Blockbuster couldn't simply eliminate late fees.

3. Netflix disrupted Blockbuster, then disrupted itself with streaming. Analyze this "self-disruption" using the concepts from the hypercompetition chapter. What enabled Netflix to cannibalize its own DVD business?

4. What entry barriers did Netflix face and how did it overcome them? Use the entry strategy framework to analyze Netflix's approach.

### Part B: Competitive Dynamics (25 points)

1. Analyze Blockbuster's competitive response using game theory. Was Blockbuster's initial response (Total Access) rational? Why did they retreat?

2. What competitive signals did each company send? How credible were these signals? Apply signaling theory to key announcements.

3. Use the First-Mover/Fast-Follower framework to analyze why Blockbuster's late entry into online failed. What first-mover advantages had Netflix accumulated?

4. Why couldn't Blockbuster simply acquire Netflix when offered? What organizational and strategic factors prevented this?

### Part C: Strategic Failure Analysis (25 points)

1. Apply the "Innovator's Dilemma" to Blockbuster. What made it rational for Blockbuster to focus on stores even as Netflix grew?

2. Analyze the role of organizational structure in Blockbuster's failure. How did franchisees, store employees, and corporate structure impede response?

3. Jim Keyes focused on making Blockbuster "more like 7-Eleven" (retail snacks, convenience). Critique this strategic repositioning. Was there any viable path for Blockbuster?

4. What role did timing play? If Blockbuster had continued the Total Access investment, could they have survived? What would have been required?

### Part D: Future Strategy (25 points)

1. Netflix now faces competition from Disney+, Amazon, Apple, and others. Apply Five Forces to the streaming industry. Is it becoming less attractive? How should Netflix respond?

2. The streaming industry is experiencing "subscriber fatigue" and password-sharing crackdowns. Using competitive dynamics concepts, predict the next major moves. What is the likely equilibrium?

3. Could Netflix be disrupted like Blockbuster was? What threats could emerge, and how should Netflix defend against disruption?

4. Apply the lessons from this case to another industry facing digital disruption (banking, retail, healthcare). What should incumbents learn from Blockbuster's failure?

---

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Recognize patterns of disruptive innovation
- Understand why incumbents fail to respond to disruption
- Analyze organizational barriers to strategic change
- Apply game theory to competitive response
- Evaluate self-disruption strategies

### Key Insights

**Why Incumbents Fail:**
```
1. ASSET PARADOX
   • Blockbuster's stores were assets that became liabilities
   • Investments in physical infrastructure locked in strategy
   • Success in old model prevented adaptation

2. BUSINESS MODEL CONFLICT
   • Late fees: $800M profit vs. core customer complaint
   • Eliminating late fees meant eliminating profit
   • Netflix had no such conflict (no legacy revenue)

3. ORGANIZATIONAL RESISTANCE
   • Franchisees opposed online (cannibalization)
   • Store employees threatened
   • Corporate culture optimized for retail

4. FINANCIAL METRICS TRAP
   • Online business looked unprofitable
   • Stores still generating cash
   • Wall Street rewarded short-term profits

5. TIMING MISCALCULATION
   • "We still have time" thinking
   • Underestimated pace of change
   • Each year of delay = exponential disadvantage
```

**Netflix's Strategic Brilliance:**
```
1. CHOSE THE RIGHT BATTLES
   • Didn't compete on new releases initially
   • Won on selection and convenience
   • Built where Blockbuster was weak

2. EMBRACED CANNIBALIZATION
   • Killed own DVD business for streaming
   • Short-term pain for long-term survival
   • "Self-disruption" before competitors could

3. TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT
   • Recommendation algorithm
   • Streaming infrastructure
   • Original content production

4. CULTURE OF INNOVATION
   • Famous culture deck
   • "Freedom and responsibility"
   • Anti-bureaucracy mindset
```

### Discussion Questions

1. At what point was Blockbuster's fate sealed? Could they have survived with different decisions in 2000? 2004? 2007?

2. Why do you think Reed Hastings named the company "Netflix" (combining internet and movies) when they started with DVDs? What does this suggest about long-term vision?

3. Blockbuster's CEO John Antioco was fired for investing too heavily in online. Was this decision rational from the board's perspective?

4. Netflix is now a content studio as much as a technology company. Did they have to vertically integrate into content creation? What are the strategic implications?

5. If you were running a traditional business facing digital disruption, what specific lessons would you apply from this case?

### Alternative Ending Analysis

```
WHAT IF BLOCKBUSTER HAD BOUGHT NETFLIX (2000)?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scenario: Pay $50M for Netflix

Likely outcome:
• Netflix team probably would have left
• Blockbuster culture would have dominated
• Online would have been "managed" by store-focused execs
• Same result, just different path

The problem wasn't the opportunity—it was the capability

WHAT IF BLOCKBUSTER CONTINUED TOTAL ACCESS (2007)?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scenario: Keep investing despite losses

Possible outcome:
• Could have remained competitive in DVD-by-mail
• But streaming transition still would have been challenge
• Stores still would have declined
• Might have bought time, but unclear path to victory

Best case: Survive as smaller player
Most likely: Delayed but similar outcome
```

## Epilogue

### The Last Blockbuster

In Bend, Oregon, one Blockbuster remains open. It has become a tourist attraction and time capsule, offering a nostalgic experience of Friday night video rental. The store thrives on its novelty value—the opposite of why Blockbuster once succeeded.

### Netflix's Continued Evolution

Netflix continues to evolve: ad-supported tiers, password-sharing crackdowns, gaming, and live events. Whether Netflix can maintain its position in an increasingly competitive streaming market remains uncertain. The company that disrupted Blockbuster may itself face disruption—the cycle continues.

### Final Reflection

```
"If you can't beat them, join them. If you can't join them,
acquire them. If you can't acquire them, learn from them.
If you won't learn from them, you become the case study
others learn from."

The question is not whether disruption will come—it always
does. The question is whether you will be the disruptor or
the disrupted.
```
