## Exhibit 4: Distribution and Value Chain

### The Franchise Bottler System

```
TRADITIONAL MODEL (Coca-Cola):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Concentrate maker          →    Bottlers
(Coca-Cola Company)              (independent franchises)
- Makes syrup/concentrate        - Buy concentrate
- National marketing             - Add water, carbonate
- Brand management               - Bottle/can
- R&D, new products             - Distribute locally
                                 - Local marketing

ECONOMICS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Concentrate margins: 60%+
Bottler margins: 8-12%
Capital intensity: Bottler bears

EVOLUTION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2010s: Both companies bought back bottlers
2017+: Coca-Cola refranchising (returned to partners)
Goal: Optimize ownership vs. control trade-off
```

### Distribution Channels

```
CHANNEL MIX (US):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Supermarkets: 35%
Mass merchandisers: 20%
Convenience/gas: 20%
Fountains/restaurants: 15%
Vending machines: 10%

STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Each channel has different economics
Fountain deals are exclusive and long-term:
- McDonald's: Coca-Cola (since 1955)
- Taco Bell, Pizza Hut: Pepsi (legacy from ownership)
- Subway: Recently switched to Pepsi

Shelf space is scarce and valuable
Pay-for-placement (slotting fees)
```

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Apply Five Forces to a concentrated industry
- Analyze duopoly competitive dynamics
- Understand value chain and vertical structure decisions
- Evaluate diversification and portfolio strategy
- Predict competitive evolution

### Key Insights

**Why This Industry Is Profitable:**
```
1. Entry barriers (brand, distribution, scale)
2. Duopoly coordination (tacit pricing)
3. Differentiated products (brand loyalty)
4. Low buyer power (fragmented consumers)
5. Commodity inputs (no supplier power)
```

**The Competitive Dynamic:**
```
Intense non-price competition:
• Advertising battles (billions spent)
• Innovation race (new products)
• Distribution wars (fountain deals)
• International expansion

But disciplined on price:
• Avoid profit-destroying wars
• Focus on value rather than volume
• Recognize interdependence
• Long-term orientation
```

**New Coke Lessons:**
```
1. Competitive intelligence is valuable
2. But competitive response requires caution
3. Brand is emotional, not just functional
4. Sometimes no response is best response
5. Admitting mistakes can build loyalty
```

### Discussion Questions

1. Is the cola duopoly sustainable, or should we expect disruption from new business models?

2. Should Coca-Cola have responded differently to the Pepsi Challenge?

3. How has digital transformation affected the competitive dynamics in this industry?

4. What role does culture and heritage play in this rivalry?

5. If starting fresh today, could either company replicate their success?
