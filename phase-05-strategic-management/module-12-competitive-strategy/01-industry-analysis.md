# Industry Analysis: Porter's Five Forces

## Learning Objectives

- Apply the Five Forces framework to analyze industry structure
- Assess the profitability potential of an industry
- Identify strategic implications of each force
- Recognize common mistakes in Five Forces analysis
- Use industry analysis to inform strategic decisions

## Introduction

Industry structure determines the average profitability available to participants. Some industries consistently generate high returns (pharmaceuticals, software), while others barely cover their cost of capital (airlines, hotels). Porter's Five Forces framework explains these differences and guides strategic positioning. Understanding industry structure is the essential foundation for competitive strategy.

## The Five Forces Framework

### Conceptual Foundation

```
THE CENTRAL QUESTION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Why are some industries more profitable than others?

Answer: Industry structure determines how economic
        value is divided among:
        • Industry participants (firms)
        • Buyers (customers)
        • Suppliers
        • Substitutes
        • Potential entrants

The five forces shape this division of value.

## Force 1: Threat of New Entrants

### Entry Barriers

```
ECONOMIES OF SCALE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Definition: Unit costs decline with volume
Effect: New entrant must enter at scale or accept cost disadvantage

Examples:
• Semiconductor manufacturing (fabs cost $20B+)
• Automotive (minimum efficient scale ~400K units)
• Cloud computing (data center infrastructure)

Caveat: Scale advantages declining in some industries
        due to outsourcing, modularity

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Definition: Investment needed to compete
Effect: Limits pool of potential entrants

Examples:
• Aerospace: $10B+ to develop new aircraft
• Telecom: Billions for network buildout
• Pharmaceuticals: $2B+ to develop new drug

Caveat: Capital markets can overcome if returns attractive

SWITCHING COSTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Definition: Cost to buyer of changing suppliers
Effect: Incumbents protected, new entrant must offer
        significant value to overcome

Examples:
• Enterprise software (training, integration)
• Bank accounts (direct deposit setup, bill pay)
• Mobile phones (ecosystem, learned behavior)

Types:
• Transaction costs
• Learning costs
• Contractual costs
• Psychological costs

ACCESS TO DISTRIBUTION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Definition: Ability to get product to customers
Effect: Incumbents control shelf space, relationships

Examples:
• Consumer packaged goods (retail shelf space)
• Beer (three-tier distribution)
• Automotive (dealer networks)

Caveat: E-commerce reducing this barrier in some sectors

OTHER BARRIERS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Government policy (licenses, regulations)
• Patents and proprietary technology
• Brand identity and customer loyalty
• Access to raw materials
• Experience curve advantages
• Network effects
```

### Expected Retaliation

```
FACTORS INCREASING EXPECTED RETALIATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• History of aggressive response
• Incumbents with resources to fight
• Slow industry growth (zero-sum battle)
• High fixed costs (motivation to fill capacity)
• High exit barriers (can't leave, must fight)
• Highly committed incumbents (strategic importance)

SIGNALING RETALIATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Price announcements: "We will match any price"
Capacity investment: Pre-emptive expansion
Public statements: CEO threats to new entrants
Past behavior: Track record of punishing entry
```

### Entry Threat Assessment

```
ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                               Weight    Score (1-5)
                               ─────────────────────
Economies of scale              0.15     [     ]
Capital requirements            0.15     [     ]
Switching costs                 0.15     [     ]
Distribution access             0.10     [     ]
Patents/proprietary tech        0.10     [     ]
Government policy               0.10     [     ]
Brand identity                  0.10     [     ]
Expected retaliation            0.15     [     ]
                               ─────────────────────
Weighted Score:                          [     ]

1 = Very easy entry (high threat)
5 = Very difficult entry (low threat)
```

---

## Force 2: Bargaining Power of Suppliers

### Determinants of Supplier Power

```
SUPPLIER CONCENTRATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
More concentrated than buying industry?
Few suppliers serving many buyers = HIGH power

Examples:
• Intel in PC industry (dominated x86)
• Visa/Mastercard to merchants
• TSMC in semiconductor foundry

SWITCHING COSTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
How costly to change suppliers?
High switching costs = HIGH power

Examples:
• ERP software vendors
• Specialty chemical suppliers
• Contract manufacturers with learning

SUBSTITUTE INPUTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Are there alternative inputs available?
No substitutes = HIGH power

Examples:
• Helium (no substitute for certain uses)
• Rare earth elements
• Proprietary components

IMPORTANCE TO SUPPLIER:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Is your industry important to supplier's profits?
Not important = HIGH power (supplier can walk away)

FORWARD INTEGRATION THREAT:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Can supplier become competitor?
Credible threat = HIGH power

Examples:
• Netflix producing content (vs. licensing)
• Amazon entering products it sells
• Apple designing own chips
```

### Managing Supplier Power

```
STRATEGIES TO REDUCE SUPPLIER POWER:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. DEVELOP MULTIPLE SOURCES
   Never depend on single supplier
   Foster competition among suppliers

2. BACKWARD INTEGRATION THREAT
   Demonstrate ability to make input yourself
   Keeps supplier honest on pricing

3. STANDARDIZE INPUTS
   Design to use commodity inputs
   Multiple suppliers can compete

4. INCREASE IMPORTANCE TO SUPPLIER
   Become major customer
   Gain volume discounts and attention

5. BUILD SWITCHING COSTS FOR SUPPLIER
   Integration, joint development
   Makes leaving you costly for them
```

---

## Force 3: Bargaining Power of Buyers

### Determinants of Buyer Power

```
BUYER CONCENTRATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Few buyers purchasing large volumes?
Concentrated buyers = HIGH power

Examples:
• Walmart negotiating with P&G
• Auto OEMs with parts suppliers
• Retail chains with food producers

SWITCHING COSTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
How costly for buyer to switch suppliers?
Low switching costs = HIGH power

Examples:
• Commodity products (can easily switch)
• Standard specifications
• Auction-based purchasing

BUYER INFORMATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Does buyer know your costs and alternatives?
High information = HIGH power

Examples:
• Internet price comparison
• Professional purchasing departments
• Public bidding requirements

THREAT OF BACKWARD INTEGRATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Can buyer make it themselves?
Credible threat = HIGH power

Examples:
• Retailers with private labels
• OEMs insourcing components
• Large customers setting up in-house

PRICE SENSITIVITY:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
How important is price to buyer's purchase decision?

High sensitivity when:
• Product is large % of buyer's costs
• Buyer is under profit pressure
• Product doesn't affect quality
• Commodity (no differentiation)
```

### Buyer Power Assessment

```
B2B VS. B2C BUYERS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Business buyers:
• Professional purchasing
• Negotiation leverage
• Volume discounts expected
• Long-term contracts possible

Consumer buyers:
• Generally fragmented (low power)
• But: Review sites aggregate information
• Brand loyalty can reduce power
• Switching increasingly easy
```

---

## Force 4: Threat of Substitutes

### Identifying Substitutes

```
DEFINITION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Products from OUTSIDE the industry that serve
the same FUNCTION for the buyer

Examples:
• Video conferencing vs. air travel
• Streaming vs. cable TV
• Plant-based meat vs. traditional meat
• Email vs. postal mail

NOT substitutes:
• Different brands within industry (that's rivalry)
• Different quality tiers within industry

KEY QUESTION:
"What else could accomplish the same job for the buyer?"
```

### Substitute Threat Assessment

```
PRICE-PERFORMANCE TRADE-OFF:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Is substitute offering better value?
If yes: HIGH threat

Calculation:
Substitute value = Substitute benefit / Substitute price
Industry value = Industry benefit / Industry price

If substitute value > industry value: Threat is high

SWITCHING COSTS TO SUBSTITUTE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
How costly to change to substitute?
Low switching costs = HIGH threat

BUYER PROPENSITY TO SWITCH:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
How willing are buyers to change?
Cultural factors, habits, risk tolerance
```

### Strategic Implications

```
RESPONDING TO SUBSTITUTES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. IMPROVE RELATIVE PRICE-PERFORMANCE
   Reduce costs, improve product
   Make your offering more attractive

2. INCREASE SWITCHING COSTS
   Integration, loyalty programs
   Make leaving costly

3. COLLECTIVE INDUSTRY ACTION
   Joint marketing to promote category
   (e.g., "Got Milk?" campaign)

4. CO-OPT THE SUBSTITUTE
   Acquire or partner with substitute providers
   Diversify into substitute industry
```

---

## Force 5: Intensity of Rivalry

### Rivalry Determinants

```
NUMBER AND SIZE OF COMPETITORS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
More competitors = MORE rivalry
Equal size = MORE rivalry (no clear leader)

Types:
• Monopoly: No rivalry
• Oligopoly: Varies (can be cooperative or intense)
• Many competitors: Generally intense

INDUSTRY GROWTH:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
High growth: Share gains possible without conflict
Low growth: Zero-sum game = INTENSE rivalry

Growth rates by industry:
• Cloud computing: 20%+ (lower rivalry)
• Traditional retail: 1-2% (higher rivalry)
• Decline: Negative (most intense)

FIXED COSTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
High fixed costs = Motivation to fill capacity
Price cutting to utilize fixed assets = INTENSE rivalry

Examples:
• Airlines (fill the plane)
• Hotels (fill the rooms)
• Semiconductors (run the fab)

PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Low differentiation (commodity) = Price competition = INTENSE
High differentiation = Competition on attributes, less intense

SWITCHING COSTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Low switching costs: Easy for customers to switch
Creates intense competition for each sale

EXIT BARRIERS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
High exit barriers = Excess capacity persists
Firms stay even when losing money = INTENSE rivalry

Exit barriers:
• Specialized assets (no other use)
• Labor agreements
• Strategic interrelationships
• Emotional barriers (management ego)
• Government restrictions
```

### Rivalry Patterns

```
PRICE VS. NON-PRICE COMPETITION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Price competition:
• Reduces industry profitability
• Zero-sum (mostly)
• Common in commodities

Non-price competition:
• Can expand market
• Builds differentiation
• Innovation, service, brand

STABLE VS. UNSTABLE RIVALRY:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Stable:
• Clear market leader
• Understood "rules"
• Differentiated positions
• Consistent pricing

Unstable:
• No clear leader
• Frequent price changes
• Capacity additions
• Merger/acquisition activity
```

## Common Mistakes

### Analytical Errors

```
MISTAKE 1: CONFUSING INDUSTRY WITH SEGMENT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wrong: "Technology industry" analysis
Right: "Enterprise SaaS for HR functions"
Define industry boundaries precisely

MISTAKE 2: LISTING FORCES, NOT ANALYZING
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wrong: "Supplier power is high because there are few suppliers"
Right: "There are few suppliers, each controls X%, switching
       costs are $Y, so supplier power is HIGH and affects
       margins by Z%"

MISTAKE 3: SNAPSHOT, NOT TRENDS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wrong: Static analysis of current state
Right: How are forces changing? What's the trajectory?

MISTAKE 4: IGNORING STRATEGIC GROUPS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Forces may differ for different positions in industry
Luxury hotels face different buyer power than budget hotels

MISTAKE 5: CONFUSING GROWTH WITH ATTRACTIVENESS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Growing industry ≠ Profitable industry
Many high-growth industries attract entry and rivalry
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Industry structure drives profitability** - Not all industries equally attractive
2. **Five forces explain profit division** - Value goes to those with power
3. **Entry barriers protect incumbents** - Scale, capital, switching costs, brand
4. **Supplier and buyer power extract value** - Balance determines margins
5. **Substitutes cap prices** - Must match substitute value proposition
6. **Rivalry erodes profits** - Especially in commodity industries with high fixed costs
7. **Forces are dynamic** - Analyze trends, not just current state
8. **Industry boundaries matter** - Define the competitive arena precisely
