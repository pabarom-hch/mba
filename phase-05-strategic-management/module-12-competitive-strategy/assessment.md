## Section 4: Comprehensive Case Analysis (25 points)

### The Ride-Sharing Wars

**Background:**

Uber and Lyft have competed intensely in the U.S. ride-sharing market since 2012. Both companies have similar offerings: app-based ride hailing, dynamic pricing, driver networks. After years of price wars and aggressive expansion, both companies struggled to achieve profitability.

**Market Data:**
- U.S. ride-sharing market: ~$75 billion (2023)
- Market share: Uber 68%, Lyft 32%
- Both companies have operated at losses for most of their existence
- Driver acquisition and retention costs are substantial
- Regulatory challenges vary by city/state
- Autonomous vehicles loom as potential disruption

**Financial Performance:**
- Uber: Revenue $31B (2023), Net income recently turned positive
- Lyft: Revenue $4B (2023), Still operating at losses
- Both raised billions in venture capital and went public

---

   - Continue competing nationally against Uber?
   - Focus on specific geographies or segments?
   - Differentiate on a specific dimension?
   - Pursue a merger or exit?

   Justify your recommendation with strategic logic. (5 points)

7. How should both companies prepare for the autonomous vehicle disruption? Consider first-mover vs. fast-follower dynamics. (3 points)

## Answer Key

### Section 1: Five Forces Analysis

**Question 1: Streaming Video**

| Force | Rating | Key Factors | Profitability Impact |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Entry Threat | 3 | High capital for content, but tech players can enter; moderate barriers | Moderate pressure from new entrants |
| Supplier Power | 4 | Content creators increasingly powerful; exclusive deals costly; talent commands premium | Significant pressure on margins |
| Buyer Power | 4 | Low switching costs; price sensitivity; multiple options | Downward pressure on pricing |
| Substitutes | 3 | Gaming, social media, traditional TV compete for time; but streaming integrated into life | Some substitution pressure |
| Rivalry | 5 | Many well-funded competitors; price wars; content spending arms race | Intense margin pressure |

**Overall Assessment:** Moderately unattractive (3.8/5 threat level)
- Content costs escalating
- Subscriber growth slowing
- Consolidation likely
- Profitability challenged

**Question 2: Airlines vs. Enterprise Software**

| Force | Airlines | Software |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Entry | 3 | 2 |
| Supplier | 4 | 2 |
| Buyer | 4 | 2 |
| Substitutes | 3 | 2 |
| Rivalry | 5 | 3 |
| Average | 3.8 | 2.2 |

Airlines unattractive because:
- High fixed costs (perishable inventory)
- Strong suppliers (Boeing/Airbus duopoly, unions)
- Price transparency (aggregators)
- Commodity product (in economy)

Software attractive because:
- High switching costs
- Recurring revenue
- Scale economics
- Lower capital requirements
- Network effects possible

### Section 2: Competitive Positioning

**Question 3: Generic Strategies**

a) **Costco** - Cost Leadership
   - Bulk purchasing power (lower supplier costs)
   - Limited SKUs (operational efficiency)

b) **Ferrari** - Focused Differentiation
   - Limited production (exclusivity)
   - Racing heritage and brand (emotional appeal)

c) **Southwest** - Cost Leadership
   - Single aircraft type (operational efficiency)
   - No-frills service (lower costs)

d) **Rolex** - Focused Differentiation
   - Premium materials and craftsmanship
   - Brand as status symbol

e) **IKEA** - Cost Leadership (with hybrid elements)
   - Flat-pack design (logistics efficiency)
   - Self-service model (lower labor costs)

**Question 4: Stuck in the Middle**

a) **Why problematic:**
- Neither cheapest (value players undercut)
- Nor best quality (premium players differentiate better)
- Unclear customer target
- Conflicting operational requirements

b) **Symptoms:**
- Below-average margins
- Unclear brand perception
- Losing share to specialists
- Difficulty attracting talent
- Customer confusion

c) **Repositioning recommendation:**
Choose one direction:
- Premium: Invest in experience, quality, service; accept lower volume
- Value: Streamline operations, reduce complexity, compete on price
Trade-off example: If going premium, eliminate value menu, invest in ambiance, accept some customer loss

**Question 5: Amazon Value Chain**

1. **Operations (Fulfillment)** - Cost Leadership
   - Massive warehouse network
   - Robotics automation
   - Prime delivery speed

2. **Technology Development** - Both
   - AWS platform advantages
   - Recommendation algorithms
   - Voice assistant (Alexa)

3. **Procurement** - Cost Leadership
   - Scale purchasing power
   - Direct from manufacturers
   - Private label competition

### Section 3: Competitive Dynamics

**Question 6: Payoff Matrix**

a) **Dominant strategies:**
Neither player has a dominant strategy.
If B launches: A prefers Launch (20 > 10)
If B doesn't: A prefers Launch (50 > 30)
Wait - A does have dominant strategy: Launch
Similarly for B: Launch is dominant

b) **Nash equilibrium:**
(Launch, Launch) with payoffs (20, 20)
Both launch, neither wants to unilaterally change

c) **Prisoner's Dilemma?**
YES - Nash equilibrium (20, 20) is not Pareto optimal
Both "Don't Launch" (30, 30) would be better for both
But individual incentives drive to inferior outcome

d) **Repeated game:**
Could sustain (Don't Launch, Don't Launch) through:
- Tit-for-tat strategies
- Reputation for cooperation
- Long-term relationship
- Credible punishment threats

**Question 7: SpaceX First-Mover**

a) **First-mover advantages captured:**
- Learning curve in reusable rockets
- Reputation for innovation
- Cost position through iteration
- Government contracts (market share)
- Talent attraction

b) **Why incumbents didn't respond:**
- Innovator's dilemma (existing contracts profitable)
- Organizational inertia
- Sunk costs in existing technology
- NASA/government relationships comfortable
- Didn't believe reusability would work

c) **Entry barriers overcome:**
- Capital: Raised from venture capital, later self-funded
- Technology: Vertical integration, proprietary development
- Relationships: Won NASA contracts
- Expertise: Hired from NASA, aerospace

**Question 8: Semiconductor Signaling**

a) **Signal being sent:**
"We are committed to this market long-term"
"We will have capacity to compete aggressively"
"Don't enter or expand - we will dominate"

b) **Directed to:**
- Potential entrants (deterrence)
- Existing competitors (warning)
- Customers (reliability assurance)
- Investors (commitment to growth)

c) **Making credible:**
- $20B is sunk cost once spent
- Public announcement (CEO reputation)
- Contracts with suppliers
- Hiring engineers
- Government subsidies (can't be returned)

### Section 4: Comprehensive Case

**Part A: Industry Analysis**

1. **Five Forces:**
| Force | Rating | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Entry | 3 | Low capital needs, but network effects create some barrier |
| Supplier | 4 | Drivers have bargaining power; can switch apps |
| Buyer | 5 | Very low switching costs; price comparison easy |
| Substitutes | 3 | Taxis, transit, personal vehicles; but convenience difference |
| Rivalry | 5 | Duopoly but intense; price wars; driver subsidies |

2. **Why unprofitable:**
- Buyer power prevents price increases
- Driver supply expensive to maintain (supplier power)
- Low differentiation drives price competition
- No true barriers to switching
- Winner-take-all dynamics without winner emerging

**Part B: Competitive Dynamics**

3. **Game characterization:**
- Prisoner's Dilemma structure (price cutting)
- Both better off with higher prices, but incentive to undercut
- Network effects create "Chicken game" for dominance
- Repeated game with hope of eventual sustainability

4. **No sustainable advantage because:**
- No switching costs
- Identical product
- Multi-homing (drivers and riders use both)
- Technology easily copied

To achieve advantage:
- Create switching costs (subscriptions, loyalty)
- Differentiate meaningfully
- Vertical integration (AV)
- Network density advantages

5. **Signals:**
- Uber: Geographic expansion (commitment)
- Lyft: Safety focus (differentiation attempt)
- Both: IPO signals long-term commitment
- Driver bonuses: Unsustainable signals

**Part C: Strategic Recommendations**

6. **Lyft strategy recommendation:**
Focus strategy recommended:
- Geographic focus (top 10 markets)
- Exit unprofitable markets
- Differentiate on safety/service
- Target specific segments (corporate, airport)

Justification:
- Cannot outspend Uber
- National breadth not valuable
- Local density creates advantage
- Profitability over growth

7. **Autonomous vehicle preparation:**
For both:
- Invest in AV technology (hedge)
- Partner with AV developers
- Position for future where driver cost eliminated
- Consider vertical integration

First-mover risk high (technology uncertain)
Fast-follower may work (let others prove technology)
Must have seat at table when AV arrives
