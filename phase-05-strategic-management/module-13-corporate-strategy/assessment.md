## Answer Key

### Section 1: Scope and Diversification

**Question 1: Amazon Pharmacy**

a) Three tests (6 points):

**Attractiveness Test (2 points):**
- Pharmacy industry moderately attractive
- High margins in retail pharmacy
- Consolidating industry
- PBM economics complex
- BUT: Regulatory complexity, thin distribution margins
- PASS (conditionally)

**Cost-of-Entry Test (2 points):**
- Amazon acquired PillPack ($750M) - reasonable entry
- Organic entry would be expensive (licensing, infrastructure)
- Cost reasonable relative to Amazon's scale
- PASS

**Better-Off Test (2 points):**
- Amazon brings: Prime ecosystem, logistics, technology
- Pharmacy benefits from: distribution efficiency, customer base
- Genuine synergies with Amazon's existing capabilities
- PASS

Conclusion: Diversification justified

b) Related or Unrelated (4 points):
**Related diversification** because:
- Same customers (Prime members)
- Leverages logistics infrastructure
- E-commerce platform applicable
- Customer data and personalization
- Technology capabilities transfer
- Supply chain expertise applies

---

**Question 2: Tesla Integration**

a) Three internally performed activities (3 points):
1. Battery cell manufacturing (Gigafactory)
2. Software/autopilot development
3. Direct sales (no dealers)

Additional possibilities: Motors, electronics, charging network

b) Justification using TCE (3 points):

**Battery manufacturing:**
- High asset specificity (custom cells for vehicles)
- High uncertainty (evolving technology)
- Strategic importance (core to EV)
- Justified: Transaction costs would be high

**Software development:**
- High asset specificity (vehicle-specific)
- Core to differentiation
- Rapid iteration required
- Justified: Would lose control and speed

**Direct sales:**
- Customer relationship ownership
- Brand experience control
- Data access
- Justified: Traditional dealers misalign incentives

c) Risks of high integration (2 points):
- Capital intensity (significant investment required)
- Operational complexity (must be excellent at many things)
- Flexibility constraints (harder to change direction)
- Scaling challenges (all bottlenecks internal)

---

**Question 3: 3M vs. Apple**

a) More diversified (1 point):
**3M is more diversified** - businesses in unrelated industries

b) Higher synergies (3 points):
**Apple has higher synergies** because:
- All products share iOS/macOS ecosystem
- Same customers across product lines
- Tight integration between hardware/software/services
- Cross-selling built into design (iPhone users buy AirPods, Watch)
- Common brand identity

3M has lower synergies:
- Limited customer overlap
- Different technologies
- Separate manufacturing
- Distinct channels

c) Best owner test (3 points):

**3M Healthcare (example):**
- Could be better owned by a pure healthcare company
- Danaher or J&J might add more operational value
- 3M's diversified parenting not optimal
- Candidate for spin-off or sale

**Apple Services:**
- Apple is clearly best owner
- Tightly integrated with devices
- Customer base is unique asset
- No other parent could add equivalent value
- Should definitely remain with Apple

---

### Section 2: M&A Strategy

**Question 4: Acquisition Valuation**

a) Standalone value (2 points):
- Low: $100M × 10 = $1,000M
- High: $100M × 12 = $1,200M
- Range: $1.0B - $1.2B

b) Synergy value (4 points):
```
Year 1: $25M / 1.10 = $22.7M
Year 2: $25M / 1.21 = $20.7M
Year 3: $25M / 1.33 = $18.8M
Terminal value: ($25M / 0.10) / 1.33 = $188M

Total synergy PV = $250M (approximately)

Less integration costs: $50M
Net synergy value: $200M
```

c) Should proceed? (4 points):
```
Standalone value (midpoint): $1,100M
35% premium = $385M
Acquisition price: $1,485M

Net synergy value: $200M
Combined value: $1,300M ($1,100M + $200M synergy)

Value to acquirer: $1,300M - $1,485M = ($185M)

RECOMMEND: DO NOT PROCEED
The premium exceeds the synergy value
```

d) Non-financial factors (2 points):
- Cultural compatibility
- Key talent retention
- Strategic importance/optionality
- Customer reaction
- Competitive response
- Integration capability/bandwidth

---

**Question 5: Integration Strategy**

a) Recommended approach (3 points):
**Partial integration** because:
- Different industries (software vs. hardware)
- Need to preserve hardware expertise
- Cultural differences likely significant
- Integration points specific (product integration)
- But: Need coordination for integrated solution

b) Critical risks and mitigation (3 points):

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Talent loss (hardware) | Retention bonuses, clear roles, involvement in integration |
| Culture clash | Cultural integration program, joint teams, leadership modeling |
| Customer disruption | Proactive communication, service continuity, key account management |

c) 100-day plan (2 points):
- Day 1: Leadership announcement, employee communication
- Days 1-30: Team integration, quick wins, customer outreach
- Days 30-60: Organization finalized, product roadmap aligned
- Days 60-100: Key synergies initiated, steady-state operations

---

**Question 6: Why M&A Fails**

a) Three reasons (2 points):
1. Overpayment (premium exceeds synergies)
2. Integration failure (culture, execution)
3. Strategic mismatch (wrong target for strategy)

b) Prevention (3 points):
1. Overpayment: Set maximum price before bidding, walk away discipline
2. Integration failure: Detailed integration planning pre-close, experienced integration team
3. Strategic mismatch: Rigorous strategic diligence, clear rationale with specific synergies

---

### Section 3: Portfolio Management

**Question 7: BCG Matrix**

a) Relative market share (2 points):
- Power Systems: 25%/15% = 1.67 (High)
- Healthcare Equipment: 10%/30% = 0.33 (Low)
- Water Technology: 35%/20% = 1.75 (High)
- Legacy Industrial: 8%/25% = 0.32 (Low)

b) BCG matrix positions (3 points):
- **Power Systems**: Cash Cow (high share, low growth)
- **Healthcare Equipment**: Question Mark (low share, high growth)
- **Water Technology**: Star (high share, high growth)
- **Legacy Industrial**: Dog (low share, negative growth)

c) Capital allocation (3 points):
- Water Technology (Star): 45% - protect and grow leadership
- Healthcare Equipment (Question Mark): 30% - invest to build position
- Power Systems (Cash Cow): 20% - maintain position
- Legacy Industrial (Dog): 5% - minimal investment, manage for cash

Justification: Fund stars and promising question marks from cash cows; minimize investment in dogs

d) Divestiture candidates (2 points):
**Legacy Industrial** - declining market, weak position, no path to leadership, tying up resources that could be redeployed

---

**Question 8: Parenting Matrix**

a) Quadrant placement (2 points):
- A (Core Manufacturing): Heartland (low opportunity, high fit)
- B (New Tech Venture): Ballast (high opportunity, high fit)
- C (Financial Services): Value Trap (high opportunity, low fit)
- D (Unrelated Retail): Alien Territory (low opportunity, low fit)

b) Strategy recommendations (4 points):
- **A (Heartland)**: Hold/maintain - core business, focus resources here
- **B (Ballast)**: Invest/develop - we can add value, opportunity exists
- **C (Value Trap)**: Divest - needs help we can't provide, wrong parent
- **D (Alien Territory)**: Divest - no fit, better owner exists

c) First priority (2 points):
**Business C (Financial Services)** - value trap is most dangerous because it appears attractive but we'll likely destroy value. Exit before more resources wasted.

---

**Question 9: Conglomerate Discount**

a) Conglomerate discount explained (3 points):
- Market values sum of parts higher than combined company
- Causes: complexity premium, agency costs, cross-subsidization concerns, lack of transparency, belief corporate doesn't add value

b) Restructuring recommendation (2 points):
- Spin off businesses into focused companies
- Or: Divest non-core units to strategic buyers

- Increase transparency

c) Risks (2 points):
- Execution risk in separation
- Loss of any genuine synergies
- Tax implications
- Transition costs
- Management distraction

### Section 4: Disney Case

**Part A: Acquisition Strategy**

1. Marvel better-off test (4 points):
Synergies Disney captured:
- Character licensing across parks, merchandise, cruise ships
- Theme park attractions (Avengers Campus)
- Disney+ content (Marvel shows)
- Cross-promotion with other Disney properties
- Merchandising through Disney retail channels
- International distribution leverage
- Brand association with Disney family entertainment

Clear value creation: Marvel worth far more under Disney than independent

2. Fox vs. Marvel/Pixar/Lucasfilm (4 points):
**Differences:**
- Fox was primarily for content library and streaming scale
- More about quantity than IP synergy
- Included linear TV assets in declining business
- Much larger ($71B vs. $4-7B)
- Less "creative" synergy, more "capacity" synergy

**Strategic logic:**
- Valid for streaming wars (needed content volume)
- Questionable: Paid peak price, linear assets declining
- Mixed: Some IP valuable (Avatar, X-Men), some not
- Fox acquisition less clearly synergistic than creative studio deals

---

**Part B: Portfolio Analysis**

3. Matrix positioning (4 points):

| Segment | Growth | Position | Quadrant |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| Entertainment | High (streaming) | Strong | Star/Question Mark (losses) |
| ESPN | Declining (cord-cutting) | Strong | Cash Cow (declining) |
| Parks | Moderate | Strong | Cash Cow/Star |

4. Parenting value (3 points):
**Value-add:**
- IP leverage across all segments
- Brand management excellence
- Cross-promotion capability
- Creative talent development

**Potential value destruction:**
- Streaming losses draining resources
- ESPN decline distracting management
- Bundling may undervalue ESPN
- Corporate overhead significant

5. ESPN spin-off analysis (2 points):
- Best owner test: Sports-focused company might operate better
- ESPN's declining linear business needs transformation
- Tech company (Apple, Amazon) might be better owner
- BUT: Disney's distribution and bundling still valuable
- Recommendation: Explore strategic options but not urgent

---

**Part C: Strategic Recommendations**

6. Portfolio recommendations (5 points):
1. **Streaming**: Continue investment but set path to profitability timeline
2. **Parks**: Protect and grow - stable cash generator
3. **ESPN**: Explore strategic options (partnership, partial sale, JV with tech company)
4. **Linear TV**: Accelerate decline management, reduce costs
5. **Content**: Focus on franchise IP, reduce content volume spend

Justification:
- Parks are clear "cash cow" - protect
- Streaming is strategic but must find sustainable economics
- ESPN needs different parent capabilities (technology, sports betting)
- Linear TV is dog - harvest/exit

7. Resource allocation principles (3 points):
- Parks generate cash to fund streaming investment
- Set clear hurdles for streaming (path to profitability by year X)
- Don't starve parks to fund streaming losses indefinitely
- Apply BCG logic: cash cows fund stars/question marks, but with discipline
- Monitor streaming closely; pivot if economics don't work
