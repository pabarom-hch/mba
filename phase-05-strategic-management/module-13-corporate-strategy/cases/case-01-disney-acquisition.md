# Case Study: Disney's Acquisition Strategy

## Executive Summary

Between 2006 and 2019, The Walt Disney Company executed one of the most successful acquisition strategies in corporate history, acquiring Pixar ($7.4B), Marvel ($4B), Lucasfilm ($4B), and 21st Century Fox ($71B). These deals transformed Disney from an animation and theme park company into a diversified entertainment conglomerate and streaming powerhouse. This case examines the strategic logic, valuation, integration, and outcomes of these acquisitions.

**Key Question:** What made Disney's acquisition strategy successful when most M&A fails, and does the same logic apply to the Fox acquisition?

## Analysis Questions

### Part A: Acquisition Strategy (25 points)

1. Apply Porter's "better-off" test to the Pixar acquisition. What specific synergies did Disney create that Pixar could not have achieved independently?

2. Compare the integration approaches used for Pixar vs. Fox. Why did Disney use different approaches, and what factors determined each choice?

3. Marvel was acquired for $4 billion in 2009. Estimate the value created using box office, merchandise, parks, and streaming value. Was this Disney's best acquisition?

4. George Lucas sold Lucasfilm for $4 billion when Star Wars was dormant. Disney announced a new trilogy immediately. Analyze this transaction from both seller's and buyer's perspective.

### Part B: Strategic Logic (25 points)

1. What was the common strategic logic across the Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm acquisitions? How does Fox differ?

2. Disney paid $4 billion each for Marvel and Lucasfilm, but $71 billion for Fox. Evaluate the valuation logic for each. Was Fox overpriced?

3. How did Disney's acquisition strategy prepare it for the streaming wars? Would Disney+ have been viable without these acquisitions?

4. Analyze the "creative studio" acquisition model (Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm). Why did preservation work better than full integration?

### Part C: Integration and Execution (25 points)

1. What were the key success factors in Disney's integration of Marvel? Why did Disney avoid the typical integration failures?

2. The Fox acquisition required massive integration and layoffs. Was full integration the right approach? What alternatives existed?

3. Lucasfilm has had creative challenges (director departures, Solo underperformance). Has Disney's involvement hurt or helped the creative output?

4. Kevin Feige's autonomy at Marvel has been cited as critical to success. How should Disney balance creative independence with corporate oversight?

### Part D: Future Strategy (25 points)

1. With Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Fox, does Disney have enough franchises? What acquisition, if any, should Disney consider next?

2. Analyze Disney's portfolio using the BCG matrix. How should capital be allocated between Entertainment (streaming), ESPN, and Parks?

3. Some analysts suggest Disney should spin off ESPN. Apply the "best owner" test. Is Disney the best owner of ESPN?

4. The Fox acquisition brought X-Men and Fantastic Four back to Marvel. How should Disney integrate these characters while managing the already-crowded MCU?

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Evaluate acquisition rationale using corporate strategy frameworks
- Compare integration approaches and their determinants
- Assess acquisition performance using multiple metrics
- Apply valuation logic to transformational deals
- Understand the relationship between M&A and corporate strategy

### Key Insights

**Why Disney's Creative Acquisitions Succeeded:**
```
1. CLEAR SYNERGY LOGIC
   • Not financial engineering
   • Specific value creation mechanisms
   • Characters → Parks → Merchandise → Streaming

2. PRESERVATION OF VALUE SOURCE
   • Creative talent is the asset
   • Don't destroy what you bought
   • Retain key leadership

3. DISCIPLINED VALUATION
   • $4B for Marvel (incredible ROI)
   • $4B for Lucasfilm (excellent ROI)
   • Paid for potential, not just current

4. INTEGRATION APPROPRIATE TO DEAL
   • Pixar: Preserve completely
   • Marvel: Strategic oversight
   • Lucasfilm: Strategic oversight
   • Fox: Full integration (different asset)

5. LONG-TERM ORIENTATION
   • Built over 13 years
   • Patient capital
   • CEO continuity (Iger)
```

**Fox Acquisition Questions:**
```
1. Scale difference: $4B → $71B
2. Strategic logic: Volume, not franchise
3. Integration: Full, not preservation
4. Timing: Streaming wars desperation?
5. Premium: Raised from $52B (bidding war)

Verdict: Jury still out
• Streaming losses continue
• Linear TV declining
• Some IP valuable
• Integration disruptive
```

### Discussion Questions

1. Bob Iger has been credited with Disney's acquisition success. How much was strategy vs. CEO judgment?

2. If you were a competitor (Warner Bros, Universal), how would you respond to Disney's acquisition strategy?

3. Disney paid similar prices for Marvel ($4B) and Lucasfilm ($4B). Which was the better deal? Why?

4. The Fox deal was contested by Comcast. Did Disney overpay to win? Was winning worth the extra $19B?

5. What acquisition, if any, should Disney make next? Defend your recommendation.
