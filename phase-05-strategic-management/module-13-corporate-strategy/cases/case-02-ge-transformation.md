# Case Study: GE's Rise and Fall - The Conglomerate Question

## Executive Summary

For decades, General Electric was America's most admired company and the gold standard for corporate management. Under Jack Welch (1981-2001), GE became the world's most valuable company, validating the conglomerate model. Under Jeff Immelt (2001-2017) and his successors, GE lost 80% of its value and ultimately announced a breakup into three separate companies. This case examines the rise and fall of the most celebrated conglomerate in business history and what it teaches us about corporate strategy.

**Key Question:** Was GE's decline due to strategy, execution, luck, or fundamental flaws in the conglomerate model?

## Analysis Questions

### Part A: Conglomerate Model (25 points)

1. During the Welch era, GE was seen as proving the conglomerate model could work. What specific parenting advantages did GE claim, and were they real?

2. Apply the "conglomerate discount" concept to GE. How much of GE's peak value was real vs. financial engineering through GE Capital?

3. The GE breakup created $75B+ in value. What does this tell us about the conglomerate model? Were those synergies never real, or did they erode over time?

4. Compare GE's failure with Berkshire Hathaway's continued success. What did Berkshire do differently that GE did not?

### Part B: Strategic Mistakes (25 points)

1. Evaluate Immelt's strategy of growing GE Capital vs. shrinking it. What was the right answer at different points in his tenure?

2. The Alstom acquisition is cited as a major strategic error. Apply the three acquisition tests (attractiveness, cost-of-entry, better-off). Should GE have made this deal?

3. GE's digital transformation (Predix, GE Digital) consumed $4B+ and largely failed. Apply the diversification framework. Was this related or unrelated diversification?

4. If you were CEO in 2001 (instead of Immelt), what portfolio and strategic changes would you have made?

### Part C: Corporate Governance (25 points)

1. Immelt was CEO for 16 years despite poor performance. Analyze the board governance failures that enabled this. What should the board have done differently?

2. GE's culture of "hitting the numbers" is cited as problematic. How did the Welch-era performance culture contribute to later problems?

3. Larry Culp is the first outside CEO in GE history. What does his appointment and success say about GE's internal talent development?

4. The breakup was opposed by some who believed in "keeping GE together." Evaluate the arguments for and against the breakup.

### Part D: Lessons for Corporate Strategy (25 points)

1. What does GE's decline teach us about the limits of the conglomerate model in modern markets?

2. GE was in many "good" businesses (Aviation, Healthcare) that are now thriving independently. Why did they underperform inside GE?

3. Apply the parenting matrix to GE's 2000 portfolio. How many businesses were in the "heartland" vs. "alien territory"?

4. If you were advising a company considering a conglomerate strategy today, what lessons from GE would you emphasize?

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Critically evaluate the conglomerate model
- Understand how parenting value can erode
- Analyze corporate decline and turnaround
- Apply governance frameworks to strategic oversight
- Evaluate breakup vs. integration decisions

### Key Insights

**Why GE Failed:**
```
1. GE CAPITAL MASKED INDUSTRIAL WEAKNESS
   • Financial returns hid operational issues
   • Industrial businesses underinvested
   • 2008 exposed truth
   • Should have been separate earlier

2. COMPLEXITY EXCEEDED BENEFIT
   • Conglomerate overhead
   • Management attention spread thin
   • Best practices transfer declined
   • Bureaucracy increased

3. ACQUISITION DISCIPLINE ERODED
   • Pressure to deploy capital
   • "Financial engineering" mindset
   • Poor timing (Alstom, Baker Hughes)
   • Integration challenges

4. INTERNAL SUCCESSION FAILED
   • Culture of conformity
   • External perspective lacking
   • Immelt continued Welch playbook
   • Reality changed, strategy didn't

5. PARENTING VALUE DECLINED
   • "GE management" less distinctive
   • Other companies adopted practices
   • Talent development less unique
   • Parent overhead exceeded value-add
```

**Contrast with Successful Conglomerates:**
```
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY (works):
• Minimal corporate overhead
• Decentralized operations
• Exceptional capital allocation
• Long-term orientation
• Warren Buffett unique capability

DANAHER (works):
• Clear operational system (DBS)
• Focused portfolio (life sciences)
• Acquisition machine with discipline
• Integration expertise
• Measurable value-add

GE (failed):
• Large corporate structure
• Diverse portfolio (too diverse)
• GE Capital dependency
• Acquisition integration weak
• Parenting value eroded
```

### Discussion Questions

1. Was GE's decline inevitable, or could different leadership have saved the conglomerate?

2. Jack Welch is still admired despite GE's later problems. How much responsibility does he bear for what followed?

3. Should GE have broken up earlier? In 2001? 2008? What was the optimal timing?

4. Are there any businesses GE should have kept together? Was the three-way split the right structure?

5. Larry Culp came from Danaher, a successful conglomerate. What did he bring that internal GE leaders lacked?

### Epilogue: Life After GE

```
POST-BREAKUP PERFORMANCE (2023-2024):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GE Aerospace: Strong performance, aviation recovery
GE Healthcare: Solid growth, innovation pipeline
GE Vernova: Challenging transition, renewable focus

The focused companies are performing better than
the combined GE did. The market has validated
the breakup thesis.

LESSON:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sometimes the whole is worth less than the sum
of its parts. Corporate strategy must honestly
assess whether the parent adds value—or subtracts it.
```
