## Learning Objectives

- Understand why firm boundaries matter strategically
- Apply tests for diversification decisions
- Analyze economies of scope and their sources
- Evaluate corporate coherence and strategic fit
- Distinguish valid from invalid diversification rationales

## Introduction

What determines the boundaries of a firm? Why does Amazon sell cloud computing services while Walmart does not? Why did Disney acquire Pixar instead of simply contracting for animated films? The scope of the firm—which businesses it participates in—is perhaps the most fundamental corporate strategy question. Getting this right creates enormous value; getting it wrong destroys billions.

## The Fundamental Question

### Why Scope Matters

```
CORPORATE SCOPE DECISIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. HORIZONTAL SCOPE
   Which products and markets?
   • Product diversification
   • Geographic expansion
   • Customer segments

2. VERTICAL SCOPE
   Which activities in value chain?
   • Make vs. buy decisions
   • Forward/backward integration

3. GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE
   Which regions and countries?
   • Domestic vs. international
   • Global vs. multi-domestic

CONSEQUENCES OF SCOPE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Correct scope  →  Synergies, efficiency, growth
Wrong scope    →  Complexity, distraction, value destruction

Apple (focused): $3 trillion market cap
GE (diversified): $100 billion (after breakup)
```

### The Boundaries Puzzle

```
WHY DO FIRMS EXIST AT ALL?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ronald Coase (1937): "The Nature of the Firm"

Markets are efficient, so why firms?
Answer: Transaction costs

When market transactions are costly:
• Finding suppliers
• Negotiating contracts
• Monitoring performance
• Enforcing agreements

...it may be cheaper to "make" than "buy"

FIRM BOUNDARIES DETERMINED BY:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Transaction cost comparison
• Capability requirements
• Strategic considerations
• Market failures
```

## Tests for Corporate Strategy

### The Three Essential Tests

```
PORTER'S THREE TESTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. THE ATTRACTIVENESS TEST
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Is the target industry structurally attractive?
OR can you restructure it to become attractive?

Questions:
• What are the Five Forces?
• Is profitability above cost of capital?
• Can entry barriers be built?

Warning: Diversifying into unattractive industries
         rarely creates value

2. THE COST-OF-ENTRY TEST
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Can you enter at reasonable cost?

Entry costs often exceed value created:
• Acquisition premiums (30-50% typical)
• Greenfield investment time and risk
• Competitive response costs

Question: Does cost of entry exceed
          present value of future profits?

3. THE BETTER-OFF TEST (Most Important)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Will the business be better off as part of
your corporation than independent?

OR: Will your corporation be better off
    with this business?

Sources of being better-off:
• Shared activities
• Transferred skills
• Enhanced market power
• Access to capital

If NO to this test → Don't diversify
```

### The Better-Off Test in Detail

```
APPLYING THE BETTER-OFF TEST:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SYNERGIES MUST BE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. REAL (not imaginary)
   • Specific and identifiable
   • Quantifiable
   • Based on actual capabilities

2. ATTAINABLE (not just theoretical)
   • Organizational capability to capture
   • Management bandwidth exists
   • Not blocked by competition

3. SIGNIFICANT (not trivial)
   • Large enough to matter
   • Exceed integration costs
   • Sustainable over time

4. UNIQUE (better than alternatives)
   • You capture more than others would
   • Best owner of business
   • Parenting advantage exists

SYNERGY ASSESSMENT:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Claimed Synergy         Reality Check
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"Cross-selling"         How much, really?
"Shared R&D"           Are they compatible?
"Brand leverage"        Does brand transfer?
"Purchasing power"      Already at scale?
"Best practices"        Can buy consultants
"Cost savings"          Net of integration?
```

---

## Economies of Scope

### Understanding Scope Economics

```
ECONOMIES OF SCOPE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cost(A,B together) < Cost(A alone) + Cost(B alone)

Production of A makes B cheaper (or vice versa)

DIFFERENT FROM ECONOMIES OF SCALE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Scale: Cost/unit decreases with volume of ONE product
Scope: Cost decreases with variety of products

Both can exist simultaneously
```

### Sources of Scope Economies

```
1. SHARED INPUTS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Physical assets:
• Manufacturing facilities
• Distribution networks
• IT systems

Intangible assets:
• Brand reputation
• Customer relationships
• Technical knowledge
• Patents/IP

Example: Disney
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Same characters across movies, parks, merchandise
• Brand investment leveraged many ways
• Content created once, monetized repeatedly

2. SHARED ACTIVITIES
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Functions that serve multiple businesses:
• Shared sales force
• Common procurement
• Joint R&D
• Shared manufacturing

Example: Procter & Gamble
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Same retail relationships for all brands
• Shared consumer research
• Common manufacturing capabilities
• Joint advertising buying

3. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Skills and capabilities across businesses:
• Management expertise
• Technical know-how
• Best practices
• Process improvements

Example: Danaher
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Danaher Business System across all units
• Lean manufacturing expertise
• Kaizen culture
• Performance management
```

### Measuring Scope Economies

```
SCOPE ECONOMY QUANTIFICATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                 Combined    A Alone   B Alone
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Revenue           $200M       $100M     $100M
Costs            -$150M       -$80M     -$80M
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Profit            $50M        $20M      $20M

Scope benefit = $50M - ($20M + $20M) = $10M

SOURCES OF $10M:
• Shared distribution    $3M
• Combined purchasing    $2M
• Cross-selling         $3M
• Shared overhead       $2M
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total scope benefit     $10M
```

## Corporate Coherence

### What Makes a Corporation Coherent?

```
CORPORATE COHERENCE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Degree to which businesses in portfolio:
• Share strategic logic
• Leverage common capabilities
• Create value together
• Fit parenting model

HIGH COHERENCE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Apple:
• All products use same OS
• Same design philosophy
• Integrated ecosystem
• Common brand/customer

LOW COHERENCE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Old GE:
• Jet engines to NBC to insurance
• Little operational overlap
• Different customers
• Conglomerate "tax"
```

### Measuring Coherence

```
COHERENCE INDICATORS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Strong coherence:
• Businesses share customers (>30%)
• Businesses share technologies
• Businesses share capabilities
• Businesses share brand
• Movements between businesses common

Weak coherence:
• No customer overlap
• Different technologies
• Separate capability requirements
• Distinct brands
• Siloed operations

COHERENCE MATRIX:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
              Business A  Business B  Business C
Business A       -         Shared      Shared
                          customers   technology
Business B     Shared        -        Shared
              customers              brand
Business C     Shared      Shared       -
              technology   brand

High overlap → High coherence → More value
Low overlap  → Low coherence  → "Conglomerate discount"
```

## Valid vs. Invalid Diversification Rationales

### Valid Rationales

```
1. ECONOMIES OF SCOPE (Genuine)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Valid when:
• Shared resources are significant
• Integration costs are low
• Scale advantages real

Example: Amazon Web Services
• Built on e-commerce infrastructure
• Leveraged existing capabilities
• Created new profit pool

2. SUPERIOR PARENTING
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Valid when:
• Parent has unique capabilities
• Capabilities transfer to business
• Business needs that help

Example: Danaher acquisitions
• Danaher Business System proven
• Target businesses improve 2-3x
• Repeatable process

3. MARKET POWER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Valid when:
• Increased bargaining position
• Cross-subsidization enables competition
• Bundling creates value

Example: Microsoft Office + Teams
• Bundling leverages installed base
• Competitors disadvantaged
• Customer convenience
(Note: May raise antitrust concerns)

4. INTERNAL CAPITAL MARKETS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Valid when:
• External markets imperfect
• Information advantages exist
• Capital allocation skill superior

Example: Berkshire Hathaway
• Warren Buffett capital allocation
• Patient capital
• Operational independence
```

### Invalid Rationales

```
1. "DIVERSIFYING RISK"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
INVALID because:
• Shareholders can diversify themselves
• Cheaper to buy index fund
• No reason to pay management for this

"Diversification is for investors, not companies"

2. "GROWTH FOR GROWTH'S SAKE"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
INVALID because:
• Growth without value is destruction
• Empire building serves managers, not shareholders
• Acquisitions often destroy value

Warning sign: CEO focused on "size" or "scale"

3. "USING EXCESS CASH"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
INVALID because:
• Return cash to shareholders instead
• They can invest better
• Discipline of capital return

Better: Dividends or buybacks

4. "UNDEFINED SYNERGIES"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
INVALID because:
• "Synergy" without specifics = nothing
• Integration costs are real
• Hope is not strategy

Red flag: "Strategic fit" without detail
```

---

## The Conglomerate Question

### Do Conglomerates Add Value?

```
THE EVIDENCE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. CONGLOMERATE DISCOUNT
   • Diversified firms trade at 10-20% discount
   • Market says: "Focused is better"
   • Sum-of-parts > Whole

2. PERFORMANCE DATA
   • Related diversification outperforms unrelated
   • Focus often outperforms diversification
   • "Return to core" movements work

3. HISTORICAL TREND
   • 1960s-70s: Conglomerate boom
   • 1980s-90s: Bust and breakup
   • 2000s: Focused corporations favored
   • 2020s: Breakups continue (GE, J&J)
```

### When Conglomerates Work

```
CONGLOMERATES CAN WORK WHEN:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. CAPITAL ALLOCATION EXCELLENCE
   • Berkshire Hathaway model
   • Superior to external markets
   • Long-term orientation

2. EMERGING MARKET CONDITIONS
   • Weak external institutions
   • Internal markets more efficient
   • Business group advantages

3. TURNAROUND CAPABILITIES
   • Fix broken businesses
   • Danaher Business System
   • Operational expertise

4. GOVERNANCE EXCELLENCE
   • Better than public market scrutiny
   • Strong boards
   • Aligned incentives

REQUIRES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Exceptional management
• Clear operating model
• Discipline on exit
• Modest diversification
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Scope decisions are strategic** - They determine the fundamental nature of the corporation
2. **Three tests must be passed** - Attractiveness, cost-of-entry, better-off
3. **Better-off is paramount** - Without genuine synergies, don't diversify
4. **Economies of scope are specific** - Must be real, attainable, significant
5. **Coherence matters** - Related portfolios outperform unrelated
6. **Most rationales are invalid** - Risk diversification, growth, cash use
7. **Conglomerates typically underperform** - Except with exceptional capabilities
8. **Focus creates value** - Simpler is often better

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Better-Off Test
A packaged food company is considering acquiring a restaurant chain. Apply the three tests and identify specific synergies. Would you recommend the acquisition?

### Problem 2: Scope Economies
Calculate the scope economies for a consumer goods company that shares distribution, R&D, and marketing across three product categories. Quantify each source.

### Problem 3: Coherence Assessment
Assess the coherence of Amazon's portfolio (e-commerce, AWS, devices, entertainment). Is it more or less coherent than it appears?
