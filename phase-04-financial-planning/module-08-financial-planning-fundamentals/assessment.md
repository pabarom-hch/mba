## Answer Key

### Section 1: Financial Planning Process

**Answer 1.1 (5 points):**
1. Understanding the client's personal and financial circumstances
2. Identifying and selecting goals
3. Analyzing the current course of action and potential alternatives
4. Developing the financial planning recommendations
5. Presenting the financial planning recommendations
6. Implementing the financial planning recommendations
7. Monitoring progress and updating

(Deduct 0.5 points for each step out of order or incorrectly stated)

**Answer 1.2 (5 points):**
Step 7 is circular because financial planning is ongoing; life changes require revisiting and updating the plan (2 points).

Trigger events (1 point each, any three):
- Marriage, divorce, or death of spouse
- Birth or adoption of child
- Job change or income change
- Receipt of inheritance or windfall
- Significant market event affecting portfolio
- Health diagnosis
- Home purchase or sale
- Retirement or approaching retirement

**Answer 1.3 (5 points):**
Example SMART goal (1 point per element):
- Specific: "Accumulate $2 million in investable assets"
- Measurable: "$2 million"
- Achievable: Based on current savings capacity and time
- Relevant: Supports retirement security and financial independence
- Time-bound: "by age 60" or "within 15 years"

Sample: "I will accumulate $2 million in investable assets by age 60 through consistent annual savings of $50,000."

**Answer 1.4 (5 points):**
Quantitative data (2.5 points - definition + examples):
- Numerical, objective information
- Examples: Tax returns, account statements, net worth, income, expenses, insurance policy values

Qualitative data (2.5 points - definition + examples):
- Non-numerical, subjective information
- Examples: Risk tolerance, values and priorities, family dynamics, health concerns, career aspirations, attitudes about money

### Section 2: Personal Financial Statements

**Answer 2.1 (10 points):**

```
ASSETS
Liquid Assets:
  Checking:              $8,500
  Savings:              $35,000
  Total Liquid:         $43,500

Investment Assets:
  401(k):              $285,000
  Roth IRA:             $45,000
  Company Stock:       $120,000
  Total Investment:    $450,000

Personal Assets:
  Home:                $520,000
  Car:                  $28,000
  Total Personal:      $548,000

TOTAL ASSETS:        $1,041,500

LIABILITIES:
  Credit Cards:          $4,200
  Mortgage:            $380,000
  Auto Loan:            $22,000
TOTAL LIABILITIES:    $406,200

NET WORTH:            $635,300
```

(4 points for correct totals, 3 points for proper categorization, 3 points for net worth calculation)

**Answer 2.2 (8 points):**

a) Emergency Fund Ratio (2 points):
```
Liquid assets / Monthly expenses
$43,500 / $9,500 = 4.6 months
Assessment: Adequate (target 3-6 months) ✓
```

b) DTI Ratio (2 points):
```
Monthly debt payments / Gross monthly income
($2,400 + $450 + $85) / ($180,000/12)
$2,935 / $15,000 = 19.6%
Assessment: Good (target < 36%) ✓
```

c) Net Worth to Income (2 points):
```
Net worth / Annual income
$635,300 / $180,000 = 3.5x
Need to know age to assess, but if ~45-50, this is on track
(Age 45 target ≈ 3x, Age 50 target ≈ 4x)
```

d) Assessment summary (2 points):
All ratios appear healthy. Emergency fund is adequate but could be higher (6 months recommended for security). DTI is well within limits. Net worth on track for age 45-50.

**Answer 2.3 (7 points):**

Company stock percentage (3 points):
- % of total assets: $120,000 / $1,041,500 = 11.5%
- % of investment assets: $120,000 / $450,000 = 26.7%

Concern assessment (2 points):
- 11.5% of total assets is moderate but manageable
- 26.7% of investment assets is concerning
- Combined with career tied to same company = concentrated risk

Recommendations (2 points):
- Reduce to 10-15% of investment assets over 2-3 years
- Diversify into broad market index funds
- Consider 10b5-1 plan for systematic selling
- Stop acquiring additional company stock in 401(k)

### Section 3: Cash Flow Management

**Answer 3.1 (8 points):**

Standard 50/30/20 (4 points):
- Needs (50%): $7,500
- Wants (30%): $4,500
- Savings (20%): $3,000

High-earner modification (4 points):
- Needs (40%): $6,000
- Wants (25%): $3,750
- Savings (35%): $5,250

Rationale: High earners can meet needs with lower percentage; should save higher percentage for tax efficiency, earlier financial independence, and because marginal lifestyle improvement diminishes.

**Answer 3.2 (6 points):**

Automation system:
1. **Paycheck split** (1.5 points): Direct deposit 25% to savings/investment account, 75% to operating

2. **Bill automation** (1.5 points): All fixed bills on auto-pay from operating account, scheduled in first 5 days after payday

3. **Bonus handling** (1.5 points): 50% automatically to investment account, 30% to tax set-aside, 20% discretionary

4. **Discretionary control** (1.5 points): Weekly allowance transfer to separate "fun" account; when empty, no more discretionary spending that week

**Answer 3.3 (6 points):**

Diagnosis (2 points):
- Lifestyle inflation: Expenses rising with income
- Savings rate declining despite income growth
- Likely status-driven spending or lack of automated savings

Interventions (4 points - any three):
1. **50% raise rule**: Future raises go 50% to savings, 50% to lifestyle
2. **Automate first**: Set up automatic transfer of 15% additional before lifestyle can access
3. **Subscription audit**: Review all recurring expenses, eliminate unused
4. **Separate accounts**: Put savings where it's invisible
5. **Set specific goal**: "Save $X for Y purpose" more motivating than general savings
6. **Expense tracking**: 30-day log to create awareness

### Section 4: Emergency & Debt Planning

**Answer 4.1 (6 points):**

Calculation (3 points):
- Essential expenses: $7,500/month
- Months needed: 9-12 months
- Target: $67,500 - $90,000

Reasoning (3 points):
- Single income: Base of 6 months
- Specialized/senior career: +2-3 months (longer job search)
- Two dependents: +1-2 months (higher stakes)
- Total: 9-12 months appropriate

**Answer 4.2 (8 points):**

a) Avalanche method (2 points):
1. Credit Card A ($6,500 @ 22%) - highest rate
2. Credit Card B ($2,200 @ 18%)
3. Car Loan ($18,000 @ 5%)
4. Student Loan ($35,000 @ 4.5%) - lowest rate

b) Snowball method (2 points):
1. Credit Card B ($2,200) - smallest balance
2. Credit Card A ($6,500)
3. Car Loan ($18,000)
4. Student Loan ($35,000) - largest balance

c) Recommendation (4 points):
Recommend **hybrid approach**:
- Pay CC B first (quick win in ~3 months with $600 extra)
- Then switch to avalanche and pay CC A
- Psychological boost of early win, then mathematical optimization

Alternatively, pure avalanche if client is analytically-minded and doesn't need motivation boost.

**Answer 4.3 (6 points):**

Analysis (4 points):
```
Transfer fee: $8,700 × 3% = $261

Without transfer (15 months):
Interest on CC A: ~$1,400
Interest on CC B: ~$380
Total interest: ~$1,780

With transfer:
$700/month × 15 = $10,500 payable
$8,700 + $261 = $8,961 total debt
Yes, paid off before promo ends
Savings: ~$1,780 - $261 = ~$1,519
```

Recommendation (2 points):
Yes, worthwhile. Save approximately $1,500 in interest. Important: Must pay off during promo period and not accumulate new debt.

### Section 5: Behavioral Finance

**Answer 5.1 (6 points):**

a) Anchoring (2 points): Fixated on purchase price as reference point, which is irrelevant to current decision

b) Confirmation bias (2 points): Seeking information that confirms belief while ignoring contradicting evidence

c) Endowment effect (2 points): Overvaluing asset because of ownership and emotional attachment

**Answer 5.2 (5 points):**

Three system-based interventions (1.67 points each):

1. **Written investment policy statement**: Pre-commit to strategy during calm times; refer to during volatility

2. **Automatic rebalancing**: Set up automatic quarterly rebalancing; removes timing decision

3. **Email/news blackout during downturns**: Unsubscribe from financial news; reduce emotional triggers

4. **Advisor veto power**: Give advisor authority to block panic trades; require 48-hour cooling period

5. **Separate checking account**: Keep monthly expenses in cash; can't see portfolio daily

(Any three well-explained interventions acceptable)

**Answer 5.3 (4 points):**

Loss aversion definition (2 points):
Losses hurt approximately twice as much as equivalent gains feel good. $100 loss feels like $200 in negative utility.

Dual effect (2 points):
- **Holding losers**: Selling realizes the loss, making it "real." Holding maintains hope of recovery. The pain of admitting loss > rational acceptance.
- **Selling winners**: Lock in the gain to feel the positive emotion. Fear of giving back the gain > patience for further appreciation.

Result: "Disposition effect" - investors sell winners too early and hold losers too long.
