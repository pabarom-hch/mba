## Core Concepts

### The Debt Spectrum

```
PRODUCTIVE DEBT                    DESTRUCTIVE DEBT
(Asset-building)                   (Consumption)
←───────────────────────────────────────────────→

Examples:                          Examples:
- Mortgage                         - Credit cards
- Student loans (ROI positive)     - Payday loans
- Business loans                   - Car title loans
- Investment leverage              - Consumer finance
- Real estate investment           - Financed lifestyle

Key Distinction:
Does the debt fund something that
appreciates or generates income?
```

### Types of Debt

**Secured Debt:**
```
Backed by collateral that can be repossessed

Examples:
- Mortgages (home)
- Auto loans (vehicle)
- HELOCs (home)
- Secured credit cards (deposit)

Characteristics:
- Lower interest rates
- Longer terms available
- Default = lose asset
```

**Unsecured Debt:**
```
No collateral backing

Examples:
- Credit cards
- Personal loans
- Medical debt
- Student loans

Characteristics:
- Higher interest rates
- Shorter terms
- Default = credit damage, collections
```

### Interest Rate Analysis

```
Current Rate Environment (Example):

Debt Type          | Typical Rate | Tax Deductible?
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
Mortgage           | 6-7%         | Often (up to $750K)
HELOC              | 8-9%         | Sometimes
Auto loan          | 5-8%         | No
Student loan       | 5-8%         | Interest up to $2,500
Personal loan      | 10-15%       | No
Credit card        | 20-25%       | No
Payday loan        | 300-400%     | No

After-Tax Cost (25% bracket):
Mortgage at 7%: Effective ~5.25%
Credit card at 24%: Effective 24%
```

## Debt Payoff Strategies

### The Debt Avalanche (Mathematically Optimal)

```
Method: Pay highest interest rate first

Steps:
1. List all debts by interest rate (high to low)
2. Make minimum payments on all
3. Put extra toward highest rate debt
4. When paid, roll payment to next highest
5. Repeat until debt-free

Example:
Debt A: $5,000 @ 24% (pay first)
Debt B: $8,000 @ 18% (pay second)
Debt C: $15,000 @ 6% (pay last)

Advantage: Minimizes total interest paid
Disadvantage: May take longer for first win
```

### The Debt Snowball (Psychologically Effective)

```
Method: Pay smallest balance first

Steps:
1. List all debts by balance (low to high)
2. Make minimum payments on all
3. Put extra toward smallest balance
4. When paid, roll payment to next smallest
5. Repeat until debt-free

Example:
Debt A: $1,500 @ 18% (pay first)
Debt B: $5,000 @ 24% (pay second)
Debt C: $15,000 @ 6% (pay last)

Advantage: Quick wins build momentum
Disadvantage: May pay more interest
```

### Comparison

```
Scenario:
Total debt: $25,000
Monthly payment available: $800

          Avalanche    Snowball
──────────────────────────────────
Time to payoff:  32 months   34 months
Total interest:  $4,200      $4,800
First debt paid: Month 12    Month 4

Choose Based On:
- Avalanche: Analytical, motivated by math
- Snowball: Need wins, struggling with motivation
- Hybrid: Quick win first, then avalanche
```

### The Hybrid Approach

```
1. Pay off smallest debt first (quick win)
2. Then switch to avalanche (highest rate)
3. Best of both worlds

Psychology:
- Initial win builds confidence
- Then optimize for interest savings
```

## Debt Optimization Strategies

### Balance Transfer

```
Move high-interest debt to lower-rate card

Terms to Evaluate:
- Transfer fee: 3-5% typical
- Promotional rate: 0% for 12-21 months
- Regular rate: What happens after promo?

Break-Even Analysis:
Current card: $10,000 @ 24%
Transfer card: 3% fee, 0% for 18 months
Fee: $300
Interest savings: $10,000 × 24% × 1.5 years = $3,600
Net savings: $3,300

Rule: Worth it if you'll pay off during promo
```

### Debt Consolidation

```
Combine multiple debts into single loan

Options:
- Personal loan
- HELOC
- 401(k) loan (generally avoid)

Evaluation:
✓ Lower weighted average rate
✓ Simplified payments
✓ Fixed payoff timeline
✗ Don't extend term unnecessarily
✗ Don't free up credit to accumulate more debt
```

### Refinancing

```
Replace existing loan with new terms

When to Refinance:
- Interest rate drop: 1%+ savings
- Improved credit: Better rate available
- Changed circumstances: Need different terms

Examples:
- Mortgage refinance (save $200/month)
- Student loan refinance (5.5% → 4%)
- Auto refinance (rarely worthwhile)

Calculate:
Closing costs ÷ Monthly savings = Break-even months
If keeping loan longer, refinance
```

## Special Debt Situations

### Student Loans

```
Federal Student Loans:
- Income-driven repayment options
- Public Service Loan Forgiveness
- Deferment/forbearance options
- Don't refinance to private (lose protections)

Private Student Loans:
- Fixed vs. variable rates
- Refinancing often beneficial
- No forgiveness programs

Strategy:
1. Stay federal if using protections
2. Refinance if high income, stable job
3. Consider employer repayment programs
```

### Mortgage Optimization

```
Extra Payment Strategies:
- Bi-weekly payments: Adds 1 payment/year
- Round up: $1,847 → $1,900
- Annual lump sum: Tax refund/bonus

Impact Example (30-year $400K @ 7%):
Monthly payment: $2,661
Extra $200/month:
- Saves: $127,000 interest
- Payoff: 6 years earlier

Consider Instead:
- If rate < expected investment return
- Invest difference
- Maintain liquidity
```

### When to Pay Off vs. Invest

```
Decision Framework:

Pay off debt if:
- Interest rate > expected investment return
- Guaranteed "return" on payoff
- Psychological benefit high
- Need to reduce DTI
- Rate is variable/rising

Invest if:
- Interest rate < expected investment return
- Tax advantages (401k match, Roth)
- Rate is fixed and low
- Comfortable with debt
- Long time horizon

Example:
Mortgage at 4% vs. 401(k) with 100% match
→ Always take the match first
→ Guaranteed 100% return > 4% cost
```

## CEO/Executive Debt Considerations

### Strategic Use of Debt

```
Executive Leverage Opportunities:

Securities-Based Lending:
- Borrow against portfolio
- Rates: Prime - 1% to Prime
- No sale = no capital gains
- Use for: Bridge loans, opportunities

Pledged Asset Lines:
- Similar to SBL
- Portfolio remains invested
- Flexibility and low cost

Home Equity:
- HELOC for liquidity
- Tax-deductible interest (if qualified)
- Lower rate than unsecured
```

### Concentrated Stock and Debt

```
Situation: Large company stock position

Risky Approach:
- Borrow against stock
- Stock drops
- Margin call
- Forced sale at low prices

Safer Approach:
- Diversify systematically
- Use proceeds for financial needs
- Maintain separate emergency fund
- Don't over-leverage
```

### Deferred Compensation and Debt

```
Consideration:
Deferred comp is unsecured creditor claim
If company fails, you may lose both:
- Your deferred compensation
- Your job

Implication:
- Don't count on deferred comp for debt payoff
- Maintain liquidity independent of company
- Consider risk when making elections
```

## Worked Example

### Debt Payoff Plan

**Current Debt Situation:**

| Debt | Balance | Rate | Minimum | Type |
|------|---------|------|---------|------|
| Credit Card A | $8,500 | 24% | $170 | Consumer |
| Credit Card B | $3,200 | 18% | $64 | Consumer |
| Car Loan | $15,000 | 6% | $375 | Secured |
| Student Loans | $25,000 | 5% | $280 | Federal |
| Mortgage | $280,000 | 7% | $1,864 | Secured |

**Analysis:**

```
Total Consumer Debt: $11,700 (priority)
Total Non-Mortgage: $51,700
Monthly Minimums: $2,753

Available for Debt: $3,500/month
Extra Available: $747/month

Recommended: Hybrid Approach

Step 1: Pay Credit Card B first ($3,200)
- Quick win in ~5 months
- Roll minimum to Card A

Step 2: Pay Credit Card A ($8,500)
- Higher rate, second priority
- Paid in ~10 months after Card B

Step 3: Evaluate car vs. student loans
- Car: 6%, secured
- Student: 5%, tax-deductible interest
- Mathematically: Car first
- But student loans lower total interest

Step 4: Extra mortgage payments optional
- Rate is moderate
- May prefer investing
```

**Projected Timeline:**

```
Month 0: Start
Month 5: Card B paid ($3,200)
Month 15: Card A paid ($8,500)
Month 35: Car paid ($15,000)
Month 65: Student loans paid ($25,000)

Total non-mortgage debt freedom: ~5.5 years
Interest saved vs. minimums: $8,400
```

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Payoff Strategy
Debts: Card A ($2,000 @ 22%), Card B ($7,000 @ 19%), Personal loan ($5,000 @ 12%). Extra $500/month. Calculate payoff order and timeline for avalanche vs. snowball.

### Problem 2: Refinance Decision
Mortgage: $300K at 7%, 25 years remaining. Refinance to 5.5%, costs $6,000. Monthly savings: $280. Should you refinance?

### Problem 3: Invest vs. Pay Debt
Student loan: $30K at 5%. Expected market return: 7%. 401(k) match: 50% up to 6% of salary. Salary: $100K. Prioritize $15K annual savings capacity.
