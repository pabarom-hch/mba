Robert's Options: $1,400,000
TechVenture is Series C startup
If company fails: Options worth $0
Company stock = 29% of investment assets
Company income = 50%+ of household
Total company exposure: Very High
```

### Income Volatility

```
Robert's bonus: $0 - $350K range possible
Catherine's distribution: $150K - $250K range

Combined variable income: $300K - $600K
Lifestyle expenses based on high end
```

### Liability Structure

```
HELOC at 8.5%: Growing (now $85K)
Used for: Renovations, vacation, taxes

```

## Exhibit 5: Investment Allocation

### Current Portfolio (Excluding Options and Real Estate)

**Retirement Accounts ($1,540,000):**

| Account | Value | Allocation |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Robert's 401(k) | $520,000 | 70% stock, 20% bond, 10% company stock |
| Catherine's Profit-Sharing | $680,000 | Target-date 2045 fund |
| Catherine's Deferred Comp | $340,000 | 60% stock, 40% bond |

**Taxable ($280,000):**
- Individual stocks: 40% (concentrated in tech)
- Bond funds: 30%
- Cash/MM: 30%

**529 Plans ($147,000):**
- Age-based allocation (appropriate)

3. Deferred comp at credit risk of employer
4. Options highly illiquid until liquidity event
```

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives
This case teaches students to:
- Apply comprehensive financial assessment
- Identify hidden issues in high-earner situations
- Prioritize competing goals with limited resources
- Develop integrated recommendations

### Key Insights

**Lifestyle Inflation:**
Despite $980K income, only 12.7% savings rate. HELOC growth suggests actual savings may be negative. High discretionary spending ($131K) and taxes ($300K) consume most income.

**Concentration Risk:**
- TechVenture exposure: 50%+ of income, 29% of investment assets
- If company fails or Robert leaves: Devastating impact
- Options illiquid and may never vest/become valuable

**False Security:**
- Net worth of $4.8M looks strong
- But $1.4M in illiquid options (maybe worthless)
- $2.25M in real estate (not investable)
- True liquid investment wealth: ~$1.7M

**Goal Conflicts:**
- Retirement at 60 requires >$4M investable
- College costs: $700K over next decade
- Lifestyle maintenance conflicts with both
- Cannot achieve all goals without changes

### Model Solution Highlights

**Financial Ratios:**
```
Emergency Fund: $110K / $30K monthly = 3.7 months
  Assessment: Below target (6 months recommended)

DTI: ($4,583 + $2,167 + $708 + $450) / $81,667 = 9.7%
  Assessment: Low (good)

Savings Rate: $124,500 / $980,000 = 12.7%
  Assessment: Below target (20% minimum for early retirement)

Net Worth/Income: $4.835M / $980K = 4.9x
  Assessment: Good for age 46-47, but includes illiquid assets
```

**Goal Feasibility:**
```
Retirement at 60 (13 years):
  Need: $4.5M investable (3% withdrawal, inflation-adjusted)
  Current investable: ~$1.7M
  Annual savings needed: ~$150K at 6% return
  Current savings: $125K
  Gap: $25K/year + must reduce spending in retirement

College Funding:
  Total need: $700K
  Current 529: $147K
  Gap: $553K
  Annual need: ~$55K/year for next 10 years
  Current 529 savings: $24K
  Gap: $31K/year additional

Cannot fund both fully at current savings rate.
```

**Priority Recommendations:**
```
1. IMMEDIATE (Month 1-3):
   - Stop HELOC usage; pay minimum + $1,000/month
   - Increase life insurance (Robert to $2M term)
   - Add supplemental disability

2. SHORT-TERM (Month 4-12):
   - Reduce discretionary spending by $40K/year
   - Redirect to 529 and taxable savings
   - If TechVenture has liquidity, sell 25% of options

3. MEDIUM-TERM (Year 2-3):
   - Consider selling vacation home (frees $170K equity)
   - Diversify TechVenture position aggressively
   - Build emergency fund to 6 months

4. GOAL ADJUSTMENT:
   - Retirement at 62 vs. 60 (adds $200K+ to assets)
   - Catherine continues consulting (adds income)
   - State school option for college (reduces cost)
```

### Discussion Questions

1. How do you help clients accept that their goals may be unrealistic?

2. Should the Torres family sell the vacation home? How do you weigh emotional vs. financial factors?

3. What if TechVenture goes public and the options are worth $3M? How does that change the plan?

4. How would you address the disconnect between high income and financial stress?
