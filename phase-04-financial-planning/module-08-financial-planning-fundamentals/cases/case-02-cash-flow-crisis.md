# Case Study: The High-Earner Cash Flow Crisis

## Executive Summary

Dr. Michael Okonkwo is a 52-year-old cardiothoracic surgeon earning $750,000 annually. Despite his high income, he lives paycheck to paycheck, carries significant debt, has minimal retirement savings, and recently received a margin call on his brokerage account. He's come to you in crisis, seeking help to understand how he ended up here and what to do about it.

**Key Question:** How did a high earner end up in financial distress, and what's the path forward?

## Exhibit 3: How Did This Happen?

### The Timeline

```
Years 1-8 (Age 40-48): Building Phase
- Income ramping from $400K to $700K
- First marriage, two kids, normal expenses
- Some savings, some lifestyle
- No real financial planning
- "We'll catch up later"

Years 9-12 (Age 48-52): Crisis Phase
- Divorce #1: $800K settlement, ongoing support
- Lifestyle inflation: Bigger house, cars, club
- Marriage #2: Combined households, new spending
- Market timing: Bought stocks on margin in 2021
- 2022 crash: Margin call, forced selling
- Divorce #2: Legal fees mounting
- Denial: "Income will cover it"
```

### Contributing Behavioral Patterns

```
1. Income-Based Security
   "I make $750K, I can afford anything"
   → Never calculated if actually true

2. Status Spending
   Surgeon peers have similar lifestyles
   → Comparison-driven decisions

3. Avoidance
   Never looked at full picture
   → "I'm too busy saving lives"

4. Delegation Without Oversight
   Let spouses handle finances
   → No visibility or control

5. Overconfidence
   Picked stocks himself (margin)
   → Lost $140K in one year
```

## Exhibit 4: The Margin Call Crisis

### What Happened

```
2021:
- Brokerage value: $450,000
- Borrowed on margin: $180,000 (40% margin)
- Total position: $630,000
- Strategy: "Tech stocks always go up"

2022:
- Market declined 25%
- Portfolio dropped to: $472,500
- Margin call triggered at 50%
- Had to sell $140,000 in positions at losses
- Tax losses realized: $75,000

Current:
- Portfolio value: $180,000
- Margin balance: $95,000 (53% margin!)
- Still at risk if market drops further
- Paying 9.5% on margin loan
```

### Immediate Risk

```
If market drops 10%:
- Portfolio: $162,000
- Margin: $95,000 (59%)
- Another margin call likely

If forced to sell everything:
- Realizes capital losses
- Still owes $95K
- Creates liquidity crisis
```

## Exhibit 5: Pending Issues

### Second Divorce Settlement (In Progress)

```
Likely Terms:
- Split of marital assets (~$200K to ex)
- Legal fees: $80K each side
- Temporary support: Unknown
- Timeline: 6-12 months
```

### Practice Considerations

```
Partnership Requirements:
- Must maintain capital account: $200K
- Distributions variable with practice performance
- Can't easily exit or reduce partnership

Malpractice Insurance:
- $8,000/year (not in monthly budget)
- Critical to maintain
```

### Tax Situation

```
Last Year:
- Underpaid estimated taxes
- Owes $45,000 additional
- Penalty: ~$2,000

This Year:
- No estimated payments made yet
- Will owe large amount
```

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives
This case demonstrates:
- High income does not guarantee financial security
- Behavioral patterns that lead to financial distress
- Crisis management and triage principles
- Long-term recovery planning

### Key Insights

**The Math Doesn't Work:**
```
Income: $750,000
Taxes: $240,000
Available: $510,000

Current spending: $605,000+ (excluding savings)
Deficit: $95,000+/year
Funded by: Credit cards, margin, depleting savings
```

**Why High Earners Fail:**
1. No budget (income assumption)
2. Lifestyle inflation (peer comparison)
3. Complexity (multiple marriages, properties)
4. Professional success ≠ financial literacy
5. No oversight or accountability

**Liquidation Reality:**
```
Stated Net Worth: $1,540,000

Adjusted for Reality:
- Brokerage after margin: $85,000
- Practice equity: Illiquid ($0 if leaving)
- Vehicles forced sale: $150,000
- Boat forced sale: $60,000
- Watches forced sale: $80,000
- Real estate (6% commission): Net ~$460,000

Realistic liquid net worth: Under $1M
With divorce settlement: ~$700K
```

### Model Solution Framework

**30-Day Emergency Plan:**
```
Week 1:
- Pay off margin loan (sell $95K from brokerage)
- Set up separate checking (all income to new account)
- Get visibility on all accounts

Week 2:
- Stop all discretionary spending
- Cancel boat slip, consider listing boat
- Contact divorce attorney re: expediting

Week 3:
- List condo for sale
- Get appraisals on vehicles
- Meet with accountant on tax situation

Week 4:
- Implement bare-bones budget
- Set up automatic tax payments
- Meet with financial advisor (fee-only)
```

**Asset Liquidation Priority:**
```
1. Pay margin loan ($95K) - Immediate
2. Sell boat ($85K) - 60 days
3. Sell condo ($650K less $420K mortgage = $230K) - 90 days
4. Sell one vehicle ($70K) - 60 days
5. Sell watch collection ($100K realized) - 90 days

Total liquidity generated: ~$580K
Use for: Debt payoff, divorce settlement, emergency fund
```

**Sustainable Budget at $750K:**
```
Income:                    $750,000
Taxes (32%):              ($240,000)
Net:                       $510,000

Essential Living:
  Housing (one home):      ($120,000)
  Transportation:           ($24,000)
  Insurance/Medical:        ($18,000)
  Child support/alimony:   ($102,000)
  Current child:            ($24,000)
  Basic lifestyle:          ($48,000)
Subtotal:                 ($336,000)

Savings (minimum 20%):    ($150,000)
  401(k)/profit sharing:    ($70,000)
  Taxable:                  ($80,000)

Discretionary:              $24,000

This requires cutting $270,000+ from current spending.
```

**Retirement Recovery:**
```
Current age: 52
Target retirement: 65 (13 years)
Current retirement savings: $420,000

Need at 65 (25x $200K spending): $5,000,000
Current: $420,000
Gap: $4,580,000

Required annual savings:
At 7% return: ~$230,000/year
At 6% return: ~$260,000/year

Challenging but achievable if:
- Saves $150K/year
- Works until 67-68
- Reduces retirement spending expectations
- Sells assets to boost starting position
```

### Discussion Questions

1. What responsibility do employers/practices have for financial wellness of high-earning professionals?

2. How do you have a productive conversation with someone in denial about their financial situation?

3. Is there a "right" amount of lifestyle for a $750K earner? How do you determine it?

4. What professional support structure should Dr. Okonkwo have? (Advisor, accountant, attorney, therapist?)

### Behavioral Interventions

```
Prevent Recurrence:
1. No margin accounts (ever)
2. Automatic savings before visible
3. Monthly net worth tracking
4. Quarterly advisor meetings
5. Spending allowance in separate account
6. No major purchases without 30-day wait
7. Joint decision-making with advisor for >$10K
8. Annual comprehensive review
```
