## Introduction

Just as corporations use financial statements to assess performance, individuals need personal financial statements to understand their financial position. These statements form the foundation of all financial planning—you cannot chart a course without knowing your starting point.

For executives, personal financial statements often reveal hidden complexity, concentration risk, and optimization opportunities that casual review misses.

## Financial Ratios

### Liquidity Ratios

**Emergency Fund Ratio:**
```
Emergency Fund Ratio = Liquid Assets / Monthly Expenses

Target: 3-6 months (6-12 for variable income)

Example:
Liquid assets: $30,000
Monthly expenses: $8,000
Ratio: 3.75 months

Interpretation:
< 3 months: Inadequate
3-6 months: Acceptable
6+ months: Strong
```

**Current Ratio:**
```
Current Ratio = Liquid Assets / Current Liabilities

Target: > 1.0

Example:
Liquid assets: $30,000
Credit cards + short-term debt: $5,000
Ratio: 6.0

Interpretation: Strong liquidity
```

### Debt Ratios

**Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:**
```
DTI = Monthly Debt Payments / Gross Monthly Income

Target: < 36%

Debt Payments Include:
- Mortgage (PITI)
- Car loans
- Student loans
- Minimum credit card payments

Example:
Monthly debt payments: $4,000
Gross monthly income: $15,000
DTI: 26.7%

Interpretation: Healthy
```

**Housing Expense Ratio (Front-End):**
```
Housing Ratio = Housing Expenses / Gross Monthly Income

Target: < 28%

Housing Expenses:
- Principal and interest
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- HOA (if applicable)

Example:
Housing expenses: $3,500
Gross income: $15,000
Ratio: 23.3%

Interpretation: Within guidelines
```

### Savings and Wealth Ratios

**Savings Rate:**
```
Savings Rate = Annual Savings / Gross Annual Income

Target: 15-20% (25%+ for accelerated)

Savings Include:
- 401(k) contributions
- IRA contributions
- Taxable investment contributions
- Debt principal (excess) payments

Example:
Annual savings: $45,000
Gross income: $200,000
Rate: 22.5%

Interpretation: Excellent
```

**Net Worth to Income:**
```
NW Ratio = Net Worth / Annual Income

Target by Age:
Age 30: 0.5x
Age 40: 2.0x
Age 50: 4.0x
Age 60: 6.0x
Age 65: 8.0x

Example (Age 50):
Net worth: $1,500,000
Annual income: $300,000
Ratio: 5.0x

Interpretation: Above target
```

### Asset Allocation Ratio

**Investment Assets Ratio:**
```
Investment Ratio = Investment Assets / Total Assets

Target: 60-80% (excluding primary residence)

Interpretation:
Low ratio: Too much in personal use assets
High ratio: Well-positioned for growth
```
