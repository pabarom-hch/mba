## Introduction

Alternative investments encompass asset classes beyond traditional stocks, bonds, and cash. They include private equity, hedge funds, real estate, infrastructure, and other less liquid investments. For sophisticated investors, alternatives can provide diversification, return enhancement, and access to strategies unavailable in public markets. However, they come with complexity, illiquidity, and higher fees that require careful evaluation.

## Core Concepts

## Private Equity

### Private Equity Overview

```
Definition:
Ownership of companies not traded on public exchanges

Strategy Types:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Buyouts (LBOs):
• Acquire mature companies using leverage
• Improve operations, grow revenue
• Exit via sale or IPO (3-7 years)
• Target: 2-3x return on equity

Growth Equity:
• Minority stakes in growing companies
• Less leverage than buyouts
• Provide capital for expansion
• Target: 2-3x return

Venture Capital:
• Early-stage company investment
• High failure rate, huge winners
• Seed, Series A, B, C, etc.
• Target: 3-10x+ for winners
```

### Private Equity Economics

```
J-Curve Effect:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Years 1-3: Negative returns
• Capital called but not yet invested
• Management fees charged
• Investments marked at cost

Years 4-7: Returns improve
• Portfolio companies mature
• Exits begin (IPO, sale)
• Distributions to investors

Years 7-10: Harvest period
• Remaining exits
• Final distributions
• Fund winds down

```

### Private Equity Fee Structure

```
Standard Fee Structure ("2 and 20"):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Management Fee: 2% of committed capital
• Paid annually
• Covers fund operations
• May step down after investment period

Carried Interest: 20% of profits
• Above preferred return (8% typically)
• Incentive for GP
• Paid after LPs receive capital back

Hurdle/Preferred Return:
• LP receives first 8% return
• Then catch-up to GP
• Then 80/20 split

Example ($1M commitment):
Capital invested: $1M
Exit proceeds: $2.5M
Gross return: 150%

LP receives: $1M + 8% preferred
Catch-up to GP
Then 80% of remaining profits
Net to LP: ~$2M (2x, after fees)
```

### Due Diligence for PE

```
Key Evaluation Criteria:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Track Record:
• Realized returns (not just IRR)
• Multiple of invested capital (MOIC)
• Consistency across funds
• Attribution to specific investments

Team:
• Experience and stability
• Sector expertise
• Value creation capability
• Alignment (GP commitment)

Strategy:
• Differentiated approach
• Sustainable competitive advantage
• Market opportunity
• Deal sourcing edge

Terms:
• Fee structure reasonableness
• Alignment mechanisms
• Clawback provisions
• Key-person clauses
```

## Venture Capital

### Venture Capital Overview

```
Stages of Investment:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Seed Stage:
• Pre-revenue or minimal revenue
• Concept/prototype stage
• Check size: $500K - $2M
• Failure rate: Very high (80%+)

Series A:
• Product-market fit emerging
• Early revenue
• Check size: $5M - $15M
• Building go-to-market

Series B/C:
• Scaling rapidly
• Proven business model
• Check size: $20M - $100M+
• Path to profitability or IPO

Late Stage/Growth:
• Pre-IPO companies
• Established businesses
• Lower risk, lower return
• Often includes PE-style investors
```

### Power Law Returns

```
VC Portfolio Distribution:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Typical fund of 20-30 investments:

Failures (30-40%):     → Return: 0x
Modest returns (30%):  → Return: 1-2x
Good returns (15-20%): → Return: 2-5x
Home runs (5-10%):     → Return: 10-100x+

Fund Returns Driven By:
• 1-2 companies drive 50%+ of returns
• Most investments fail
• Must own the "winners"

Implication:
• Diversification across stages/sectors
• Access to top-tier funds critical
• Power law, not normal distribution
```

### VC Investment Considerations

```
Challenges:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Very long time horizon (10-12 years)
• Highly illiquid
• J-curve pronounced
• Access to top funds is limited
• Dispersion between top and bottom quartile huge

Access Vehicles:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Direct Fund Investment:
• $1-5M+ minimums
• Accredited investor status required
• Access to top funds difficult

Fund-of-Funds:
• Diversification across managers
• Lower minimums ($250K-$500K)
• Additional fee layer
• Access to funds otherwise unavailable

Secondary Funds:
• Buy existing LP interests
• Reduced J-curve
• Diversified vintage years
• Growing market

Evergreen/Listed Vehicles:
• Public companies (ARCC, BX)
• Limited partnership shares (if listed)
• More liquid but different exposure
```

   • Do you have sufficient liquid reserves?
   • What are your known spending needs?

2. Access
   • Do you meet minimums ($250K-$1M+)?
   • Can you access top-tier managers?
   • Fund-of-funds appropriate?

3. Complexity
   • Do you understand the strategy?
   • Can you evaluate managers?
   • Tax complexity tolerable?

4. Fees
   • Are fees justified by returns?
   • Net-of-fee returns still attractive?
   • Additional layers (FOF fees)?

5. Portfolio Fit
   • What role does alternative serve?
   • Does it diversify existing holdings?
   • Does it match risk tolerance?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Alternatives are tools, not magic** - Use for specific portfolio needs
2. **Access matters enormously** - Top vs. bottom quartile differs drastically
3. **Fees are high** - Must be justified by net returns
4. **Illiquidity is real** - Plan for capital to be locked up
5. **Due diligence is essential** - Operational failures sink funds
6. **Understand what you own** - Complexity can hide risk
7. **Start small** - Build experience before large allocations
8. **Fit to portfolio** - Alternatives should complement, not dominate

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: PE Analysis
Fund targets 2.5x MOIC over 5 years with 2% management fee and 20% carry over 8% preferred. Calculate approximate net return.

### Problem 2: Allocation Decision
Client has $5M liquid, 15-year horizon, moderate risk tolerance. Design alternatives allocation with rationale.

### Problem 3: Fund-of-Funds Fees
PE fund returns 18% gross. FOF charges 1%/5%. Underlying funds charge 2%/20% over 8% hurdle. Estimate net return.
