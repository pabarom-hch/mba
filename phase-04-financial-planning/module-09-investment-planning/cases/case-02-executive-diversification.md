## Background

### Personal Information

- **Name:** Kevin Park
- **Age:** 47
- **Family:** Married to Lisa (45), two children (15 and 12)
- **Education:** MS Computer Science, Stanford
- **Position:** VP Engineering, TechVista Inc. (8 years at company)

### Career History

Kevin joined TechVista when it was a 200-person startup. He has been instrumental in building the engineering organization to 2,000+ people. His early equity grants have made him wealthy, but his wealth is almost entirely tied to TechVista stock.

```
TechVista History:
2016: Kevin joins, stock price $12
2018: IPO at $35
2020: Peak of $125 during pandemic
2022: Dropped to $45 (market correction)
2024: Current price $78
```

### Emotional Context

Kevin's relationship with TechVista stock is deeply emotional:

- "This stock made me wealthy—I was an engineer making $150K before this"
- "I know the company better than any analyst"
- "We're working on things that will transform the industry"
- "I feel like I'd be betraying the team if I sold"
- "What if I sell and it doubles again?"

Lisa is increasingly anxious about concentration but feels unable to push Kevin on the issue. Marital tension has developed around financial planning.

## Exhibit 3: Trading Constraints

### Insider Trading Policy

```
Kevin is a Section 16 Officer:
- Must pre-clear all trades
- Subject to blackout periods
- 10-day cooling period after earnings
- Must file Form 4 within 2 business days

Typical Open Trading Windows:
- 2 weeks after earnings (4 times per year)
- Total: ~8 weeks per year

- Material non-public information exists
- During blackout periods
- Major product launches
- M&A discussions (frequent at TechVista)
```

### 10b5-1 Plan Considerations

```
Kevin's Concerns:
1. "Setting up a plan feels like giving up"
2. "What if I set the wrong price?"
3. "Will people think I'm bailing on the company?"
4. "The cooling period seems so long"

Reality:
- 10b5-1 is standard practice for executives
- Many colleagues have them
- Provides affirmative defense
- Removes timing anxiety
```

---

## Exhibit 4: Behavioral Assessment

### Risk Tolerance Questionnaire Results

```
Standard Risk Assessment:
Theoretical Risk Tolerance: Moderate
Actual Behavior: Extremely Aggressive (single stock)

Disconnect Analysis:
Kevin's stated risk tolerance doesn't match his actions
Concentration in TechVista = 70%+ of investable assets
Would never recommend this to others
```

### Behavioral Biases Identified

```
1. Overconfidence
   Statement: "I know this company better than anyone"
   Evidence: Believes insider knowledge = investment edge
   Reality: Can't trade on MNPI; public info already priced

2. Endowment Effect
   Statement: "This stock made me wealthy"
   Evidence: Emotional attachment to shares
   Reality: Past returns don't reduce current risk

3. Anchoring
   Statement: "It was at $125, I'll sell when it gets back"
   Evidence: Fixated on prior high
   Reality: 2020 price irrelevant to current decision

4. Loss Aversion
   Statement: "I don't want to lock in the tax bill"
   Evidence: Avoiding sales to defer taxes
   Reality: Concentration risk may exceed tax cost

5. Status Quo Bias
   Statement: "I've always held it, why change now?"
   Evidence: Inertia despite changed circumstances
   Reality: Situation has changed (wealth level, age)

6. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
   Statement: "What if I sell and it goes to $200?"
   Evidence: Anxiety about missing gains
   Reality: Also at risk if it goes to $30
```

### Conversation with Kevin

```
Advisor: "If you had $5M in cash today, would you invest
         it all in TechVista stock?"

Kevin: "Of course not. That would be crazy."

Advisor: "But that's essentially what you're doing by
         keeping it there."

Kevin: [Long pause] "I know, but it feels different."
```

## Exhibit 5: Financial Goals

### Stated Goals

```
1. Retirement
   - Target: Age 57-60 (10-13 years)
   - Lifestyle: Similar to current
   - Annual spending: ~$200,000

2. Children's Education

Current diversified: $1.6M
Gap: $3.4M needed outside TechVista

Education (3-7 year horizon):
Need: $400K
Current 529: $180K
Gap: $220K

Vacation Home (3 years):
Need: $1.5-2M
Current diversified liquid: ~$470K
Gap: $1M+ (would require stock sale)

Summary:
Goals require diversification—can't achieve with
TechVista stock alone (too risky for known needs)
```

Financially devastating
```

### Historical Precedents

```
Tech Company Single-Stock Risk:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Company         Peak → Trough    Time Period
Cisco           $80 → $11        2000-2002 (-86%)

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Apply behavioral finance concepts to real client situations
- Navigate the practical constraints executives face
- Design comprehensive diversification strategies
- Address emotional and psychological barriers
- Balance tax efficiency with risk management

### Key Insights

**The Concentration Reality:**
```
Kevin's Company Exposure:

Explicit:
TechVista stock:        $4,800,000    52%
Stock options:          $  800,000     9%
Unvested RSUs:          $  750,000     8%
Deferred comp:          $  350,000     4%
────────────────────────────────────────
Total:                  $6,700,000    73%

Human Capital (PV of future earnings):
10 years × $625K/year × 6 discount = ~$4.6M

Combined:
Financial + Human: $11.3M / $13.8M = 82%

Kevin has 82%+ of total wealth tied to TechVista!
```

**The Tax Trap:**
```
Kevin's concern: "I don't want to pay $1.4M in taxes"

Reality:
- Tax is on $3.7M gain (already "made")
- Keeping position risks entire $4.8M
- Expected loss in bear case: $2.4M (worse than tax)
- Tax deferral ≠ tax elimination
- May face higher rates later

Reframe: "Would you pay $1.4M for insurance against
losing $2-4M? That's essentially the trade."
```

**The Behavioral Challenge:**
```
Kevin's stated preferences contradict his behavior:
- Says he's "moderate" risk tolerance
- Holds 73% in single stock (extreme risk)
- Would never advise friend to do this
- Knows intellectually he should diversify
- Emotionally unable to pull trigger

This is classic behavioral finance gap between
knowing and doing.
```

### Model Solution Framework

**Diversification Timeline:**

```
Current State:
TechVista: 73% ($6.7M)
Target: <20% ($1.8M or less with growth)
Need to diversify: ~$5M over 5 years

Year 1:
- Establish 10b5-1 plan
- Sell $800K TechVista stock
- Exercise $300K options (oldest expiring)
- Concentration: 60%

Year 2:
- 10b5-1 continues: $900K sales
- Exercise $400K options
- Address RSU vesting with immediate sales
- Concentration: 48%

Year 3:
- 10b5-1 continues: $1M sales
- Exercise remaining $100K options
- Fund vacation home from sales
- Concentration: 35%

Year 4:
- 10b5-1 continues: $1M sales
- Diversification accelerating
- Concentration: 25%

Year 5:
- 10b5-1 concludes or continues
- Final push to <20%
- Concentration: 18%

After Year 5:
- Maintain through ongoing RSU sales
- Annual "diversification budget" for new grants
```

**10b5-1 Plan Parameters:**

```
Establishment:
- Set up during next open window
- 90-day cooling period (required)
- Document non-MNPI status

Structure:
- Duration: 24 months (renewable)
- Monthly sales: $75,000-100,000
- Price: Market order or 5% limit below
- Automatic execution

Compliance:
- Pre-clear with legal
- File Form 4 after each trade
- No modifications without new plan
```

**Target Portfolio (Diversified Assets):**

```
After diversification complete:
Total Portfolio: ~$12M

TechVista (remaining): $2.4M (20%)
Diversified: $9.6M (80%)

Diversified Allocation:
────────────────────────────────────────
US Equity Index           30%    $2.88M
US Small Value            10%    $0.96M
International Developed   15%    $1.44M
Emerging Markets           5%    $0.48M
Core Bonds                20%    $1.92M
TIPS                       5%    $0.48M
Real Estate (REIT)         5%    $0.48M
Cash                      10%    $0.96M
────────────────────────────────────────
Total Diversified        100%    $9.6M

Rationale:
- Already have 20% in risky single stock
- Diversified portion should be "boring"
- Higher bond allocation to offset concentration
- Real estate for diversification
- Cash for opportunities and peace of mind
```

**Behavioral Interventions:**

```
1. Pre-Commitment Device
   - Sign written diversification agreement
   - Include specific targets and timeline
   - Lisa as accountability partner
   - Quarterly review with advisor

2. Reframing
   - "Selling to diversify" → "Buying peace of mind"
   - "Giving up upside" → "Protecting downside"
   - "Paying taxes" → "Locking in gains"
   - Show historical examples of single-stock disasters

3. Automation
   - 10b5-1 removes timing decision
   - Automatic RSU sales upon vesting
   - Systematic, not emotional

4. Mental Accounting
   - Create "Freedom Fund" with diversified assets
   - TechVista is "bonus" wealth
   - Financial plan based on diversified only

5. Scenario Visualization
   - Walk through bear case scenarios
   - "How would you feel if TechVista fell 50%?"
   - "What would Lisa say?"
   - Make risk concrete
```

**Involving Lisa:**

```
Lisa's Role:
- Joint decision-making
- Accountability partner
- Risk perspective (she sees it more clearly)
- Estate planning integration

Approach:
1. Include Lisa in all planning meetings
2. Discuss goals as a couple
3. Her concerns are valid—acknowledge them
4. Create joint written agreement
5. Regular family financial reviews
```

**Addressing "What if it doubles?":**

```
Advisor Response:

"Kevin, let me ask you a question. If you sold half your
TechVista stock today and the stock then doubled, how
would you feel about the half you kept?"

[Kevin: "Great!"]

"And you'd still have $5M+ in TechVista, right? You'd
still participate in the upside significantly."

"Now let me ask another question. If you kept everything
and the stock fell 50%, how would you feel?"

[Kevin: Silent]

"The reality is that selling some doesn't mean you're
'missing out'—you're still exposed. You're just
choosing to have some certainty alongside the possibility.

Think of it this way: You've already won the game.
Now the goal is to not lose. That's what diversification
accomplishes."
```

### Discussion Questions

1. What is the advisor's obligation when a client is making what seems like an obviously poor decision? How hard should they push?

2. Should the advisor involve Lisa even if Kevin prefers to handle finances himself?

3. Is there ever a case where holding concentrated stock makes sense? What would justify it?

4. How do you balance tax efficiency with risk management? Is deferring $1.4M in taxes worth the concentration risk?

5. What role does the company culture play? If all executives hold concentrated stock, does that make it more acceptable?

### Quantitative Exercises

1. Calculate the expected value and risk of Kevin's current portfolio vs. the diversified target using Monte Carlo simulation.

2. Model the tax impact of different diversification timelines (fast vs. slow).

3. Calculate the "cost" of concentration in terms of certainty-equivalent wealth.

4. Design option exercise strategy that minimizes total tax burden.
