# Case Study: University Endowment Redesign

## Executive Summary

Westbrook University's $450 million endowment has underperformed peers for five years while experiencing significant governance challenges. The new CIO, Sarah Mitchell, has been tasked with redesigning the investment policy and rebuilding the investment committee's confidence. You are advising on the comprehensive portfolio redesign.

**Key Question:** How should the endowment's investment policy, asset allocation, and governance be restructured to achieve long-term objectives while managing stakeholder concerns?

## Background

### Institution Overview

- **Institution:** Westbrook University, private liberal arts college
- **Location:** Northeast United States
- **Enrollment:** 4,500 students
- **Annual Budget:** $180 million
- **Endowment:** $450 million (endowment per student: $100,000)
- **Endowment as % of Budget:** Supports 15% of operating budget

### History

Westbrook was founded in 1850 and built its endowment primarily through alumni donations over the past 50 years. The endowment grew significantly during the 1990s and 2000s but has struggled in the last decade to keep pace with peer institutions.

### Current Situation

The previous CIO retired after 15 years, during which the endowment pursued a traditional 60/40 allocation supplemented by modest alternative investments. Performance has lagged the policy benchmark and peer institutions significantly.

## Exhibit 3: Spending and Liabilities

### Spending Policy

```
Current Policy:
- Spend 5% of trailing 12-quarter average market value
- Smoothed to reduce volatility
- Board may adjust ±1% for extraordinary circumstances

Annual Distribution:
- Current: $22.5 million (5% × $450M)
- Supports 12.5% of operating budget
- Growing dependence on endowment spending
```

### Financial Pressure

```
Budget Challenges:
- Tuition revenue flat (enrollment pressure)
- Federal research funding declining
- Deferred maintenance backlog: $75 million
- New science building needed: $80 million capital campaign

Endowment Expectations:
- Maintain 5% spending in perpetuity
- Grow to preserve purchasing power
- Support future capital needs
```

### Real Return Requirement

```
Calculation:
Spending rate:                5.0%
Inflation assumption:         2.5%
Fees and expenses:           0.8%
────────────────────────────────────
Required real return:         8.3%

Historical achievement:       5.5% real
Gap:                         2.8%

This gap explains purchasing power erosion
```

| **Expense Ratio** | 0.82% | 0.48% | 0.52% | N/A |

### Key Differences

```
Westbrook vs. Better-Performing Peers:

1. Public Equity: Too high, too active, too expensive
2. Alternatives: Too low, wrong structure (FOF)
3. Fixed Income: Too high for perpetual horizon
4. Implementation: Active where passive works better
5. Fees: 50%+ higher than comparable peers
```

## Analysis Questions

### Part A: Current State Assessment (25 points)

1. Calculate the effective real return requirement given spending policy, inflation, and fees. Is the current allocation likely to achieve this?

2. Analyze the performance attribution. What are the primary drivers of underperformance vs. peers?

3. Evaluate the governance structure. What specific weaknesses need to be addressed?

4. Assess the current fee structure. Where are the biggest savings opportunities?

### Part B: Asset Allocation Redesign (25 points)

1. Design a new strategic asset allocation for the endowment. Specify:
   - Asset class targets and ranges
   - Rationale for each allocation decision
   - Expected return and risk characteristics

2. How should the allocation differ from the "Yale Model" given Westbrook's size and resources?

3. What role should alternatives play? How should the hedge fund and private equity programs be restructured?

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Apply institutional portfolio management principles
- Balance competing stakeholder interests
- Design appropriate asset allocation for perpetual investors
- Navigate governance challenges
- Implement cost-effective investment strategies

### Key Insights

**The Math Problem:**
```
Required return for sustainability:
Spending:     5.0%
Inflation:    2.5%
Fees:         0.8%
──────────────────
Minimum:      8.3% nominal

Current allocation expected return: ~6.5%
Gap: 1.8% annually

This gap compounds:
Over 10 years: 20% purchasing power erosion
Over 20 years: 35% purchasing power erosion
```

**Why Peers Outperform:**
```
1. Higher equity allocation (risk premium)
2. Alternatives access (illiquidity premium)
3. Lower fees (0.50% vs 0.82%)
4. Better manager selection
5. More decisive governance
```

**Size Limitations:**
```
At $450M, Westbrook cannot fully replicate Yale:
- Limited access to top PE/VC funds
- Can't build internal team economically
- Fund-of-funds cost prohibitive
- Must rely more on public markets

Appropriate model: "Yale-lite"
- Higher alternatives than current (25-35%)
- But not as high as mega-endowments (50%+)
- Focus on low-cost where can't add value
```

### Model Solution Framework

**Recommended Allocation:**

```
Asset Class                  Current    Proposed    Change
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Public Equity                 52%        50%        -2%
  US Large Cap (passive)      28%        25%        -3%
  US Small/Value (passive)     8%        10%        +2%
  International (passive)     12%        10%        -2%
  Emerging Markets             4%         5%        +1%

Fixed Income                  28%        15%       -13%
  Core Bonds                  25%        10%       -15%
  TIPS                         3%         5%        +2%

Alternatives                  17%        30%       +13%
  Private Equity               5%        12%        +7%
  Real Estate                  4%         8%        +4%
  Hedge Funds                  8%         5%        -3%
  Infrastructure               0%         5%        +5%

Cash                           3%         5%        +2%

Expected Return:              6.5%       7.8%      +1.3%
Expected Volatility:         10.0%      12.5%      +2.5%
Expense Ratio:               0.82%      0.40%     -0.42%
```

**Implementation Approach:**

```
Public Equity (Passive):
- US Large Cap: Vanguard Total Stock Market (0.03%)
- US Small Value: Factor ETF (0.10%)
- International: Vanguard Total Intl (0.08%)
- EM: Vanguard EM (0.10%)

Fixed Income (Mostly Passive):
- Core: Vanguard Total Bond (0.03%)
- TIPS: Vanguard TIPS ETF (0.05%)

Alternatives (Active/Direct):
- PE: Direct fund commitments, build over 4-6 years
- Real Estate: 2 open-end core funds
- Hedge Funds: Direct relationships, 3 managers max
- Infrastructure: Listed + 1 private fund

Target Expense: 0.40% (save ~$1.9M annually)
```

**Private Equity Pacing:**

```
Target: 12% = $54M
Current: 5% = $22.5M
Need to add: $31.5M

Pacing Plan (6-year ramp):
Year 1: $8M commitment (vintage diversification)
Year 2: $10M commitment
Year 3: $10M commitment
Year 4: $8M commitment
Year 5: $6M commitment
Year 6: $5M commitment

Focus: Small/mid buyout funds with $50-200M minimums
Build relationships with 2-3 fund families
```

**Governance Recommendations:**

```
1. Monthly investment committee meetings
2. Clear delegation to CIO for execution
3. Committee focuses on policy, not tactics
4. Annual IPS review required
5. Board education program
6. Consultant: Replace or reduce scope
7. Add risk management reporting
8. Create subcommittee for alternatives
```

**IPS Key Elements:**

```
Return Objective:
"Achieve average annual nominal return of 7.5-8.5%
over rolling 10-year periods, sufficient to
support 5% spending while preserving purchasing
power in perpetuity."

Risk Objective:
"Maintain portfolio volatility of 10-14% annualized.
Accept short-term volatility in pursuit of long-term
returns. Manage liquidity to ensure spending needs
are met in all market conditions."

Rebalancing:
"Rebalance quarterly if any asset class exceeds
allowable range. CIO has authority to rebalance
within ranges. Deviations beyond ranges require
Committee approval within 30 days."
```

### Discussion Questions

1. Should Westbrook try to achieve "peer median" returns, or accept more conservative approach with lower spending?

2. How do you build support for increasing risk on an investment committee with conservative members?

3. What is the appropriate level of alternatives for a $450M endowment? What are the practical constraints?

4. How should the CIO balance her strong views with committee consensus-driven culture?

5. Should endowments adopt Yale-style allocations if they lack access to top managers?

### Quantitative Exercises

1. Calculate expected return and standard deviation for proposed allocation using historical data.

2. Model spending path under current vs. proposed allocation over 20 years.

3. Calculate break-even expense ratio that would make active management worthwhile.

4. Design private equity pacing model with J-curve effects.
