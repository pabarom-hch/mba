# Executive Investment Challenges

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the unique investment challenges facing executives
- Develop strategies for managing concentrated stock positions
- Navigate 10b5-1 plans and insider trading regulations
- Integrate illiquid compensation into financial planning
- Account for human capital and career risk
- Overcome behavioral biases common to successful executives

---

## Introduction

Executives face investment challenges that typical investors don't encounter. Concentrated stock positions, illiquid equity compensation, insider trading restrictions, and career risk tied to a single company create unique planning needs. Success in business can actually create financial vulnerability if these challenges aren't addressed proactively. This topic provides frameworks for managing executive-specific investment issues.

## Core Concepts

### The Executive Dilemma

```
Typical Executive Financial Profile:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
High Income:
• Base salary: $300K-$1M+
• Annual bonus: 50-100% of base
• Long-term incentives: 100-300% of base
• Total comp: $500K-$3M+

Concentrated Wealth:
• Company stock: 50-90% of net worth (common!)
• Stock options (vested and unvested)
• RSUs with vesting schedules
• Deferred compensation
• Pension (if applicable)

Career Risk:
• Income dependent on single employer
• Job security tied to company performance
• Skills may be company-specific
• Senior executives face unique termination risk

Result: Extreme concentration in single company
        Both income AND wealth tied to same entity
```

### Why Concentration Persists

```
Rational Reasons:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Insider information (can't trade)
• Blackout periods limit trading
• Large blocks difficult to sell
• Signal concerns (perception of selling)
• Tax consequences of selling
• Vesting restrictions

Behavioral Reasons:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Overconfidence ("I know this company")
• Endowment effect ("This made me wealthy")
• Familiarity bias ("I trust what I know")
• Loss aversion ("Don't want to give up upside")
• Anchoring ("Waiting for $X price")
• Status quo bias ("I've always held it")
```

---

## Concentrated Stock Positions

### The Risk of Concentration

```
Concentration Risk Statistics:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• 90% of executive wealth in single stock = catastrophic risk
• Individual stocks have ~30% annual volatility
• 40% of Russell 3000 stocks lose 75%+ at some point
• Even successful companies can collapse (Enron, Lehman)

Comparison:
Single Stock:   30% annual volatility
Diversified:    15% annual volatility

Same return expectation, twice the risk!
```

### Case Studies in Concentration Risk

```
Cautionary Examples:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Enron (2001):
• Stock price: $90 → $0
• Employees lost retirement savings
• Many executives held concentrated positions

Lehman Brothers (2008):
• CEO held $900M+ in stock
• Value dropped to near zero
• Decades of wealth accumulation destroyed

WorldCom (2002):
• Peak market cap: $115B
• Bankruptcy: $0

Lesson: No company is "too big to fail"
        Concentration = massive personal risk
```

### Diversification Target

```
Guidelines for Concentration:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Maximum single-stock position: 10% of investable assets
(Some advisors recommend 5%)

If Currently >10%:
1. Develop diversification plan
2. Timeline based on restrictions
3. Systematic, not emotional
4. Tax-efficient approach

Never hold >25%:
If restricted from selling, hedge exposure
```

## 10b5-1 Plans

### What Is a 10b5-1 Plan?

```
Definition:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A written plan for trading company securities that:
• Is established when NOT in possession of MNPI
• Specifies amount, price, and dates
• Provides affirmative defense to insider trading

Key Elements:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Written plan adopted in good faith
2. Created when no MNPI exists
3. Specifies trading parameters
4. No subsequent influence on trades
5. Broker executes mechanically

Cooling-Off Period (as of 2023):
• Directors/officers: 90 days minimum
• Others: 30 days minimum
• Cannot be modified with MNPI
```

### 10b5-1 Plan Structures

```
Common Plan Types:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fixed Price:
"Sell 5,000 shares on the 15th of each month"
• Simple and predictable
• No price conditions
• Executes regardless of market

Limit Orders:
"Sell 5,000 shares if price exceeds $100"
• Price protection
• May not execute
• Timing uncertainty

Percentage-of-Volume:
"Sell up to 10% of daily volume"
• Reduces market impact
• Variable timing
• Good for large positions
```

### 10b5-1 Best Practices

```
Do:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Establish during open windows
• Use extended timeframes
• Document reason for plan
• Consult with counsel
• Review annually

Don't:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Establish during blackouts
• Modify frequently
• Cancel and replace
• Establish multiple overlapping plans
• Use for short-term trading
```

## Equity Compensation

### Stock Options

```
Types of Stock Options:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Incentive Stock Options (ISO):
• Favorable tax treatment
• $100K annual limit
• Must hold 2 years from grant, 1 year from exercise
• AMT may apply at exercise
• Long-term capital gains at sale

Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSO):
• No limit on value
• Taxed as ordinary income at exercise
• Spread = Income (subject to withholding)
• Less favorable but simpler

Key Terms:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Grant Price (Strike): Price to buy shares
Current Price: Market value
Spread: Current - Strike (your profit)
Vesting: When options become exercisable
Expiration: When options expire (often 10 years)
```

### Option Exercise Strategy

```
When to Exercise:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Must Consider:
1. Time remaining until expiration
2. Current spread vs. potential appreciation
3. Diversification needs
4. Tax implications
5. Cash available for exercise/taxes

General Guidelines:
• Don't exercise if no spread (underwater)
• Exercise expiring options with spread
• Consider exercising if highly concentrated
• Tax-loss harvesting in other positions

ISO Special Considerations:
• Early exercise may minimize AMT
• Disqualifying disposition converts to NSO treatment
• 83(b) election for early exercise
```

### Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

```
RSU Basics:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What: Promise to deliver shares at vesting
Vesting: Time-based, performance-based, or both
Tax: Ordinary income on vesting date
Withholding: Typically shares surrendered for taxes

Planning Considerations:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Can't control timing (vesting date fixed)
• "Forced" stock acquisition
• Immediate diversification often wise
• Coordinate with 10b5-1 plan

Tax Example:
Grant: 1,000 RSUs
Vest date: Share price $100
Income: $100,000 (ordinary)
Tax (37% + state): ~$40,000+
Net shares: ~600 (after tax withholding)
```

### Deferred Compensation

```
Non-Qualified Deferred Comp (NQDC):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What: Elective deferral of compensation
Tax: Deferred until distribution
Risk: Unsecured creditor of company

Key Considerations:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Company credit risk
   • If company fails, deferred comp at risk
   • Already have job risk to same company
   • Think carefully about total exposure

2. Investment elections
   • Choose from limited menu
   • Notional returns (no actual investments)
   • Tax-efficient vehicle if company stable

3. Distribution timing
   • Usually at separation or specified dates
   • 409A rules strict on changes
   • Plan for tax impact at distribution

4. Estate planning
   • Taxable to estate/heirs
   • Consider in overall plan
```

## Human Capital and Career Risk

### Human Capital Defined

```
Present Value of Future Earnings:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Executive, Age 45:
Annual compensation: $500,000
Years to retirement: 20
Discount rate: 3%
PV of earnings: ~$7.5 million

This is the largest "asset" most executives have!

Characteristics:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Cannot be sold or transferred
• Tied to single employer (often)
• Correlated with company stock
• Diminishes over time
• Skills may be company-specific
```

### Career Risk for Executives

```
Executive-Specific Risks:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Termination Risk
   • Performance-related
   • M&A activity
   • Board/CEO changes
   • Restructuring

2. Industry Risk
   • Sector downturns
   • Disruption
   • Regulatory changes

3. Reputation Risk
   • Association with failure
   • Industry blacklisting
   • Non-compete restrictions

Mitigation:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Diversify investments away from company/industry
• Build emergency fund (12+ months)
• Maintain external network
• Understand severance provisions
• Consider disability insurance
```

### Total Wealth Framework

```
All Assets/Income Tied to Company:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Company Stock:          $2,000,000
Stock Options:          $  500,000
RSUs (unvested):        $  300,000
Deferred Comp:          $  500,000
Human Capital:          $5,000,000
────────────────────────────────────────
Total Company Exposure: $8,300,000

Other Assets:           $  700,000

Company Exposure:       92% of total wealth!

Even "diversified" financial portfolio doesn't help
if 90%+ of total wealth tied to one company.

Recommendation:
• Diversify AGGRESSIVELY in financial portfolio
• Reduce company stock as fast as practical
• Consider hedging if restrictions prevent selling
```

---

## Hedging Strategies

### Why Hedge?

```
Situations Requiring Hedging:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Large unrealized gains (tax prohibitive to sell)
• Contractual restrictions (lockups, holding requirements)
• Signal concerns (executive selling = bad optics)
• Timing restrictions (blackouts, 10b5-1 waiting)

Hedging Goals:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Protect against downside
• Defer capital gains
• Maintain position (technically)
• Create liquidity
```

### Hedging Strategies

```
Protective Put:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What: Buy put option on your stock
Protection: Limits downside to strike price
Cost: Premium paid
Upside: Unlimited (you still own stock)
Tax: No sale, premium may be deductible

Example:
Own 10,000 shares at $100 ($1M position)
Buy $90 strike put for $3/share
Cost: $30,000
Protection: Loss limited to $130,000
            (10% drop + premium)

Cashless Collar:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What: Buy put + sell call (zero cost)
Protection: Downside limited to put strike
Trade-off: Upside capped at call strike
Cost: Zero (call premium pays for put)

Example:
Stock at $100
Buy $85 put
Sell $120 call
Cost: $0
Outcome: Position locked between $85-$120

Prepaid Variable Forward:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What: Receive cash now, deliver shares later
Cash: ~80% of stock value immediately
Delivery: Shares or cash at maturity (2-5 years)
Tax: Deferred until maturity
Complexity: High, requires specialist

Exchange Fund:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What: Contribute stock to diversified fund
Receive: Proportional ownership of fund
Benefit: Diversification without immediate sale
Lock-up: 7 years typically
Tax: Deferred until fund redemption
Qualification: Must be accredited, specific rules
```

### Hedging Considerations

```
Factors to Evaluate:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cost:
• Put premiums can be expensive
• Zero-cost collar gives up upside
• Transaction costs

Complexity:
• Tax rules are intricate
• Constructive sale risk
• Legal compliance requirements

Liquidity:
• Options have expiration
• Some strategies create obligations

Tax:
• Timing of gain recognition
• Character of gain/loss
• AMT implications
```

## Behavioral Challenges

### Common Executive Biases

```
Overconfidence:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Manifestation: "I built this company, I know it"
Reality: Insider knowledge ≠ stock prediction
Solution: Systematic diversification rules

Endowment Effect:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Manifestation: "This stock made me wealthy"
Reality: Past success doesn't reduce current risk
Solution: Ask "Would I buy this position today?"

Anchoring:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Manifestation: "I'll sell when it hits $100"
Reality: Purchase price is irrelevant
Solution: Evaluate based on current value

Loss Aversion:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Manifestation: "I can't sell below what I paid"
Reality: Loss already happened (unrealized)
Solution: Focus on opportunity cost

Status Quo Bias:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Manifestation: "I've always held company stock"
Reality: Past behavior isn't justification
Solution: Pre-commitment to diversification plan
```

### Behavioral Solutions

```
Systematic Approaches:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. 10b5-1 Plan
   • Pre-commits to sales
   • Removes timing decision
   • Mechanical execution

2. Written Diversification Policy
   • Target: <10% in company stock
   • Timeline: 3-5 years to achieve
   • Signed commitment

3. Advisor with Authority
   • Give advisor permission to diversify
   • Remove yourself from decision
   • Regular accountability reviews

4. Automatic Exercise/Sale
   • Exercise options upon vesting
   • Sell RSU shares upon receipt
   • Immediate diversification

5. Mental Accounting
   • Consider company stock as "bonus"
   • Diversified portfolio is "real" wealth
   • Reduces psychological attachment
```

## Worked Example

### Executive Financial Plan

**Profile:**

```
Name: Jennifer Martinez, Chief Marketing Officer
Company: TechGrowth Inc. (publicly traded)
Age: 48
Compensation:
  - Base: $450,000
  - Bonus target: $225,000
  - RSUs: $400,000/year (4-year vesting)
  - Stock options: 50,000 shares, $40 strike

Current Financial Position:
  - Company stock: $2.2M (unvested RSUs: $800K add'l)
  - Stock options: $1.5M spread (partially vested)
  - 401(k): $800,000
  - Deferred comp: $400,000
  - Taxable investments: $300,000
  - Cash: $100,000
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Total: $6.1M ($5.9M company-related)
```

**Analysis:**

```
Company Exposure:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Company stock:        $2,200,000    36%
Stock options:        $1,500,000    25%
Unvested RSUs:        $  800,000    13%
Deferred comp:        $  400,000     7%
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total company:        $4,900,000    80%

Plus human capital (income depends on TechGrowth)!

Non-company:          $1,200,000    20%

Assessment: SEVERE concentration risk
```

**Recommendations:**

```
Immediate Actions (Month 1-3):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Establish 10b5-1 Plan
   • Sell $100K/quarter (within guidelines)
   • Covers vesting RSUs plus additional
   • 90-day cooling period

2. Exercise Options Strategy
   • Prioritize oldest tranches (expiration risk)
   • Exercise and sell to diversify
   • Tax planning for exercise timing

3. Stop Deferred Comp Contributions
   • Already $400K at company risk
   • Redirect to 401(k) and taxable

4. Reposition 401(k)
   • Ensure no company stock
   • Aggressive diversification (already overexposed)

Short-Term (Year 1):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Sell $500K company stock via 10b5-1
• Exercise/sell $200K in options
• Build taxable diversified portfolio

Medium-Term Target (3-5 years):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Company stock: <15% of portfolio
Options: Exercise as favorable
Diversified investments: >50% of portfolio
Emergency fund: 12 months expenses ($150K)

Asset Allocation (Non-Company):
────────────────────────────────────────────────
US Equity Index:       40%
International Equity:  20%
Bonds:                 30%
Cash:                  10%

Rationale: Already massively overweight
single equity (TechGrowth), so diversified
portfolio should be more conservative than
typical 48-year-old allocation.
```
