## Introduction

An Investment Policy Statement (IPS) is the foundational document governing investment decisions. It articulates objectives, constraints, and guidelines that direct all investment activity. A well-crafted IPS removes emotion from decision-making, provides a roadmap during market volatility, and ensures alignment between stakeholders. Every serious investor—individual or institutional—needs an IPS.

## Return Objectives

### Defining Return Objectives

```
Return Objective Components:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Absolute Return Target
   "Achieve average annual return of 7%"

2. Relative Return Target
   "Outperform policy benchmark by 0.5% net of fees"

3. Real vs. Nominal
   "Achieve real return of 5% above inflation"

4. Spending + Growth
   "Support 4% annual spending while preserving
   purchasing power"

Key Considerations:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Must be realistic and achievable
• Consistent with risk tolerance
• Specific enough to measure
• Time-period appropriate
```

### Return Objective Examples

```
Individual Investor:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"The portfolio seeks to achieve an average annual
total return of 6-7% over rolling 10-year periods,
sufficient to:
• Grow the portfolio to $5,000,000 by retirement
• Support $200,000 annual retirement spending
• Maintain purchasing power against inflation"

Endowment:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"The Endowment seeks to earn an average annual real
return of 5% (net of fees) over rolling 10-year
periods. This return target supports:
• Annual spending of 4.5% of trailing 12-quarter
  average market value
• Preservation of endowment purchasing power
  in perpetuity"
```

```

### Risk Objective Examples

```
Conservative Individual:

"The investor has moderate risk tolerance, reflecting:
• Ability: 15-year time horizon, stable income, modest
  liquidity needs (HIGH ability)
• Willingness: Uncomfortable with volatility greater
  than 10%, would panic-sell at 20% loss (LOW willingness)

Risk Objective: Portfolio should target annual
volatility of 8-10% and avoid maximum drawdowns
exceeding 15% in most market conditions."

Growth-Oriented Investor:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"The investor has high risk tolerance, reflecting:
• Ability: 25-year horizon, no liquidity needs,
  high income relative to needs
• Willingness: Experienced investor, comfortable
  with volatility, historically stayed the course

Risk Objective: Portfolio may experience volatility
of 15-18% and drawdowns of 30-40% during market
corrections. Investor is prepared to maintain
strategy through such periods."
