# Asset Classes

## Learning Objectives

- Understand characteristics of major asset classes
- Analyze risk-return profiles for each asset class
- Evaluate historical performance and correlations
- Identify appropriate uses for each asset class in portfolios
- Recognize sub-asset class distinctions

---

## Introduction

Asset classes are groups of investments with similar characteristics, behavior, and regulatory treatment. Understanding asset classes is foundational to portfolio construction—each plays a specific role in achieving investor objectives. The key is matching asset class characteristics to investor needs.

## Core Concepts

### What Defines an Asset Class?

```
Characteristics of a True Asset Class:

1. Distinct Risk-Return Profile
   - Different expected returns
   - Different risk characteristics
   - Unique return drivers

2. Low Correlation to Others
   - Provides diversification benefit
   - Not perfectly correlated
   - Different economic sensitivities

3. Investable at Scale
   - Sufficient market depth
   - Reasonable transaction costs
   - Accessible to investors

4. Homogeneous Securities
   - Similar characteristics within class
   - Common valuation approaches
   - Comparable legal treatment
```

## Fixed Income (Bonds)

### Characteristics

```
Debt obligations providing periodic interest and principal

Return Drivers:
- Interest payments (coupon)
- Price appreciation/depreciation
- Reinvestment of coupons
- Credit spread changes

Risks:
- Interest rate risk (duration)
- Credit risk
- Inflation risk
- Reinvestment risk
- Liquidity risk

Long-term Return: 4-6% nominal (1-3% real)
Volatility: 4-10% standard deviation (varies by duration)
```

### Fixed Income Categories

```
By Issuer:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Government (Treasuries)
├── Risk-free rate (no credit risk)
├── Most liquid
├── Interest rate risk only
├── Tax: Federal, exempt from state
└── Use: Safety, deflation hedge

Agency
├── GSE debt (Fannie, Freddie)
├── Implicit government backing
├── Slightly higher yield
└── MBS: prepayment risk

Municipal
├── State and local government
├── Tax-exempt (federal, often state)
├── Lower nominal yield
├── Tax-equivalent yield calculation
└── Credit risk varies

Corporate Investment Grade
├── BBB-/Baa3 and above
├── Credit spread over Treasuries
├── Moderate credit risk
└── Higher yield than government

Corporate High Yield (Junk)
├── Below investment grade
├── Significant credit risk
├── Equity-like characteristics
├── Higher correlation to stocks
└── 3-5% spread over Treasuries

International/Emerging
├── Currency risk
├── Political risk
├── Diversification benefit
└── Higher yields available
```

```
By Maturity:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Short-term (0-3 years)
├── Low interest rate risk
├── Low yield
├── High liquidity
└── Use: Stability, near-term needs

Intermediate (3-10 years)
├── Moderate interest rate risk
├── Balanced risk/return
└── Most efficient duration

Long-term (10+ years)
├── High interest rate risk
├── Higher yield
├── Volatility similar to stocks
└── Use: Liability matching, deflation hedge
```

### Duration Concept

```
Duration: Sensitivity to interest rate changes

Approximate price change = -Duration × Change in yield

Example:
Bond duration: 7 years
Interest rates rise 1%
Price change: -7% (approximately)

Key Point:
Higher duration = Higher interest rate risk
Match duration to investment horizon
```

### Tax-Equivalent Yield

```
Formula:
Tax-Equivalent Yield = Municipal Yield / (1 - Tax Rate)

Example:
Muni yield: 4%
Tax bracket: 37% federal + 5% state = 42%

Tax-equivalent = 4% / (1 - 0.42) = 6.9%

Conclusion: Compare 4% muni to 6.9% taxable
```

```

### Cash Allocation Decisions

```
Hold More Cash When:

## Asset Class Selection Framework

### Matching to Investor Needs

```
Investor Need            Primary Asset Classes
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Growth                   Equities, alternatives
Income                   Bonds, dividend stocks, REITs
Capital preservation     Short-term bonds, cash
Inflation protection     TIPS, real estate, commodities
Tax efficiency          Municipal bonds, equities (LTCG)
Liquidity                Cash, public markets
Diversification          Low-correlation assets
```

### Risk Capacity vs. Risk Tolerance

```
Risk Capacity (Ability):
- Time horizon
- Income stability
- Wealth level
- Spending flexibility

Risk Tolerance (Willingness):
- Psychological comfort
- Past behavior
- Emotional reactions
- Sleep-at-night test

Asset Allocation should reflect LOWER of the two
```

---

## Executive Considerations

### Company Stock as Asset Class

```
Reality for Executives:
- Concentrated single-stock position
- Highly correlated with human capital
- Not a diversified asset class
- Requires special treatment

Risks:
- Company-specific risk (unsystematic)
- Career risk correlation
- Psychological attachment
- Tax complications

Treatment:
- Should be systematically reduced
- Not counted as "equity allocation"
- Separate tracking and planning
```

### Human Capital Integration

```
Human Capital Characteristics:
- Present value of future earnings
- Usually "bond-like" (stable salary)
- Company-specific exposure
- Decreases over time

Implications for Asset Allocation:
- Young: Human capital is "bond" → invest more aggressively
- Near retirement: Human capital depletes → reduce risk
- Executive: Human capital tied to company → diversify more
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Asset classes have distinct characteristics** - Match to investor needs
2. **Correlation is crucial** - Diversification works when assets aren't correlated
3. **Sub-asset classes matter** - Small cap ≠ large cap ≠ international
4. **Historical returns inform but don't predict** - Use ranges, not point estimates
5. **Consider after-tax returns** - Tax treatment varies significantly
6. **Company stock is concentrated risk** - Not a diversified equity allocation
7. **Human capital affects allocation** - Consider total wealth, not just portfolio

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Tax-Equivalent Yield
A client in the 32% federal bracket (6% state) is comparing a 3.5% municipal bond to a 5.2% corporate bond. Which offers better after-tax return?

### Problem 2: Duration Risk
A bond portfolio has duration of 8 years. If interest rates rise 0.75%, what is the approximate price change?

### Problem 3: Correlation Application
Portfolio A is 60% US stocks, 40% bonds. Portfolio B is 60% US stocks, 40% international stocks. Which has better diversification and why?
