# Portfolio Construction

## Learning Objectives

- Compare active and passive investment management
- Design core-satellite portfolio structures
- Select appropriate investment vehicles (ETFs, mutual funds, individual securities)
- Implement tax-efficient asset location strategies
- Understand implementation costs and their impact
- Build complete portfolios from component parts

---

## Introduction

Once asset allocation is determined, portfolio construction turns strategy into reality. This involves selecting specific investments, choosing between active and passive management, optimizing tax efficiency, and minimizing costs. The implementation decisions matter—a good allocation poorly implemented underperforms a mediocre allocation well implemented.

---

## Core Concepts

### The Active vs. Passive Debate

```
Passive Management:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Definition: Track an index, minimize costs
Philosophy: Markets are efficient; can't beat them
Vehicles: Index funds, ETFs
Costs: 0.03% - 0.20% expense ratio
Trading: Minimal (rebalancing only)

Active Management:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Definition: Attempt to outperform benchmark
Philosophy: Markets have inefficiencies to exploit
Vehicles: Actively managed funds, separate accounts
Costs: 0.50% - 1.50% expense ratio
Trading: Frequent (generate alpha)
```

### Evidence on Active Management

```
Key Research Findings:

SPIVA Studies (S&P vs. Active):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Over 15 years, % of active funds underperforming index:

US Large Cap:        92% underperformed S&P 500
US Mid Cap:          95% underperformed S&P MidCap
US Small Cap:        97% underperformed S&P SmallCap
International:       89% underperformed benchmark
Emerging Markets:    93% underperformed benchmark

Why Active Underperforms:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Higher fees (1.0% vs. 0.05%)
2. Trading costs
3. Cash drag
4. Tax inefficiency
5. Behavioral mistakes

Before Costs: Zero-sum game
After Costs: Negative-sum for active
```

### When Active May Work

```
Potentially Fertile Ground for Active:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Less efficient markets:
- Small cap stocks
- Emerging markets
- High yield bonds
- Private markets

Specific strategies:
- Tax-loss harvesting
- Factor tilts (value, momentum)
- ESG constraints
- Concentrated high-conviction

Key: Net of fees, does manager add value?
Most don't, but some do
```

## Investment Vehicles

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

```
Characteristics:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structure: Trades like stock on exchange
Pricing: Real-time, intraday

Tax efficiency: Very high (creation/redemption)
Costs: Low expense ratios
Trading: Bid-ask spread, commissions

Advantages:
- Tax efficient
- Low costs
- Intraday trading
- Transparency
- No minimums

Disadvantages:
- Trading costs (bid-ask)

```

### Mutual Funds

```
Characteristics:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Structure: Pooled investment vehicle
Pricing: NAV calculated daily at close
Minimum: Often $1,000-$3,000
Tax efficiency: Lower (capital gains distributions)
Costs: Expense ratios, sometimes loads

Types:
- No-load index funds (recommended)
- Load funds (generally avoid)
- Active funds (most underperform)

Advantages:
- Automatic investment
- Fractional shares
- No trading costs
- Dollar-cost averaging easy

Disadvantages:
- Less tax efficient

```

### Individual Securities

```
When Appropriate:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Large accounts ($500K+ per asset class)
- Tax-loss harvesting at security level
- Specific exclusions (ESG, personal)
- Direct indexing strategies
- Municipal bond ladders

Advantages:
- Tax control
- Customization
- No fund expenses
- Visibility

Disadvantages:
- Requires more capital for diversification
- More complex management
- Higher trading costs
- Security selection risk
```

### Vehicle Comparison

```
Factor           ETF        Mutual Fund    Individual
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Costs            Low        Varies         Low
Tax efficiency   High       Moderate       Highest*
Minimum          1 share    $1K-$3K        $500K+
Diversification  High       High           Requires scale
Complexity       Low        Low            High
Customization    Limited    Limited        Full

*Individual securities offer most control but need scale
```

## Core-Satellite Approach

### Framework

```
Core Holdings (70-90% of Portfolio):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Purpose: Provide market exposure at low cost
Vehicles: Index funds, ETFs
Style: Passive, buy-and-hold
Examples:
- Total US Stock Market
- Total International
- Total Bond Market

Satellite Holdings (10-30% of Portfolio):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Purpose: Seek alpha or targeted exposure
Vehicles: Active funds, individual stocks, alternatives
Style: Active or factor-tilted
Examples:
- Small cap value tilt
- Emerging market active
- Individual stock picks
- Alternative investments

```

### Core-Satellite Benefits

```
1. Cost Efficiency
   - Core is ultra-low cost
   - Only pay active fees on satellite
   - Weighted average cost much lower

2. Tax Efficiency
   - Core is tax-efficient (low turnover)
   - Satellites may be in tax-advantaged accounts

3. Behavioral Management
   - Core provides stable foundation
   - Satellite satisfies desire to "do something"
   - Limits damage from active decisions

4. Flexibility
   - Adjust satellite without disrupting core
   - Opportunistic tilts without wholesale changes
```

## Tax-Efficient Asset Location

### The Concept

```
Asset Location: Which account holds which asset?

Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
- 401(k), IRA: Tax-deferred
- Roth IRA, Roth 401(k): Tax-free
- 529 Plans: Tax-free for education

Taxable Accounts:
- Brokerage accounts
- Trust accounts
- Subject to annual taxes on dividends, interest, gains

Key Insight:
Place tax-inefficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts
Place tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts
```

### Asset Location Framework

```
Asset                       Tax Character         Best Location
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Taxable Bonds              Ordinary income        Tax-deferred
REITs                      Ordinary income        Tax-deferred
High-yield Bonds           Ordinary income        Tax-deferred
Active Equity Funds        Short-term gains       Tax-deferred
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Municipal Bonds            Tax-exempt             Taxable
Index Equity Funds         Low turnover, LTCG     Taxable
Growth Stocks              Unrealized gains       Taxable
ETFs                       Tax-efficient          Taxable
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roth-Appropriate           Highest growth         Roth
Emerging Markets           High expected return   Roth
Small Cap Value            High expected return   Roth
```

### Asset Location Example

```
Investor Profile:
Total Portfolio: $1,000,000
Asset Allocation: 60% stocks, 40% bonds

Account Types:
- 401(k): $400,000
- Roth IRA: $100,000
- Taxable: $500,000

Target Allocation:
- US Stocks: $350,000
- International Stocks: $150,000
- Emerging Markets: $100,000
- Bonds: $400,000

Optimal Location:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
401(k) ($400K):
  - Bonds: $400,000 (tax-inefficient)

Roth IRA ($100K):
  - Emerging Markets: $100,000 (highest growth)

Taxable ($500K):
  - US Stock Index: $350,000 (tax-efficient)
  - International Index: $150,000 (tax-efficient)

Benefit:
- Bonds (high ordinary income) sheltered
- High-growth assets in tax-free Roth
- Tax-efficient equities in taxable
```

### Location Constraints

```
Reality Checks:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Not always possible to optimize perfectly
   - Account sizes may not match
   - Some assets must go in "wrong" account

2. 401(k) investment options limited
   - May not have ideal bond fund
   - Work with what's available

3. Estate planning considerations
   - Taxable gets step-up in basis at death
   - Roth avoids RMDs
   - May override pure tax efficiency

4. Rebalancing considerations
   - Easier in tax-advantaged accounts
   - May need some of each in each account
```

## Implementation Costs

### Types of Costs

```
Explicit Costs:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Expense Ratios: Annual fund fee (0.03% - 1.5%)
Commissions: Per-trade charges (often $0 now)
Loads: Front-end or back-end sales charges
Advisory Fees: Wealth manager/advisor (0.25% - 1.5%)
Platform Fees: Custodian charges

Implicit Costs:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Bid-Ask Spreads: Difference between buy/sell prices
Market Impact: Price movement from your trade
Tracking Error: Deviation from intended index
Cash Drag: Cash holdings in funds
Tax Inefficiency: Capital gains distributions
```

### Cost Impact Analysis

```
Example: $1,000,000 Portfolio, 7% Gross Return

Scenario 1: Low-cost (0.10% total)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Net return: 6.90%
After 30 years: $7,390,000

Scenario 2: Average-cost (0.75% total)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Net return: 6.25%
After 30 years: $6,106,000
Lost to fees: $1,284,000

Scenario 3: High-cost (1.50% total)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Net return: 5.50%
After 30 years: $4,984,000
Lost to fees: $2,406,000

Conclusion:
1.4% cost difference = $2.4M over 30 years
Costs compound against you!
```

### Minimizing Costs

```
Best Practices:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Use index funds/ETFs for core
   - Expense ratios under 0.10%

2. Avoid loaded funds
   - Front-end loads reduce invested capital
   - Back-end loads discourage rebalancing

3. Minimize trading
   - Set rebalancing thresholds
   - Avoid frequent changes

4. Tax-efficient placement
   - Reduces drag from taxes

5. Negotiate advisory fees
   - Fee-only advisors (not commission)
   - Scale discounts for larger accounts

6. Consider direct indexing at scale
   - No fund expenses
   - Tax-loss harvesting benefits
```

Step 3: Select Investment Vehicles
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For each sub-asset class:
- Identify options (ETF, mutual fund, individual)
- Compare costs
- Evaluate tax efficiency
- Choose lowest-cost option that meets needs

Step 4: Determine Asset Location
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Map assets to accounts
- Place tax-inefficient in tax-advantaged

Step 5: Execute Trades
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Implement in priority order
- Consider market conditions for large trades
- Document purchases

Step 6: Establish Rebalancing Plan
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Set rebalancing triggers
- Create calendar reminder
- Document policy
```

## Advanced Topics

### Factor Tilts

```
Implementing Factor Exposures:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Value Tilt:
- VTV (Vanguard Value) or IUSV (iShares)
- Small Cap Value: VBR, SLYV
- Expected premium: 2-3% annually (variable)

Momentum:
- MTUM (iShares Momentum)
- Higher turnover, less tax-efficient
- Consider in tax-advantaged

Low Volatility:
- USMV (iShares Min Vol)
- Defensive, lower beta
- May underperform in strong markets

Quality:
- QUAL (iShares Quality Factor)
- Profitable, stable companies
```

### Direct Indexing

```
For Large Portfolios ($500K+ per asset class):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What: Own individual stocks instead of fund
How: Buy all (or sample of) index constituents

Benefits:
- Tax-loss harvesting at security level
- Customization (exclude companies)
- No fund expenses
- ESG personalization

Costs:
- More complex management
- Trading costs on many positions
- Need scale for diversification

Providers:
- Parametric, Aperio (institutional)
- Wealthfront, Betterment (robo-advisors)
- Fidelity, Schwab (direct)
```

### Tax-Loss Harvesting

```
Strategy:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Identify positions with unrealized losses
2. Sell to realize the loss
3. Immediately buy similar (not identical) security
4. Harvest loss for tax benefit
5. Maintain market exposure

Example:
- Bought VTI at $200, now $180
- Loss: $20 per share
- Sell VTI, buy ITOT (similar but not identical)
- Harvest $20 loss per share
- Stay invested in market

Wash Sale Rule:
Cannot buy substantially identical security
within 30 days before or after sale
VTI → ITOT is acceptable (different fund)
VTI → VTI is wash sale (same fund)
```

## Common Mistakes

```
Mistake                          Solution
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Paying high fees                 Index funds, fee-only advisors
Ignoring taxes                   Asset location strategy
Overcomplicating                 Keep it simple, fewer funds
Chasing past performance         Stick to strategy
Frequent trading                 Systematic rebalancing only
Holding cash in retirement acct  Fully invest, match allocation
Loaded funds                     No-load only
Overlapping funds                Check holdings for redundancy
Style drift                      Review fund holdings periodically
```

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Vehicle Selection
Client has $200,000 in taxable account, $100,000 in IRA. Target: 60/40. Design portfolio with specific funds and asset location.

### Problem 2: Cost Analysis
Compare two portfolios over 25 years: Index (0.05% ER) vs. Active (0.95% ER). Assume $500,000 initial, 7% gross return.

### Problem 3: Tax Efficiency
Client has $50,000 in VTI (cost basis $60,000) and needs to rebalance. What are the tax implications? How would you handle this?
