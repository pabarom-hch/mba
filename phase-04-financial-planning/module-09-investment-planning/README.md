## Executive Applications

### CEO Investment Priorities

1. **Diversify away from company** - Reduce concentrated stock risk
2. **Protect what you have** - Risk management for existing wealth
3. **Tax efficiency** - After-tax returns matter most
4. **Liquidity planning** - Match investments to cash needs
5. **Wealth transfer** - Multi-generational considerations

### Common Executive Mistakes

- Holding too much company stock (familiarity bias)
- Overconfidence in investment ability
- Neglecting tax implications
- Timing the market vs. time in market
- Chasing returns based on recent performance
