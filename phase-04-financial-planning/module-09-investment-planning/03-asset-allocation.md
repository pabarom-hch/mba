## Introduction

Asset allocation is the most important investment decision, explaining approximately 90% of portfolio return variation over time. Strategic asset allocation determines the long-term mix of assets based on goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. This topic provides frameworks for making this critical decision.

---

## Core Concepts

### The Asset Allocation Decision

```
Why Asset Allocation Matters:

Studies on Return Determinants:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Asset allocation policy:        ~90% of return variance
Security selection:             ~5% of return variance
Market timing:                  ~2% of return variance
Other factors:                  ~3% of return variance

Conclusion: Get asset allocation right first
Individual security selection is secondary
```

### Strategic vs. Tactical Allocation

```
Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Definition: Long-term, policy allocation
Time Horizon: 5+ years
Basis: Goals, risk tolerance, constraints
Changes: Only when circumstances change
Example: 60% stocks, 40% bonds

Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Definition: Short-term deviations from SAA
Time Horizon: Months to 2 years
Basis: Market valuation, economic outlook
Changes: Opportunistic
Example: Temporarily overweight stocks by 5%

Reality Check:
- SAA is primary driver of returns
- TAA rarely adds value consistently
- Most investors should focus on SAA
```

## Determining Asset Allocation

### Key Factors

```
Factor               Impact on Allocation
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Time Horizon         Longer → More stocks
Risk Tolerance       Higher → More stocks
Risk Capacity        Higher → More stocks
Goals                Growth vs. income needs
Liquidity Needs      Higher → More bonds/cash
Tax Situation        Affects vehicle selection
Human Capital        Stable → More stocks
Existing Assets      Concentrated? Diversify
```

### Time Horizon Framework

```
Years to Goal        Suggested Equity Range
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
0-2 years            0-20% (preserve capital)
3-5 years            20-40% (moderate growth)
6-10 years           40-60% (balanced)
11-20 years          60-80% (growth focus)
20+ years            70-90% (aggressive growth)

Rationale:
- Short term: Can't recover from losses
- Long term: Stocks' higher returns dominate
- Risk decreases with time (for stocks)
```

### Risk Tolerance Assessment

```
Risk Tolerance Questionnaire Elements:

1. Reaction to Losses
   How would you react to 20% portfolio drop?
   a) Sell everything
   b) Sell some
   c) Do nothing
   d) Buy more

2. Return Expectations
   Which portfolio would you prefer?
   a) +5% to +10% range
   b) 0% to +15% range
   c) -10% to +25% range
   d) -20% to +40% range

3. Experience
   How long have you been investing?
   Have you experienced a major decline?
   How did you react?

4. Knowledge
   How well do you understand investment risks?
   Can you tolerate short-term volatility?

Scoring:
- Conservative: More bonds, fewer stocks
- Moderate: Balanced approach
- Aggressive: More stocks, fewer bonds
```

### Risk Capacity Assessment

```
Risk Capacity (Ability to Take Risk):

High Capacity:                Low Capacity:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Long time horizon             Short time horizon
Stable income                 Variable income
High wealth                   Limited wealth
Flexible spending             Fixed obligations
No dependents                 Many dependents
High earning potential        Limited earning potential

Key Insight:
Allocate based on LOWER of:
- Risk tolerance (willingness)
- Risk capacity (ability)

A conservative investor with high capacity → Conservative
An aggressive investor with low capacity → Conservative
```

---

## Life-Cycle Investing

### The Human Capital Concept

```
Human Capital: Present value of future earnings

Age 25:
├── Human capital: Very large (~$2-3M PV)
├── Financial capital: Small (~$10K)
├── Human capital = "Bond-like" (stable salary)
└── Financial portfolio can be aggressive

Age 55:
├── Human capital: Diminished (~$500K PV)
├── Financial capital: Large (~$1M)
├── Less human capital to recover losses
└── Financial portfolio should be more conservative

Implication: Decrease stock allocation as you age
```

### Age-Based Rules of Thumb

```
Traditional Rule: Bonds = Age

Age 30: 30% bonds, 70% stocks
Age 50: 50% bonds, 50% stocks
Age 70: 70% bonds, 30% stocks

Updated Rule (longer lifespans): Bonds = Age - 20

Age 30: 10% bonds, 90% stocks
Age 50: 30% bonds, 70% stocks
Age 70: 50% bonds, 50% stocks

Personalized Approach:
Consider all factors, not just age
Rules are starting points, not mandates
```

### Target-Date Fund Glide Paths

```
Typical Glide Path:

Age    Stocks    Bonds    Cash    Alternative
────────────────────────────────────────────────
25      90%       10%      0%         0%
35      85%       15%      0%         0%
45      75%       20%      5%         0%
55      60%       30%     10%         0%
65      45%       40%     15%         0%
75      30%       50%     20%         0%
85      25%       55%     20%         0%

Note: Different providers use different glide paths
"To" retirement vs. "Through" retirement approaches
```

### Glide Path Considerations

```
"To" Retirement:
- Most conservative at retirement date
- Risk then stays constant
- Assumes spending at retirement

"Through" Retirement:
- Continues de-risking after retirement
- Reaches most conservative 10-15 years post-retirement
- Accounts for 30+ year retirement

Which is Better?
- "Through" for most retirees (longer time horizon)
- "To" if planning major purchase at retirement
- Custom glide path is ideal
```

## Rebalancing

### Why Rebalance?

```
Drift Problem:
Portfolio starts: 60% stocks, 40% bonds

After Bull Market:
- Stocks appreciated 30%
- Bonds appreciated 5%
- New allocation: 68% stocks, 32% bonds

Risk has increased beyond original intent!

Rebalancing:
- Sells winners (stocks)
- Buys losers (bonds)
- Returns to target allocation
- Maintains risk level
```

### Rebalancing Strategies

```
Calendar Rebalancing:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Frequency: Monthly, quarterly, or annually
Action: Rebalance regardless of drift amount
Pros: Simple, disciplined
Cons: May trade too often or too little

Threshold (Percentage-of-Portfolio) Rebalancing:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule: Rebalance when asset class drifts >5% from target
Example: Target 60% stocks → Rebalance at 55% or 65%
Pros: Rebalances when needed
Cons: Requires monitoring

Threshold-Band (Percentage-of-Asset) Rebalancing:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rule: Rebalance when asset class is ±25% from target
Example: Target 10% emerging → Rebalance at 7.5% or 12.5%
Pros: More responsive for small allocations
Cons: More complex

Hybrid Approach:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Review quarterly, rebalance if threshold exceeded
Best of both: Regular monitoring, trade only when needed
```

### Rebalancing Considerations

```
Factor              Implication
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Transaction costs   Wider bands in taxable accounts
Tax implications    Use new contributions if possible
Opportunity cost    Don't be too aggressive
Account type        Tax-loss harvest in taxable
Behavioral          Removes emotion from decision

Tax-Efficient Rebalancing:
1. Direct new contributions to underweight assets
2. Reinvest dividends into underweight assets
3. Rebalance in tax-advantaged accounts first
4. Tax-loss harvest when selling in taxable
5. Avoid short-term gains
```

### Rebalancing Math

```
Example:
Target: 60% stocks ($600K), 40% bonds ($400K)
Total: $1,000,000

After Drift:
Stocks: $720,000 (68%)
Bonds: $360,000 (32%)
Total: $1,080,000

New Targets:
Stocks: $1,080,000 × 60% = $648,000
Bonds: $1,080,000 × 40% = $432,000

Trades:
Sell stocks: $720,000 - $648,000 = $72,000
Buy bonds: $432,000 - $360,000 = $72,000
```

---

## Special Situations

### Executive Asset Allocation

```
Consideration: Concentrated company stock

Wrong Approach:
60/40 portfolio + company stock as "additional"
Reality: 60% stocks + company = much higher equity

Correct Approach:
Count company stock as part of equity allocation
Reduce other equity to compensate
Or: Exclude company stock, diversify separately

Example:
$2M portfolio, $500K in company stock

Wrong: 60/40 on $2M = $1.2M stocks + $500K company = 85% equity
Right: Company ($500K) + Other stocks ($700K) = $1.2M equity
       Bonds = $800K
       Total = 60/40 including company stock
```

### Concentrated Position Management

```
Strategies:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Systematic Sales (10b5-1 Plan)
- Regular sales on schedule
- Removes timing decision
- Pre-determined

Exchange Funds
- Contribute stock to diversified fund
- Receive diversified portfolio
- Defer capital gains
- 7-year lock-up typically

Hedging
- Options strategies
- Collars (caps upside, protects downside)
- Prepaid forwards
- Complex, costly

Charitable Giving
- Donate appreciated stock
- Avoid capital gains
- Receive deduction
- Donor-advised funds popular
```

### Retirement Allocation

```
Retirement Portfolio Considerations:

1. Spending needs
   - Determine annual withdrawal rate
   - Match fixed income to fixed expenses
   - Growth assets for inflation protection

2. Bucket Strategy
   Bucket 1 (0-2 years): Cash, money market
   Bucket 2 (3-7 years): Bonds, stable value
   Bucket 3 (8+ years): Stocks, growth assets

3. Floor-and-Upside
   Floor: Guaranteed income (SS, pension, annuity)
   Upside: Growth portfolio for discretionary spending

4. Liability-Driven Investing
   Match bond duration to spending horizon
   Immunize fixed spending needs
   Invest remainder for growth
```

## Common Mistakes

### Allocation Errors

```
Mistake                          Solution
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
100% equities near retirement    Match allocation to timeline
All bonds for 20-year goal       Accept volatility for growth
Ignoring human capital           Include in total wealth
Separate allocations per goal    Holistic portfolio view
Home equity = "diversified"      Concentrated real estate
Company stock not counted        Include in equity allocation
```

### Behavioral Mistakes

```
Mistake                          Solution
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Chasing recent performance       Stick to strategic allocation
Abandoning plan in crisis        Write Investment Policy Statement
Frequent changes                 Set rebalancing rules
Overconfidence in timing         Systematic rebalancing
Anchoring to purchase prices     Focus on current allocation
```

## Worked Example

### Comprehensive Asset Allocation

**Client Profile:**

```
Name: Sarah Chen
Age: 42
Goal: Retirement at 62 ($8M target)
Current Portfolio: $1.5M
Annual Savings: $80K
Company Stock: $400K (concentrated)
Risk Tolerance: Moderate-high
Time Horizon: 20 years
```

**Analysis:**

```
Step 1: Determine Appropriate Allocation

Time horizon: 20 years → 70-85% equity appropriate
Risk tolerance: Moderate-high → Supports equity
Risk capacity: High income, long horizon → High

Recommendation: 75% equity, 25% fixed income

Step 2: Account for Company Stock

Company stock: $400K = 27% of portfolio
Problem: Double-counting as equity

Solution:
Target equity: 75% × $1.5M = $1,125,000
Company stock: $400,000 (will reduce over time)
Other equity: $725,000
Fixed income: $375,000

Step 3: Design Allocation

                        Amount      % of Total
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Company Stock           $400,000    26.7%
US Large Cap            $325,000    21.7%
US Small Cap            $125,000     8.3%
International Dev.      $175,000    11.7%
Emerging Markets        $100,000     6.7%
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Equity          $1,125,000    75.0%
────────────────────────────────────────────────
US Aggregate Bonds      $275,000    18.3%
TIPS                    $100,000     6.7%
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Fixed Income      $375,000    25.0%
────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL                 $1,500,000   100.0%

Step 4: Plan for Company Stock Diversification

10b5-1 Plan: Sell $50K/quarter until company stock < 10%
Timeline: ~6-7 years to reach target
Reallocate proceeds to underweight areas
```

**Glide Path Design:**

```
Sarah's Custom Glide Path:

Age    Stocks    Bonds    Company Stock (target)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
42      75%       25%     27% (reducing)
47      70%       30%     10%
52      65%       35%      5%
57      55%       45%      0%
62      45%       55%      0%
67      40%       60%      0%

Annual Adjustment: Reduce equity ~1% per year
Rebalancing: Quarterly review, 5% threshold
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Asset allocation drives 90% of returns** - Most important decision
2. **Match allocation to time horizon** - Longer = more equity
3. **Lower of tolerance vs. capacity** - Don't exceed either
4. **Human capital matters** - Include in total wealth
5. **Rebalance systematically** - Calendar or threshold
6. **Count company stock** - It's concentrated equity
7. **Glide paths reduce risk over time** - Personalize for your situation
8. **Keep it simple** - Complex isn't always better

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Asset Allocation Design
Client age 55, plans to retire at 65. $2M portfolio, moderate risk tolerance. Design appropriate allocation with rationale.

### Problem 2: Rebalancing
Portfolio target: 70/30. After year: Stocks $840K (72%), Bonds $320K (28%). Total $1.16M. Calculate trades needed to rebalance.

### Problem 3: Company Stock
Executive has $3M portfolio with $1.2M (40%) in company stock. Target: 10% max company stock. Design 5-year diversification plan.
