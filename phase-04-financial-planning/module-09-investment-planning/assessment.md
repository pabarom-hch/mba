## Answer Key

### Section 1: Asset Classes and Fundamentals

**Answer 1.1 (6 points):**

| Asset Class | Expected Return | Risk (Volatility) | Correlation w/ US Large Cap |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| US Small Cap | 10-12% | 20-25% | 0.80-0.90 (high) |
| IG Bonds | 4-6% | 4-7% | -0.05 to 0.10 (low/negative) |
| EM Stocks | 10-12% | 25-35% | 0.65-0.80 (high) |

(2 points per asset class for accurate characterization)

**Answer 1.2 (4 points):**
```
Tax-Equivalent Yield = Municipal Yield / (1 - Tax Rate)
Tax-Equivalent = 4.2% / (1 - 0.35)
Tax-Equivalent = 4.2% / 0.65
Tax-Equivalent = 6.46%

Conclusion: Municipal bond (6.46% tax-equivalent) beats
corporate bond (6.0%). Choose municipal.

(2 points for correct formula and calculation, 2 points for conclusion)
```

**Answer 1.3 (5 points):**
```
Duration: Measure of a bond's price sensitivity to interest rate changes
Practical significance:
- Higher duration = greater interest rate risk
- Used to match assets to liabilities
- Key input for fixed income portfolio management

Price Change Calculation:
Price Change ≈ -Duration × Change in Yield
Price Change ≈ -6 × 1.25%
Price Change ≈ -7.5%

(2 points for definition, 3 points for calculation)
```

**Answer 1.4 (5 points):**
Three portfolio benefits of commodities (any three):
1. **Inflation hedge** - Commodity prices typically rise with inflation
2. **Diversification** - Low/negative correlation to stocks and bonds
3. **Currency hedge** - Priced in dollars, benefit from dollar weakness
4. **Crisis protection** - May perform well during geopolitical events
5. **Real asset exposure** - Tangible asset with intrinsic value

(1.67 points per benefit with explanation)

### Section 2: Modern Portfolio Theory

**Answer 2.1 (8 points):**

a) Expected Portfolio Return (2 points):
```
E(Rp) = wA × E(RA) + wB × E(RB)
E(Rp) = 0.60 × 12% + 0.40 × 8%
E(Rp) = 7.2% + 3.2% = 10.4%
```

b) Portfolio Standard Deviation (4 points):
```
σp² = wA²σA² + wB²σB² + 2wAwBρABσAσB
σp² = (0.60)²(22%)² + (0.40)²(14%)² + 2(0.60)(0.40)(0.35)(22%)(14%)
σp² = 0.36(484) + 0.16(196) + 2(0.60)(0.40)(0.35)(308)
σp² = 174.24 + 31.36 + 51.74
σp² = 257.34
σp = √257.34 = 16.04%
```

c) Comparison (2 points):
```
Weighted average risk = 0.60(22%) + 0.40(14%) = 18.8%
Actual portfolio risk = 16.04%
Diversification benefit = 18.8% - 16.04% = 2.76%

The portfolio has lower risk than weighted average due to
imperfect correlation (diversification benefit).
```

**Answer 2.2 (6 points):**
```
CAPM: E(Ri) = Rf + β × [E(Rm) - Rf]

Required Return:
E(R) = 4% + 1.4 × (9% - 4%)
E(R) = 4% + 1.4 × 5%
E(R) = 4% + 7% = 11%

Analysis:
Required return: 11%
Analyst projection: 11%
Conclusion: FAIRLY PRICED

The stock plots exactly on the Security Market Line.
Expected return equals required return.

(3 points for calculation, 3 points for analysis)
```

**Answer 2.3 (6 points):**
Three limitations with solutions (2 points each):

1. **Assumption: Normal return distribution**
   - Reality: Returns have fat tails and skewness
   - Solution: Use scenario analysis, stress testing, consider tail risk

2. **Assumption: Constant correlations**
   - Reality: Correlations spike during market crises
   - Solution: Model correlation changes, stress test with crisis correlations

3. **Assumption: Historical data predicts future**
   - Reality: Regimes change, estimates are uncertain
   - Solution: Use Bayesian shrinkage, constrain weights, robust optimization

Other acceptable answers: single-period optimization, no transaction costs, rational investors

### Section 3: Asset Allocation and Portfolio Construction

**Answer 3.1 (6 points):**
```
Client Profile Analysis:
- Time horizon: 7 years to retirement, then 25+ years
- Risk: Moderate tolerance
- No immediate liquidity needs
- Age suggests reducing equity gradually

Recommended Allocation:
────────────────────────────────
US Large Cap Equity      30%
US Small/Mid Cap          5%
International Developed  15%
Emerging Markets          5%
────────────────────────────────
Total Equity             55%
────────────────────────────────
Investment Grade Bonds   30%
TIPS                     10%
Cash                      5%
────────────────────────────────
Total Fixed Income       45%
────────────────────────────────

Rationale:
- 55% equity appropriate for moderate risk with 7+ year horizon
- International provides diversification
- TIPS protect purchasing power
- Bond allocation reduces volatility as retirement approaches
- Glide down to 45% equity at retirement

(3 points for reasonable allocation, 3 points for rationale)
```

**Answer 3.2 (6 points):**
```
Optimal Asset Location:

401(k) - $500,000 (Tax-Deferred):
- Bonds: $350,000 (all bonds)
- TIPS: $50,000 (all TIPS)
- US Equity Index: $100,000 (remainder)

Rationale: Place tax-inefficient assets (bonds generate
ordinary income) in tax-deferred account.

Roth IRA - $150,000 (Tax-Free):
- US Equity Index: $150,000

Rationale: Place highest expected growth in tax-free
account to maximize benefit of tax-free growth.

Taxable - $350,000:
- US Equity Index: $350,000

Rationale: Tax-efficient equity (low turnover, LTCG)
in taxable account.

Summary:
- Bonds/TIPS in 401(k) (taxable interest sheltered)
- Growth assets in Roth (tax-free growth)
- Tax-efficient equity in taxable

(2 points per account with correct rationale)
```

**Answer 3.3 (4 points):**
```
a) Current Allocation (2 points):
Total: $840K + $280K = $1,120,000
Stocks: $840K / $1,120K = 75%
Bonds: $280K / $1,120K = 25%

b) Rebalancing Trades (2 points):
Target Stocks: 70% × $1,120K = $784,000
Target Bonds: 30% × $1,120K = $336,000

Current Stocks: $840,000 → Sell $56,000
Current Bonds: $280,000 → Buy $56,000

Trade: Sell $56,000 stocks, buy $56,000 bonds
```

**Answer 3.4 (4 points):**
```
Passive Management:
- Tracks index, minimizes costs
- Lower fees (0.03%-0.20%)
- Tax efficient

Active Management:
- Attempts to outperform benchmark
- Higher fees (0.50%-1.50%)
- Manager skill dependent

When Active May Be Appropriate:
- Less efficient markets (small cap, EM, high yield)
- Tax-loss harvesting strategies
- Specific client constraints (ESG)

Evidence on Active Performance:
SPIVA research shows 85-97% of active managers
underperform their benchmark over 15-year periods.
After fees, active management is generally a
losing proposition for most investors.

(2 points for comparison, 2 points for evidence)

### Section 4: Investment Policy Statements

**Answer 4.1 (8 points):**

**Return Objective (4 points):**
```
Analysis:
- Spending need: $140,000/year
- Current assets: $3,800,000
- Withdrawal rate needed: $140K / $3.8M = 3.7%
- Social Security starts in 5-7 years: $55K
- After SS: Need $85K from portfolio (2.2%)

Return Objective:
"The portfolio seeks to achieve an average annual
total return of 5-6% over rolling 10-year periods,
sufficient to:
• Support annual spending of $140,000 (adjusted for
  inflation) until Social Security begins
• Maintain purchasing power over 30+ year horizon
• Preserve real value of portfolio principal"
```

**Risk Objective (4 points):**
```
Risk Assessment:
- Ability: Moderate (30-year horizon, but spending needs)
- Willingness: Moderate-conservative
- Overall: Moderate-conservative

Risk Objective:
"The portfolio should target annual volatility of
8-12%. Maximum acceptable drawdown during market
corrections is 20%. The portfolio should be
constructed to minimize sequence-of-returns risk
given ongoing distributions.

The clients have moderate-conservative risk tolerance
reflecting their need for portfolio income and
discomfort with significant volatility. Asset
allocation should prioritize stability while
maintaining sufficient growth to combat inflation."
```

**Answer 4.2 (7 points):**
Three constraints (2.33 points each):

**1. Time Horizon:**
```
"The foundation has a perpetual time horizon,
seeking to provide grants indefinitely. Investment
strategy should balance current grant obligations
with long-term preservation of purchasing power."
```

**2. Liquidity:**
```
"The foundation requires $2.5 million annually for
grants (5% of assets). An additional 6-month reserve
($1.25M) should be maintained in liquid investments
to ensure grant obligations can be met during
market downturns."
```

**3. Unique Circumstances (ESG Restrictions):**
```
"Investments in tobacco companies and firearms
manufacturers are prohibited, consistent with the
foundation's mission and donor intent. Negative
screens will be applied to both direct holdings
and fund investments."
```

Additional acceptable constraints:
- Legal/Regulatory (state requirements, UPMIFA)
- Tax considerations (foundation excise taxes)
- Governance (family board dynamics)

### Section 5: Alternative Investments

**Answer 5.1 (5 points):**
```
J-Curve Effect:
The pattern where private equity fund returns are
initially negative before turning positive.

Why It Occurs:
1. Years 1-3: Capital called but not fully invested
2. Management fees charged on committed capital
3. Investments marked at cost (no appreciation)
4. Exit activity minimal
5. Portfolio companies still in development

How to Plan:
1. Cash flow planning: Have liquid assets for capital calls
2. Multiple vintages: Stagger PE commitments over time
3. Set expectations: Don't evaluate PE on early returns
4. Secondary funds: Can reduce J-curve (buy seasoned positions)
5. Patience: Allow 5-7 years before judging performance

(2 points for explanation, 3 points for planning)
```

**Answer 5.2 (5 points):**
```
PE Fund Return Calculation:

Investment: $1,000,000
Gross MOIC: 2.5x
Gross proceeds: $2,500,000
Holding period: 5 years

Management Fee Drag:
2% × $1M × 5 years = $100,000 (simplified)

Proceeds after management: $2,500,000 - $100,000 = $2,400,000

Carried Interest Calculation:
Preferred return: 8% annually on $1M ≈ $470,000 (compound)
Investor receives: $1,000,000 + $470,000 = $1,470,000 first
Remaining: $2,400,000 - $1,470,000 = $930,000
Carry (20% of profits): $930,000 × 20% = $186,000
GP receives: $186,000
LP receives remaining: $930,000 - $186,000 = $744,000

Total LP receives: $1,470,000 + $744,000 = $2,214,000

Net MOIC: $2,214,000 / $1,000,000 = 2.21x
Net IRR: Approximately 17% (vs. ~20% gross)

Note: This is simplified; actual calculations more complex

(3 points for methodology, 2 points for reasonable answer)
```

### Section 6: Executive Investment Challenges

**Answer 6.1 (5 points):**
```
Company-Related Assets:
Vested company stock:     $1,800,000
Unvested RSUs:            $  600,000
Vested options (spread):  $  400,000
Deferred compensation:    $  300,000
────────────────────────────────────
Total company-related:    $3,100,000

Non-Company Assets:
401(k) diversified:       $  700,000
Cash:                     $  200,000
────────────────────────────────────
Total non-company:        $  900,000

Total Net Worth:          $4,000,000

Concentration Percentage:
$3,100,000 / $4,000,000 = 77.5%

Assessment:
This is HIGHLY CONCERNING. 77.5% concentration in
single company represents severe risk. Additionally,
income (human capital) is tied to same company.

Target:
Should reduce company stock to <10% of investable
assets over 3-5 years through systematic
diversification (10b5-1 plan).

(3 points for calculation, 2 points for assessment)
```

**Answer 6.2 (5 points):**
```
10b5-1 Plan Definition:
A written plan for trading company securities that:
• Is established when NOT in possession of MNPI
• Specifies amount, price, and dates in advance
• Provides affirmative defense to insider trading

Three Best Practices:

1. Establish During Open Windows
   Create plan only when trading window is open and
   no material non-public information exists.

2. Use Meaningful Cooling-Off Period
   Wait 90+ days (now required for executives) between
   establishing plan and first trade. Demonstrates
   good faith.

3. Avoid Frequent Modifications
   Don't cancel, modify, or replace plans frequently.
   Makes plan appear opportunistic rather than
   systematic.

Other acceptable: Extended timeframe, documentation,
legal counsel involvement, single plan at a time

(2 points for definition, 3 points for best practices)
```

**Answer 6.3 (5 points):**
```
Three Behavioral Biases and Solutions:

1. Overconfidence
   Bias: "I know this company better than anyone"
   Reality: Insider knowledge ≠ stock prediction ability
   Solution: Systematic 10b5-1 plan removes timing
   decision. Pre-commit to diversification schedule
   regardless of personal market views.

2. Endowment Effect
   Bias: "This stock made me wealthy, it's special"
   Reality: Past returns don't reduce current risk
   Solution: Ask "Would I buy this position today?"
   If no, sell. Separate emotional attachment from
   financial decision.

3. Anchoring
   Bias: "I'll sell when it gets back to $100"
   Reality: Purchase price is irrelevant to current value
   Solution: Evaluate based on current fundamentals and
   diversification needs. Ignore historical prices
   in sell decisions.

Other acceptable: Loss aversion, status quo bias,
familiarity bias

(1.67 points per bias with solution)
