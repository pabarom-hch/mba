## Key Frameworks

### Retirement Planning Process

```
1. Define Retirement Vision
   ├── When? (retirement age)
   ├── Where? (location, housing)
   ├── What? (activities, travel, work)
   └── How much? (lifestyle expectations)

2. Calculate Income Needs
   ├── Replacement ratio approach
   ├── Detailed expense projection
   └── Stress testing for uncertainties

3. Inventory Resources
   ├── Social Security (both spouses)
   ├── Pensions and annuities
   ├── Retirement accounts
   ├── Taxable investments
   └── Other income sources

4. Gap Analysis
   ├── Income needs vs. guaranteed income
   ├── Portfolio required to fill gap
   └── Accumulation requirements

5. Design Strategy
   ├── Accumulation plan (if still working)
   ├── Claiming strategies (Social Security)
   ├── Distribution sequence
   └── Tax optimization
```

### The Three-Legged Stool

```
Traditional Retirement Security:

       ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
       │    RETIREMENT SECURITY          │
       └────────────┬────────────────────┘
                    │
    ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
    │               │               │
    ▼               ▼               ▼
┌────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│ Social │    │ Employer │    │ Personal │
│Security│    │ Pension  │    │ Savings  │
└────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘

Modern Reality:
- Social Security: Reduced benefits likely
- Pensions: Mostly eliminated (except public sector)
- Personal Savings: Bears most of burden
```

## Critical Concepts

### The 4% Rule

```
Original Research (Bengen, 1994):
- Withdraw 4% of initial portfolio in year 1
- Adjust for inflation each subsequent year
- 30-year success rate: 95%+ historically

Example:
$2,000,000 portfolio
Year 1 withdrawal: $80,000 (4%)
Year 2 withdrawal: $82,400 (3% inflation)
Year 3 withdrawal: $84,872 (3% inflation)

Modern Considerations:
- Lower expected returns suggest 3-3.5%
- Flexibility increases sustainability
- Guardrails can extend portfolio life
```

### Sequence of Returns Risk

```
The order of returns matters in retirement:

Scenario A: Good returns first, bad returns later
Scenario B: Bad returns first, good returns later

With SAME average return, Scenario B fails more often

Why?
- Bad early returns + withdrawals = smaller base
- Less to compound when good years arrive
- Portfolio may not recover

Mitigation:
- Cash buffer (2-3 years expenses)
- Flexible spending in down markets
- Balanced allocation
- Avoid forced selling at lows
```

## Executive Applications

### CEO Retirement Priorities

1. **Optimize equity vesting** - Time retirement to maximize compensation
2. **Manage deferred comp** - Distribution planning for tax efficiency
3. **Bridge healthcare** - COBRA or individual coverage to Medicare
4. **Define "retirement"** - Board service, consulting, new ventures
5. **Estate integration** - Wealth transfer and legacy planning

### Common Executive Retirement Mistakes

- Retiring before key equity tranches vest
- Ignoring deferred comp distribution elections
- Underestimating healthcare costs pre-Medicare
- Not planning for loss of perks (travel, support staff)
- Starting Social Security too early when wealth adequate

---

## Retirement Math Essentials

### Required Portfolio Size

```
Spending Need / Safe Withdrawal Rate = Required Portfolio

Example:
Retirement spending: $150,000
Social Security: $50,000
Gap: $100,000
Safe withdrawal rate: 4%

Required portfolio: $100,000 / 0.04 = $2,500,000
```

### Social Security Break-Even

```
Claiming at 62 vs. 70:
Monthly benefit at 62: $2,000
Monthly benefit at 70: $3,520

Cumulative comparison:
Age 77: 62 claiming catches up
Age 80+: 70 claiming ahead permanently

Break-even: ~12-14 years after claiming
If expected to live beyond break-even, delay
```
