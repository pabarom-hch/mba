## Introduction

Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) provide additional retirement savings opportunities beyond employer plans. The choice between Traditional and Roth IRAs, along with conversion strategies, can significantly impact after-tax wealth in retirement. For high earners, indirect contribution methods like backdoor Roth strategies are essential knowledge.

## Traditional vs. Roth IRAs

### Fundamental Differences

```
Traditional IRA:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Contributions: Pre-tax (deductible if eligible)
Growth: Tax-deferred
Withdrawals: Taxed as ordinary income
RMDs: Required at age 73
Best if: Tax rate higher now than in retirement

Roth IRA:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Contributions: After-tax (no deduction)
Growth: Tax-free
Withdrawals: Tax-free (if qualified)
RMDs: None during owner's lifetime
Best if: Tax rate lower now than in retirement
```

### 2024 Contribution Limits

```
Annual Contribution Limit:
Under 50: $7,000
Age 50+: $8,000 (catch-up)

Combined Limit:
Total Traditional + Roth cannot exceed $7,000/$8,000
(If contribute $4,000 to Traditional, max $3,000 to Roth)

Deadline:
Tax filing deadline (April 15 of following year)
Can contribute to 2024 IRA until April 15, 2025
```

### Eligibility and Income Limits

```
Traditional IRA Deductibility (2024):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
If covered by workplace plan:
Single: Phase-out $77,000 - $87,000 MAGI
MFJ: Phase-out $123,000 - $143,000 MAGI

If NOT covered, but spouse is:
MFJ: Phase-out $230,000 - $240,000 MAGI

If neither covered by workplace plan:
No income limit - fully deductible

Roth IRA Contribution Eligibility (2024):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Single: Phase-out $146,000 - $161,000 MAGI
MFJ: Phase-out $230,000 - $240,000 MAGI

Above limits: Cannot contribute directly
Solution: Backdoor Roth (discussed below)
```

---

## Backdoor Roth IRA

### The Strategy

```
Problem: High earners can't contribute directly to Roth

Solution: Backdoor Roth (2-step process)

Step 1: Contribute to non-deductible Traditional IRA
- No income limit on non-deductible contributions
- File Form 8606 to track basis

Step 2: Convert to Roth IRA
- No income limit on conversions
- If no pre-tax IRA money, minimal tax on conversion

Result:
After-tax money → Traditional IRA → Roth IRA
Effectively a Roth contribution for high earners
```

### The Pro-Rata Rule

```
Problem: If you have pre-tax IRA money

Pro-Rata Rule:
Conversion is proportionally taxed based on
total pre-tax vs. after-tax IRA balances

Example:
Pre-tax IRA (rollover from 401k): $95,000
Non-deductible contribution: $7,000
Total: $102,000

% Pre-tax: $95,000 / $102,000 = 93%
% After-tax: $7,000 / $102,000 = 7%

If convert $7,000:
Taxable: $7,000 × 93% = $6,510
Non-taxable: $7,000 × 7% = $490

Solution:
Roll pre-tax IRA INTO 401(k) before year-end
Then convert only after-tax basis
```

### Mega Backdoor Roth

```
For Those with 401(k) Plans That Allow:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Annual 401(k) limit (all sources): $69,000 (2024)
Employee deferral: $23,000
Employer match: Varies
Gap: Room for after-tax contributions

If plan allows:
1. Contribute after-tax to 401(k) up to annual limit
2. Convert to Roth (in-plan) or roll to Roth IRA

Example:
Employee deferral: $23,000
Employer match: $15,000
After-tax space: $69,000 - $38,000 = $31,000

$31,000 additional in Roth per year
Much more than $7,000 regular Roth limit!

Caveat: Not all 401(k) plans allow this
Check with HR/plan administrator
```

## Roth Conversions

### Roth Conversion Strategy

```
What: Move money from Traditional IRA to Roth IRA
Tax: Converted amount taxed as ordinary income
Benefit: Future growth and withdrawals are tax-free

When Conversions Make Sense:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Current tax bracket is low (temporary)
- Between retirement and Social Security
- Between job loss and new employment
- Market decline (convert more shares for same tax)
- Expect higher future tax rates
- Want to leave tax-free inheritance
- Avoid future RMDs
```

### Conversion Planning

```
Strategic Approach:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"Fill the bracket" - Convert up to top of current bracket

Example:
Married filing jointly, 2024
Current taxable income: $150,000
24% bracket tops at: $383,900
Room to convert: $233,900 and stay in 24% bracket

May convert $50,000-$100,000/year
Stay in 24% bracket
Over 10 years: $500K-$1M converted at 24%
vs. potentially 32%+ later with RMDs

Tax Payment:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ideal: Pay tax from non-IRA funds
If use IRA funds: Lose principal + potential growth
Under 59½: 10% penalty on tax portion from IRA
```

### Roth Conversion Analysis

```
Example:
$100,000 Traditional IRA
Current bracket: 24%
Expected retirement bracket: 32%
Time horizon: 20 years
Growth rate: 6%

Option A: Keep Traditional
Future value: $100,000 × (1.06)^20 = $320,714
After-tax (32%): $218,086

Option B: Convert to Roth
Tax now (24%): $24,000 (paid from other funds)
Future value: $100,000 × (1.06)^20 = $320,714
After-tax: $320,714 (tax-free)

Benefit of Conversion: $320,714 - $218,086 = $102,628
Plus: No RMDs, tax diversification, estate benefits
```

## Required Minimum Distributions

### RMD Basics

```
Applies To:
- Traditional IRAs
- 401(k), 403(b), 457 plans
- SEP and SIMPLE IRAs
- NOT Roth IRAs (during owner's lifetime)
- NOT Roth 401(k) starting 2024 (SECURE 2.0)

Start Date:
Age 73 (for those turning 73 in 2024+)
Age 75 (starting in 2033)

First RMD: April 1 of year following turning 73
(Subsequent RMDs: December 31 each year)

Penalty for Missing RMD:
25% of amount not distributed (was 50%)
Reduced to 10% if corrected within 2 years
```

### RMD Calculation

```
Formula:
RMD = Account Balance / Life Expectancy Factor

Use December 31 balance of prior year
Uniform Lifetime Table for most people

Example (Age 75):
IRA Balance: $1,000,000
Factor at 75: 24.6

RMD = $1,000,000 / 24.6 = $40,650

Must withdraw at least $40,650
Can withdraw more if needed
Taxed as ordinary income
```

### Uniform Lifetime Table (Partial)

```
Age     Factor     Approx % Withdrawal
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
73      26.5       3.77%
74      25.5       3.92%
75      24.6       4.07%
76      23.7       4.22%
77      22.9       4.37%
78      22.0       4.55%
79      21.1       4.74%
80      20.2       4.95%
85      16.0       6.25%
90      12.2       8.20%
95       8.9      11.24%
100      6.4      15.63%

Note: Percentages increase with age
Later RMDs can push into higher tax brackets
```

### RMD Strategies

```
Managing RMD Tax Impact:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Roth Conversions Before 73
   Convert pre-73 to reduce Traditional balance
   Smaller balance = smaller RMDs

2. Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)
   Donate up to $105,000 directly from IRA to charity
   Counts toward RMD but not taxable income
   Must be 70½ or older

3. Still-Working Exception
   If still employed at company with 401(k)
   Can delay RMDs from that plan (not IRAs)
   Must not own >5% of company

4. Spend Down Pre-73
   Withdraw from IRAs before RMDs begin
   If in lower bracket early retirement
```

## IRA Strategy by Life Stage

### Accumulation Phase (Working Years)

```
Priority Order:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. 401(k) to employer match
2. HSA (if eligible) - triple tax advantage
3. Max Roth IRA (or backdoor Roth)
4. Max 401(k)
5. Taxable investing

Roth vs. Traditional Choice:
- Early career (low income): Roth usually better
- Peak earning years: Traditional often better
- Goal: Tax diversification (have both)
```

### Pre-Retirement (Ages 50-65)

```
Key Actions:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Maximize catch-up contributions
   401(k): +$7,500
   IRA: +$1,000

2. Evaluate Roth conversions
   If expect lower income before SS/RMDs
   Convert during "gap years"

3. Consolidate accounts
   Roll old 401(k)s to single IRA (or current 401k)
   Simplify management

4. Model RMD impact
   Project future RMDs
   Plan conversions accordingly
```

### Retirement Phase

```
Distribution Sequence:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
General Order (tax efficiency):
1. Taxable accounts (lowest tax, preserves IRA)
2. Traditional IRA (ordinary income)
3. Roth IRA (tax-free, save for last)

Adjust Based On:
- Tax bracket management
- RMD requirements
- Estate planning goals
- Social Security taxation
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Roth vs. Traditional** - Consider current vs. future tax rates
2. **Backdoor Roth works** - For high earners above income limits
3. **Watch pro-rata rule** - Clear pre-tax IRAs first
4. **Conversions are powerful** - Especially in low-income years
5. **RMDs start at 73** - Plan to minimize impact
6. **QCDs for charitably inclined** - Satisfy RMD without tax
7. **Tax diversification** - Have both Traditional and Roth
8. **Mega backdoor Roth** - If 401(k) allows, big opportunity

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Backdoor Roth
Client has $300,000 Traditional IRA (all pre-tax) and wants to do backdoor Roth. Options?

### Problem 2: Roth Conversion
Couple retiring at 60, Social Security at 67. Current bracket 22%, will be 32% with SS and RMDs. Design conversion strategy.

### Problem 3: RMD Calculation
Client age 76, $2,000,000 combined Traditional IRAs. Calculate RMD. If charitably inclined, what's the QCD strategy?
