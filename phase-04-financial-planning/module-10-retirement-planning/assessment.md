## Answer Key

### Section 1: Retirement Needs Analysis

**Answer 1.1 (6 points):**
```
Current Situation:
Income: $280,000
Savings (18%): -$50,400
FICA taxes: ~$20,000
Available for spending: $209,600

Annual mortgage: $96,000 (paid off at retirement)

Retirement Adjustment:
Current spending: $209,600 - savings captured = ~$210,000
Less mortgage: -$96,000
Plus healthcare increase: +$15,000 (estimate)
Adjusted retirement need: ~$130,000

Replacement Ratio: $130,000 / $280,000 = 46%

This seems low, but mortgage payoff is significant.
Add 10-15% buffer: $143,000-150,000 target

(3 points for calculation, 3 points for reasoning/adjustments)
```

**Answer 1.2 (5 points):**
```
Sequence of Returns Risk Definition:
The risk that poor investment returns early in retirement,
combined with withdrawals, permanently impairs the portfolio.

Why More Dangerous in Retirement:
- During accumulation: Bad years mean buying at low prices
- During distribution: Bad years + withdrawals = selling at lows
- Smaller base has less to compound when recovery occurs
- Cannot recover through future contributions

Two Mitigation Strategies (any two):
1. Cash buffer/bucket strategy - 2-3 years in cash
2. Flexible spending - reduce withdrawals in down markets
3. Delay Social Security - reduces early portfolio pressure
4. Conservative early allocation - lower equity first 5 years
5. Part-time work - income reduces withdrawal need

(2 points definition, 3 points strategies)
```

**Answer 1.3 (4 points):**
```
Retirement Spending Smile:
Spending pattern that starts high, decreases in middle
years, and may increase late in retirement.

Phases:
- Early (65-75): Active, travel, hobbies - HIGHER spending
- Middle (75-85): Activity decreases - LOWER spending
- Late (85+): Healthcare costs dominate - VARIABLE

Impact on Projections:
- Don't assume flat inflation-adjusted spending
- Budget more for early "go-go" years
- Allow for natural decline in "slow-go" years
- Reserve for healthcare in "no-go" years
- May allow higher early withdrawal if flexible

(2 points for explanation, 2 points for implications)

### Section 2: Social Security

**Answer 2.1 (8 points):**
```
PIA at FRA (67): $3,200

a) Claiming at 62 (60 months early):
First 36 months: 36 × 5/9% = 20% reduction
Next 24 months: 24 × 5/12% = 10% reduction
Total reduction: 30%
Benefit: $3,200 × 70% = $2,240/month

b) Claiming at 65 (24 months early):
First 24 months: 24 × 5/9% = 13.33% reduction
Total reduction: 13.33%
Benefit: $3,200 × 86.67% = $2,773/month

c) Claiming at 70 (36 months delayed):
Delayed retirement credits: 36 × 0.67% = 24% increase
Benefit: $3,200 × 124% = $3,968/month

(2-3 points per calculation with correct methodology)
```

**Answer 2.2 (6 points):**
```
Spousal Benefit Rules:
- Maximum spousal benefit = 50% of higher earner's PIA
- Receive higher of own benefit or spousal benefit

Calculation:
Maria's own PIA: $1,100
Husband's PIA: $3,400
Maximum spousal: 50% × $3,400 = $1,700

Since $1,700 > $1,100, Maria receives spousal benefit.

Technical Detail:
Maria receives her own $1,100 PLUS spousal "top-up" of $600
Total: $1,700/month

(3 points for rules, 3 points for correct calculation)
```

**Answer 2.3 (6 points):**
```
Recommended Strategy:
Husband delays to 70, Wife claims at FRA (65)

Rationale:
1. Husband is higher earner ($3,000 PIA)
   - At 70: $3,000 × 124% = $3,720
   - Creates largest survivor benefit

2. Wife claims at 65 (or 67 at FRA)
   - Provides bridge income while husband delays
   - Her benefit: ~$1,200 (or less if claiming early)

3. With $1.5M savings:
   - Can afford to bridge 2 years
   - Husband's delay "buys" 8%/year increase
   - Essentially 24% more guaranteed income for life

4. Survivor Protection:
   - If husband dies first, wife gets $3,720 (vs. $3,000)
   - 24% more survivor benefit

Bridge Period:
Wife's SS + Portfolio withdrawals cover 2 years
Worth the wait for higher lifetime income

(3 points for strategy, 3 points for sound rationale)

### Section 3: Employer Retirement Plans

**Answer 3.1 (6 points):**
```
a) 401(k) Employee Deferrals (2024):
Under 50: $23,000
Age 50+: $23,000 + $7,500 catch-up = $30,500

b) Total Annual Additions (Employee + Employer):
Under 50: $69,000
Age 50+: $69,000 + $7,500 = $76,500
(Includes employee deferrals, employer match, employer
profit sharing, and after-tax contributions)

c) 457 Plan Difference:
457 plans are NOT aggregated with 401(k)
Can contribute $23,000 to EACH (plus catch-up)
Government employee could contribute:
$23,000 (401k) + $23,000 (457) = $46,000
+ catch-up contributions if 50+

(2 points per section)
```

**Answer 3.2 (8 points):**
```
NUA Strategy Explanation:
Distribute appreciated employer stock to taxable account.
Pay ordinary income ONLY on cost basis.
Future appreciation taxed at LTCG rates.

Calculation:
Stock value: $400,000
Cost basis: $50,000
NUA (Net Unrealized Appreciation): $350,000

Option A: Roll to IRA, Withdraw Later
All withdrawals taxed as ordinary income
$400,000 × 35% = $140,000 tax (eventually)

Option B: NUA Strategy
Immediate tax on basis: $50,000 × 35% = $17,500
Tax on NUA if sell: $350,000 × 23.8% = $83,300
Total tax: $100,800

Potential Savings: $140,000 - $100,800 = $39,200

When NUA Makes Sense:
- Large appreciation (low basis)
- Plan to sell relatively soon
- High ordinary income bracket
- Lower capital gains bracket
- Don't need to hold for estate step-up

Caveat: At age 58, 10% early withdrawal penalty would
apply to NUA portion if sold before 59½
(Add $35,000 penalty, still may be beneficial)

(3 points for explanation, 3 points for calculation,
2 points for "when makes sense")
```

**Answer 3.3 (6 points):**
```
Three Key Risks of NQDC:

1. Company Credit Risk
   - NQDC is unsecured promise to pay
   - If company goes bankrupt, become general creditor
   - Could lose entire balance
   - Already have salary tied to company

2. Lack of Flexibility
   - 409A rules require irrevocable elections
   - Cannot change distribution timing once elected
   - May not align with actual retirement date
   - Life circumstances may change

3. Tax Rate Uncertainty
   - Tax rates may be higher when distributed
   - Cannot predict future tax environment
   - May not achieve intended deferral benefit
   - Large distributions spike income

Consideration Factors:
- Company financial health (credit rating)
- Total company exposure (salary + stock + NQDC)
- Confidence in election timing
- Alternative savings vehicles available
- Current vs. expected future tax bracket

(2 points per risk)
```

### Section 4: IRAs and Distributions

**Answer 4.1 (6 points):**
```
Backdoor Roth IRA Strategy:

What: Two-step process to contribute to Roth despite income limits
1. Contribute to non-deductible Traditional IRA
2. Convert immediately to Roth IRA

When Necessary:
- Income exceeds Roth direct contribution limits
  Single: >$161,000, MFJ: >$240,000 (2024)
- Want Roth benefits (tax-free growth/withdrawals)

Pro-Rata Rule:
- Conversion tax based on ALL Traditional IRA assets
- Percentage taxable = Pre-tax balance / Total IRA balance
- Example: $100K pre-tax IRA, $7K contribution
  Tax on conversion = 93% of $7K = $6,510 taxable

Avoiding Pro-Rata:
- Roll pre-tax IRA into 401(k) before year-end
- Only after-tax basis remains
- Conversion then mostly tax-free

(2 points each for strategy, when necessary, pro-rata)
```

**Answer 4.2 (8 points):**
```
Roth Conversion Strategy:

Analysis:
Current age: 62, SS at 67
Traditional IRA: $1,500,000
Current taxable income: $50,000
Current bracket: 22% (tops at $94,300 for single, or ~$190,500 MFJ)

Gap Years (62-67): Low income, low bracket
Opportunity: Convert aggressively before SS and RMDs

Conversion Window:
5 years × "room" in 22% bracket

If MFJ (assume married):
22% bracket room: $201,050 - $50,000 = $151,050

Recommended Annual Conversion:
Convert $100,000-$120,000/year for 5 years
Stay in 22% bracket
Total converted: $500,000-$600,000

Tax Cost:
$100,000 × 22% = $22,000/year × 5 = $110,000 total

Future Benefit:
$500K+ in Roth, grows tax-free
Reduces Traditional IRA to ~$1M at 67
Lower RMDs
SS taxation reduced

Comparison:
Without conversions: RMDs + SS push to 32%+
$100K RMD × 32% = $32,000/year tax
Savings: 10% × converted amount over time

(4 points for strategy, 4 points for calculation/reasoning)
```

**Answer 4.3 (6 points):**
```
RMD Calculation:
IRA Balance: $1,800,000
Age: 76
Factor: 23.7

RMD = $1,800,000 / 23.7 = $75,949

Must withdraw at least $75,949
Taxed as ordinary income

QCD Strategy (Qualified Charitable Distribution):
If charitably inclined, donate up to $105,000 directly to charity

Recommended:
- Donate $75,949 via QCD (or less if not that charitable)
- QCD counts toward RMD
- Excluded from taxable income
- Better than deducting donation (may not itemize)

Example:
Standard deduction: $30,700 (MFJ 65+)
If RMD taken and donated: $75,949 income - $30,700 = $45,249 taxable
If QCD: $0 taxable from this portion

Tax savings: $45,249 × 22-24% = ~$10,000+

(3 points for RMD calculation, 3 points for QCD strategy)
```

### Section 5: Distribution Strategies

**Answer 5.1 (5 points):**
```
4% Rule:
Withdraw 4% of initial portfolio value in year 1.
Adjust withdrawal for inflation each subsequent year.
Based on Bengen (1994) research showing 95%+ success
over 30-year historical periods.

Two Modern Criticisms:

1. Based on Historical Returns
   - Future returns may be lower
   - Bond yields historically higher than today
   - Some suggest 3-3.5% more appropriate now

   Practitioner Response:
   - Use dynamic spending rules
   - Adjust withdrawal based on portfolio performance
   - "Guardrails" approach

2. Ignores Flexibility
   - Assumes constant (inflation-adjusted) spending
   - Real retirees can adjust spending
   - Too rigid in down markets

   Practitioner Response:
   - Floor-and-upside strategy
   - Flexible spending within bands
   - Cut discretionary in bad years, increase in good

(2 points for explanation, 1.5 points per criticism/response)
```

**Answer 5.2 (6 points):**
```
Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Sequence:

Given:
Need: $90,000
SS: $35,000 (85% taxable = $29,750)
22% bracket top: $201,050 (MFJ)
Accounts: Trad IRA $800K, Roth $200K, Taxable $300K

Step 1: Calculate taxable income capacity
Available in 22% bracket: $201,050
SS taxable: $29,750
Room for other taxable income: $171,300

Step 2: Design withdrawals
Need from portfolio: $90,000 - $35,000 = $55,000

Strategy:
Traditional IRA: $55,000
- Creates $55,000 taxable income
- Combined with SS: $29,750 + $55,000 = $84,750
- Well within 22% bracket

Roth: $0 (save for later, tax-free growth)
Taxable: $0 (save for later, lower tax on gains)

Alternative Strategy:
Traditional IRA: $80,000 (fill more of bracket)
Taxable: $0
Roth: $0
Extra $25K to savings or Roth conversion
"Fill the bracket" approach

(3 points for correct sequence, 3 points for tax optimization)
```

**Answer 5.3 (4 points):**
```
Bucket Strategy:
Divide portfolio into time-segmented "buckets":

Bucket 1: Cash (0-3 years spending)
Bucket 2: Bonds (3-10 years)
Bucket 3: Stocks (10+ years)

Psychological Benefit:
- Provides peace of mind during volatility
- Know 2-3 years of expenses are "safe" in cash
- Can ride out market downturns without selling stocks
- Easier to stay the course
- Clear mental model for retirees

Potential Drawback:
- Cash drag on returns
- Cash earns less than invested
- May be mathematically similar to rebalancing
- Psychological benefit may not justify lower returns
- Requires active management to refill buckets

(2 points for explanation, 1 point for psychological benefit,
1 point for drawback)

### Section 6: Healthcare and Executive Retirement

**Answer 6.1 (5 points):**
```
Healthcare Options (Age 58 to 65):

Option 1: COBRA
- Duration: 18 months
- Cost: 102% of full premium
- Typical: $1,500-2,500/month individual, $2,500-4,000 family
- Pros: Same coverage, guaranteed
- Cons: Expensive, limited duration

Option 2: ACA Marketplace
- Duration: Until Medicare
- Cost: Varies by income and location
- If high income: $1,000-2,000/month
- If income managed <400% FPL: May get subsidies
- Pros: Guaranteed issue, possible subsidies
- Cons: Higher deductibles, limited networks

Option 3: Spouse's Employer Plan
- If spouse still working
- Usually most cost-effective if available

Option 4: Part-time Work with Benefits
- Some employers offer benefits at 20-30 hours
- Requires continued work

Estimated 7-Year Cost (58-65):
COBRA (18 mo) + Marketplace (5.5 yr)
$2,500 × 18 + $1,500 × 66 = $45,000 + $99,000 = $144,000

(2 points for options, 3 points for costs/analysis)
```

**Answer 6.2 (5 points):**
```
Considerations for Executive with $2M Unvested RSUs:

Understand the Stakes:
- $2M vesting over 18 months
- Retiring in 6 months = lose 12 months of vesting
- Rough estimate: Lose ~$800K-1.2M

Key Considerations:
1. What vests in next 6 months vs. after?
2. What happens to unvested RSUs at retirement?
   (Usually forfeited)
3. Are there any accelerated vesting provisions?
4. Is there a change in control clause?

Negotiate:
1. Acceleration of Unvested Equity
   - Request partial acceleration (e.g., 50%)
   - Frame as recognition of contributions

2. Extended Employment
   - Could 6 months extend to 12?
   - Part-time or consulting role?

3. Consulting Agreement
   - Continue vesting during consulting?
   - Check plan language

4. Retirement Classification
   - Some plans have favorable "retirement" treatment
   - May vest additional if retire vs. resign

Worth Noting:
One additional year may be worth $1M+
Calculate exact numbers before deciding

(2 points for considerations, 3 points for negotiation/strategy)
