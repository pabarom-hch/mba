# Retirement Distribution Strategies

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the 4% rule and its modern variations
- Design bucket strategies for retirement income
- Implement floor-and-upside approaches
- Optimize tax-efficient withdrawal sequencing
- Apply dynamic spending rules for portfolio longevity

---

## Introduction

Distribution strategy—how you withdraw from your portfolio in retirement—is as important as accumulation strategy. The wrong approach can deplete assets prematurely, while overly conservative withdrawals mean unnecessary lifestyle sacrifice. This topic covers various methodologies for sustainable retirement income.

---

## The 4% Rule

### Original Research

```
William Bengen (1994) Research:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Methodology:
- Tested various withdrawal rates
- 30-year retirement periods
- Historical returns (stocks/bonds)
- 50/50 to 75/25 allocations

Finding:
- 4% initial withdrawal, inflation-adjusted
- Survived all historical 30-year periods
- Even during worst markets (1929, 1966)

"SAFEMAX" = 4.15% (maximum safe rate historically)
```

### How the 4% Rule Works

```
Implementation:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Year 1: Withdraw 4% of portfolio
Year 2+: Withdraw same dollar amount, adjusted for inflation

Example:
Portfolio: $1,500,000
Year 1: $60,000 (4%)
Year 2: $61,800 (3% inflation adjustment)
Year 3: $63,654 (3% inflation adjustment)
...continue regardless of portfolio performance

Key Point:
Withdrawal based on INITIAL portfolio, not current
Adjusts for inflation, not market performance
```

### 4% Rule Criticisms and Limitations

```
Concerns:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Based on Historical Returns
   - Future may differ (lower expected returns)
   - Bond yields historically higher
   - 3-3.5% may be more appropriate today

2. Assumes 30-Year Retirement
   - Retire at 65, plan to 95
   - Early retirees need longer period
   - Lower rate for 40+ year retirements

3. No Flexibility
   - Withdraws same amount regardless of market
   - Doesn't reduce spending in downturns
   - May withdraw during worst times

4. Ignores Taxes
   - Pre-tax vs. after-tax accounts differ
   - Tax-efficient sequencing matters

5. Ignores Other Income
   - Social Security, pensions reduce portfolio need
   - Those with guaranteed income can spend more
```

### Modern Variations

```
Modified 4% Approaches:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Conservative (3.5%):
- For 35-40 year retirements
- Lower expected return environments
- Very risk-averse retirees

Dynamic (3-5% range):
- Start at 4%
- Reduce to 3% in bad years
- Increase to 5% in good years
- Adds flexibility

Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) Method:
- Divide portfolio by remaining life expectancy
- Naturally adjusts to market
- Ensures money lasts lifetime
- May under-spend early, over-spend late
```

## Bucket Strategy

### The Concept

```
Divide Portfolio into "Time Buckets":
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Bucket 1: Short-term (0-3 years)
- Cash, money market
- Covers near-term spending
- Protection against sequence risk

Bucket 2: Medium-term (3-10 years)
- Bonds, stable value
- Replenishes Bucket 1
- Moderate growth and stability

Bucket 3: Long-term (10+ years)
- Stocks, growth assets
- Not needed for years
- Can ride out volatility

         ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

         ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
         │  ┌─────────┐                        │

         │  └────▲────┘                        │
         │       │ Refill                      │
         │  ┌────┴────┐                        │
         │  │ Bucket 2│ Medium term (3-10 yr)  │
         │  │  Bonds  │                        │
         │  └────▲────┘                        │
         │       │ Refill                      │
         │  ┌────┴────┐                        │
         │  │ Bucket 3│ Long term (10+ yr)     │
         │  │ Stocks  │                        │
         │  └─────────┘                        │
         └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Bucket Implementation

```
Example: $1,500,000 Portfolio, $60,000 Annual Need

Bucket 1 (2 years):
Cash/Money Market: $120,000 (8%)

Bucket 2 (Years 3-8):
Bonds/Stable: $360,000 (24%)

Bucket 3 (Years 9+):
Stocks/Growth: $1,020,000 (68%)

Refilling Process:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Annual or when Bucket 1 depleted
- If stocks are up: Sell from Bucket 3 → Bucket 2 → Bucket 1
- If stocks are down: Sell from Bucket 2 → Bucket 1
- Avoid selling stocks in down markets
```

### Bucket Strategy Benefits

```
Psychological:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Know spending is covered for 2-3 years
- Less anxiety during market volatility
- Clear mental model
- Easier to stay the course

Practical:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Avoids selling stocks at lows
- Sequence of returns protection
- Maintains growth allocation
- Simple to understand and implement

Limitations:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Cash drag on returns
- May be mathematically similar to rebalancing
- Requires active management
```

## Floor-and-Upside Strategy

### The Concept

```
Divide Income into "Floor" and "Upside":
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Floor (Essential Expenses):
- Guaranteed income sources
- Social Security
- Pensions
- Annuities (if needed)
- Covers basic needs no matter what

Upside (Discretionary):
- Investment portfolio
- Variable income
- Covers wants and extras
- Can adjust to market conditions

Philosophy:
"Build a floor you can't fall through,
then take risk with the rest"
```

### Floor Construction

```
Example:
Essential expenses: $80,000/year

Floor Sources:
Social Security: $45,000
Pension: $25,000
Annuity purchase: $10,000 (from $150K premium)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Floor: $80,000 ✓

Remaining Portfolio: $1,000,000

Upside:
- Discretionary spending
- Travel, gifts, extras
- Legacy
- Can invest aggressively (needs are covered)
```

### Annuity Role in Floor Strategy

```
When Annuities Make Sense:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Insufficient guaranteed income for essentials
- High longevity risk (family history)
- Low risk tolerance
- No pension

Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA):
- Give insurance company lump sum
- Receive monthly income for life
- Essentially buying pension

Example (Age 65):
Premium: $200,000
Monthly income: ~$1,100 (depending on rates)
Annual: $13,200
"Payout rate": 6.6%
Includes return OF principal and interest
```

---

## Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Sequencing

### The General Rule

```
Traditional Order (Standard Guidance):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Taxable accounts first
   - Tax-efficient (only gains taxed)
   - Preserves tax-advantaged growth

2. Tax-deferred accounts second (Traditional IRA/401k)
   - Ordinary income when withdrawn
   - Subject to RMDs at 73

3. Tax-free accounts last (Roth)
   - Maximum time for tax-free growth
   - No RMDs
   - Can pass to heirs tax-free

But: This ignores bracket management!
```

### Bracket-Optimized Withdrawals

```
Better Approach: "Fill the Bracket"
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Each year, withdraw to fill low tax brackets

Example (MFJ, 2024):
10% bracket: $0 - $23,200
12% bracket: $23,200 - $94,300
22% bracket: $94,300 - $201,050

If Social Security + Other = $50,000 taxable

Room in 12% bracket: $94,300 - $50,000 = $44,300

Strategy:
- Withdraw $44,300 from Traditional IRA
- Fill 12% bracket (low tax rate)
- Additional needs from taxable or Roth
- Avoid jumping to 22%

Result: Pay less tax over retirement than
"standard" sequencing
```

### Coordinating Multiple Sources

```
Example: $100,000 Spending Need

Income Sources:
Social Security: $40,000 (85% taxable = $34,000)
Pension: $20,000

Taxable income already: $54,000
Room to 12% bracket top: $94,300 - $54,000 = $40,300

Need from portfolio: $100K - $60K = $40,000

Optimal Withdrawal:
Traditional IRA: $40,000 (fills 12% bracket)
Taxable: $0
Roth: $0

Could also do:
Traditional IRA: $30,000
Roth: $10,000 (tax-free income, some flexibility)
```

---

## Dynamic Spending Rules

### Guardrails Approach

```
Concept:
Set upper and lower guardrails around withdrawal rate

Example (Starting 5% rate):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Upper guardrail: 6%
Lower guardrail: 4%
Adjustment: 10% reduction or increase

Rules:
1. Each year, calculate current withdrawal rate
   (Annual spending / Portfolio value)

2. If rate exceeds 6%:
   Reduce spending by 10%
   "Portfolio struggling, cut back"

3. If rate falls below 4%:
   Increase spending by 10%
   "Portfolio thriving, spend more"

4. Otherwise, adjust for inflation as normal

Benefit: Extends portfolio life significantly
Drawback: Requires spending flexibility
```

### Floor + Ceiling Method

```
Alternative Dynamic Approach:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Set spending floor and ceiling

Example:
Initial spending: $60,000
Floor: $50,000 (never go below)
Ceiling: $75,000 (never go above)

Rules:
- Good years: Increase toward ceiling
- Bad years: Decrease toward floor
- Stay within bounds

Ensures minimum lifestyle while
allowing upside participation
```

### Comparison of Strategies

```
Strategy         Pros                    Cons
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4% Fixed         Simple, predictable     Inflexible
Buckets          Psychological comfort   Cash drag
Floor-Upside     Guaranteed essentials   May need annuity
Guardrails       Adapts to market        Variable income
RMD Method       Lasts lifetime          May under-spend
```

## Sequence of Returns Risk

### The Problem

```
Same average return, different outcomes:

Scenario A: Bad returns early
Year 1: -15%
Year 2: -10%
Year 3: +25%
Year 4: +20%
Average: 5%

Scenario B: Good returns early
Year 1: +20%
Year 2: +25%
Year 3: -10%
Year 4: -15%
Average: 5%

Accumulation: Both end up similar
Distribution: Scenario A devastates portfolio
              (Selling at lows depletes faster)
```

### Mitigating Sequence Risk

```
Strategies:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Cash Buffer (Buckets)
   - 2-3 years expenses in cash
   - Avoid selling equities in downturns

2. Flexible Spending
   - Reduce withdrawals in bad years
   - Guardrails approach

3. Conservative Early Years
   - Lower allocation first 5 years
   - Increase stocks after building cushion

4. Part-Time Work
   - Income reduces withdrawal need
   - Bridge difficult early years

5. Delay Social Security
   - Claims at 70 provide higher guaranteed income
   - Reduces portfolio pressure
```

## Worked Example

### Comprehensive Distribution Plan

**Client Profile:**

```
Robert and Susan Chen
Ages: 65 and 63
Retiring now
Annual spending need: $120,000
```

**Resources:**

```
Social Security (at FRA):
Robert (67): $32,000
Susan (67): $24,000

Portfolio:
Traditional IRA: $1,200,000
Roth IRA: $300,000
Taxable: $400,000
Total: $1,900,000
```

**Distribution Plan:**

```
Phase 1: Ages 65-67 (Bridge Years)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Social Security: $0 (delaying)
Need from portfolio: $120,000

Strategy: Tax bracket management
Taxable income capacity (22% bracket): ~$200,000

Withdraw:
Traditional IRA: $100,000 (fills lower brackets)
Taxable account: $20,000 (for additional needs)
Total: $120,000

Tax Impact:
$100K at blended ~15% effective = $15,000 federal
Roth conversion opportunity: Additional $80K at 22%

Phase 2: Ages 67+ (Social Security Active)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Social Security: $56,000 ($32K + $24K)
Need from portfolio: $64,000

Strategy: Optimize sources
SS taxable portion (~85%): $47,600
Other taxable income: ~$50K traditional
Total taxable: ~$97,600 (22% bracket)

Withdraw:
Traditional: $40,000-50,000
Taxable: $14,000-24,000
Roth: For extra needs or legacy

Sustainable Withdrawal Rate:
$64,000 / $1,900,000 = 3.4%
Very sustainable with SS covering base
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **4% is guideline, not rule** - Adjust for circumstances
2. **Flexibility extends portfolio** - Dynamic spending helps
3. **Sequence risk is real** - Early returns matter most
4. **Tax sequencing matters** - Fill brackets strategically
5. **Buckets provide comfort** - Psychological benefit
6. **Floor-upside works** - Guarantee essentials, risk the rest
7. **No one-size-fits-all** - Customize to client situation
8. **Monitor and adjust** - Plans need updating

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Safe Withdrawal Rate
$2M portfolio, expect 35-year retirement, no pension. What withdrawal rate seems appropriate? Calculate Year 1 withdrawal.

### Problem 2: Tax Sequencing
SS = $40K (85% taxable), pension = $20K, need $100K total. Have Traditional IRA, Roth, taxable accounts. Design tax-efficient withdrawal.

### Problem 3: Guardrails
Starting portfolio $1.5M, 4.5% initial rate ($67,500). After Year 1, portfolio = $1.2M. Calculate current rate and what adjustment guardrails suggest.
