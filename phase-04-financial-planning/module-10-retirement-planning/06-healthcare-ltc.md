Retirement:
- Reimburse past medical expenses anytime
- Or use for current healthcare
- At 65+: Can use for any purpose (just ordinary income, like Traditional IRA)

Tax-free money for healthcare in retirement!
```

```

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Once enrolled in Medicare:
- Cannot contribute to HSA
- Can still USE existing HSA funds

Planning:
- Max contributions before Medicare

- Stop HSA contributions 6 months before Medicare
  (Part A backdated 6 months if claimed after 65)

Coordination:

- Cannot pay Medigap premiums with HSA
- Can pay long-term care premiums (limited)
```

## Long-Term Care Planning

### Long-Term Care Need

```
Statistics:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
70% of people 65+ will need some LTC
40% will need nursing home care
Average nursing home stay: 2.5 years
Average home care duration: 3+ years

Costs (2024 National Averages):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Nursing home (private room): $9,733/month ($117K/year)
Nursing home (semi-private): $8,669/month ($104K/year)
Assisted living: $4,807/month ($58K/year)
Home health aide: $30/hour ($62K/year for 40hrs/week)

Costs vary dramatically by location
(2-3x higher in metro areas)
```

### Payment Options

```
Medicare:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Limited coverage
- Skilled nursing: Up to 100 days (following hospital)
- Home health: Skilled care only
- Does NOT cover custodial care (most LTC)

Medicaid:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Covers LTC for those who qualify
- Must be financially impoverished
- Spend down assets first
- Planning 5 years ahead (look-back period)
- Last resort, not first choice

Self-Insurance:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pay from savings
- Need substantial assets ($1M+ liquid)
- Risk of depleting legacy
- May be appropriate for wealthy

Long-Term Care Insurance:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Transfer risk to insurance company
- Premiums can be expensive
- Premiums may increase
- Use-it-or-lose-it concern
- Hybrid policies available
```

### Long-Term Care Insurance

```
Traditional LTC Insurance:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Benefits: Daily or monthly maximum
Benefit period: 2, 3, 5 years, or lifetime
Elimination period: Days before benefits begin (typically 90)
Inflation protection: Critical (compound vs. simple)

Premium Factors:
- Age at purchase (younger = cheaper)
- Health status
- Benefit amount and period
- Inflation protection type

Cost Example (Age 60, good health):
$150/day, 3-year benefit, 90-day elimination, 3% compound
Premium: ~$3,500/year couple

Hybrid LTC/Life Insurance:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Combines life insurance with LTC benefits
- If need LTC: Policy pays benefits
- If die without using: Death benefit to heirs
- "Use it or don't lose it"
- Single premium or limited pay
- No risk of premium increases
- Generally more expensive
```

### LTC Planning by Wealth Level

```
Wealth Level          Strategy
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
< $500K              - Medicaid planning
                     - Limited self-insurance
                     - May not afford LTC insurance

$500K - $2M          - Strong case for LTC insurance
                     - Partial coverage (3 years)
                     - Hybrid policy consideration

$2M - $5M            - Self-insure or insurance
                     - Hybrid policies attractive
                     - Consider asset protection

$5M+                 - Self-insure likely
                     - May buy for estate protection
                     - Medicaid not a concern
```

Client 67, MAGI $175,000 (single). Calculate monthly Medicare Part B and Part D costs including IRMAA.

### Problem 2: LTC Planning
