Category              Current    Retirement    Change
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Mortgage/Housing      $2,100     $2,100        Same (payoff optional)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL                $24,400    $15,300

Monthly need (gross): ~$15,000-16,000
Annual need: $180,000-192,000
(Higher than current spending due to healthcare/travel)
```

### Pre vs. Post Social Security

```
Phase 1: Early Retirement (Ages 55-67/70)
- No Social Security
- No Medicare (until 65)
- Full portfolio dependency
- Duration: 12-15 years (David) / 15-17 years (Jennifer)

Phase 2: Social Security Era (Ages 67/70+)
- SS benefits begin
- Medicare coverage
- Reduced portfolio need
- Duration: 20+ years

Key Challenge:
Portfolio must survive Phase 1 AND Phase 2
Phase 1 is more risky (no guaranteed income)
```

## Exhibit 4: Social Security Projections

### Benefit Estimates

```
David (FRA 67):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current estimate (full career): $3,400/month at FRA
If stops work at 55: Reduced benefit (fewer high years)
Estimated at FRA after early retirement: $3,100/month
At 70: $3,844/month

Jennifer (FRA 67):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current estimate (full career): $2,800/month at FRA
If stops work at 53: $2,500/month at FRA
At 70: $3,100/month

Combined at 70: $6,944/month = $83,328/year

Note: Early career stoppage reduces benefits
(Zeros in earnings history)
```

### Claiming Strategy Considerations

```
Option A: Both at 67 (FRA)
David: $3,100/month starting age 67
Jennifer: $2,500/month starting age 67
Combined: $5,600/month = $67,200/year

Option B: Both at 70
David: $3,844/month starting age 70
Jennifer: $3,100/month starting age 70
Combined: $6,944/month = $83,328/year

Difference: $16,128/year more with delayed claiming
But: Need portfolio to bridge 3 extra years
```

---

## Exhibit 5: Healthcare Bridge

### Pre-Medicare Options (Ages 53-65)

```
Jennifer (53-65 = 12 years):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Option 1: ACA Marketplace
Monthly: $1,200-1,800 (depending on income)
Annual: $14,400-21,600
12-Year Cost: $175,000-260,000

Option 2: COBRA (18 months only)
Monthly: $2,400 (estimate)
Then marketplace

David (55-65 = 10 years):
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Similar costs: $120,000-180,000

Combined Pre-Medicare Healthcare:
Conservative estimate: $400,000-450,000 over 10-12 years
Or: ~$35,000-40,000/year average
```

### ACA Subsidy Opportunity

```
ACA Premium Subsidy Eligibility:
Income below 400% Federal Poverty Level

2024 FPL for 2-person household: ~$20,440
400% = ~$81,760

Strategy:
If manage income (MAGI) below ~$82,000:
Could receive significant subsidies
Potential savings: $15,000-25,000/year

How to Manage Income:
- Withdraw from Roth (doesn't count as income)
- Sell taxable lots with low gains
- Control Traditional IRA withdrawals

Challenge:
$180K spending need vs. $82K income limit
Would need to use Roth extensively
May not be sustainable long-term
```

---

## Exhibit 6: Withdrawal Analysis

### Safe Withdrawal Rate Analysis

```
Portfolio at Retirement: $4,600,000
Annual Need: $180,000
Withdrawal Rate: $180,000 / $4,600,000 = 3.9%

30-Year Success Rate (Monte Carlo):
At 3.9%: ~85% historical success
At 4.0%: ~82% historical success
At 3.5%: ~92% historical success

But: 40-year retirement (55 to 95) requires lower rate
At 3.9% for 40 years: ~70% success
At 3.5% for 40 years: ~80% success

Initial Assessment:
Borderline feasible at current spending level
No margin for error
Healthcare costs could push over limit
```

### Withdrawal Sequence Strategy

```
Phase 1 (Ages 55-59½): Taxable + Roth Contributions
- Cannot access 401(k) without penalty
- Taxable accounts: $1,300,000
- Roth contributions (not earnings): ~$200,000
- Total accessible: $1,500,000
- Years covered: $1,500,000 / $180,000 = ~8 years
- Only need 4.5 years until 59½

Phase 2 (Ages 59½-67): Add Traditional
- Can access 401(k)/IRA
- Add Roth conversions
- Tax bracket management

Phase 3 (67+): Social Security Begins
- SS covers large portion
- Reduce portfolio withdrawals
- Potentially shift to Roth
```

## Analysis Questions

### Part A: Feasibility Assessment (25 points)

1. Calculate the true withdrawal rate needed considering taxes. If David and Jennifer need $180,000 after-tax, what must they withdraw from various accounts?

2. Run a sensitivity analysis: What happens if healthcare costs 20% more than projected? If investment returns are 1% lower?

3. Assess the impact of stopping work on Social Security benefits. What is the lifetime cost of retiring early vs. working until 62?

4. Evaluate whether the current spending estimate is realistic. What expenses might they be underestimating?

### Part B: Optimization Strategies (25 points)

1. Design a Social Security claiming strategy. Should they claim at FRA or delay? What's the break-even analysis given portfolio constraints?

2. Create a Roth conversion strategy for ages 55-67. How much should they convert annually to optimize lifetime taxes?

3. Develop a healthcare cost management strategy. How can they minimize costs while maintaining coverage?

4. Should they pay off the mortgage before retiring or keep the low-rate loan?

### Part C: Distribution Plan (25 points)

1. Create a detailed year-by-year withdrawal plan for ages 55-70 specifying:
   - Which accounts to tap each year
   - Tax bracket management
   - Roth conversion amounts

2. Design a bucket strategy for their portfolio showing:
   - Cash reserves (years 1-3)
   - Conservative investments (years 4-10)
   - Growth investments (years 11+)

3. What modifications should they make to their investment allocation at retirement?

### Part D: Risk Analysis and Contingencies (25 points)

1. What are the three biggest risks to this plan? For each, provide a mitigation strategy.

2. Develop contingency triggers. At what point should they consider:
   - Part-time work
   - Reducing spending
   - Relocating sooner

3. What "one more year" analysis would you present? Quantify the benefit of working one additional year.

4. How does sequence of returns risk affect this plan? What strategies can protect against it?

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Evaluate early retirement feasibility comprehensively
- Design multi-phase distribution strategies
- Navigate pre-Social Security and pre-Medicare gaps
- Apply tax optimization across retirement phases
- Build contingency planning into retirement plans

### Key Insights

**The Math is Tight:**
```
Need: $180,000/year
Portfolio: $4,600,000
Rate: 3.9%

Problems:
- 40-year retirement (too long for 4% rule)
- Healthcare adds $40K/year pre-Medicare
- No guaranteed income for 12-15 years
- SS benefits reduced by early retirement

Reality: Likely need $5M+ or reduce spending
```

**Healthcare is the Wild Card:**
```
Pre-Medicare costs (12 years):
Conservative: $400,000
If ACA subsidies: $200,000
If health issues: $600,000+

This uncertainty alone could derail the plan
Must have contingency for health surprises
```

**The "One More Year" Power:**
```
Working one additional year:
+ $185,000 savings
+ $180,000 not withdrawn
+ Investment growth: $280,000 (at 6%)
= ~$645,000 swing per year

Three years: $1.9M difference
This is why "one more year" is so tempting
```

### Model Solution Framework

**Recommendation: Conditional Go with Modifications**

```
Required Modifications:

1. Reduce spending target to $160,000
   Healthcare covered separately
   Withdrawal rate: 3.5%

2. Build $200K healthcare reserve
   Separate from retirement portfolio
   Covers 5 years of worst-case costs

3. Commit to part-time work as backup
   Define trigger: 20% portfolio decline
   Target: $30-50K/year if needed

4. Delay SS to 70 (both)
   Maximum survivor benefit
   Higher lifetime income
   Portfolio can support bridge

5. Aggressive Roth conversions
   Convert $50-80K/year ages 55-67
   Fill 22/24% brackets
   Reduces RMD pressure
```

**Withdrawal Plan (Ages 55-70):**

```
Ages 55-59 (David):
Source: Taxable accounts
Amount: $180,000/year
Tax impact: Primarily LTCG (15-20%)
Roth conversion: $50,000/year (fill 22% bracket)

Ages 60-65:
Source: Taxable + Traditional IRA
Amount: $180,000/year
Traditional: Start drawing to manage brackets
Roth conversion: Continue $60,000/year

Ages 65-67 (Medicare starts):
Healthcare costs drop significantly
Reduce need to $150,000/year
Roth conversion: $80,000/year (fill higher bracket)

Ages 67-70:
Social Security begins (Jennifer)
Need from portfolio: $120,000/year
Roth conversion: Reduce, SS fills bracket

Age 70+:
Both SS active: $83,000/year
Portfolio need: $97,000/year
Sustainable at 2.5% withdrawal
```

**Three Biggest Risks:**

```
1. Healthcare Cost Explosion
   Risk: Costs 50%+ higher than projected
   Mitigation: $200K separate reserve, relocate to
   lower-cost area, ACA income management

2. Sequence of Returns
   Risk: 30% drop in year 1-2
   Mitigation: 3-year cash bucket, flexible spending,
   guardrails approach, part-time work backup

3. Longevity Beyond 95
   Risk: Live 40+ years in retirement
   Mitigation: Delay SS, partial annuitization,
   home equity reverse mortgage as backup
```

### Discussion Questions

1. At what portfolio level would you feel confident recommending this early retirement? $5M? $6M?

2. Should they consider a phased retirement where one spouse works a few more years?

3. How does the desire to "live fully" in early retirement years conflict with sustainability?

4. What role should the home equity ($850K) play in the plan?

5. Is the FIRE movement's common assumption of 4% withdrawal rate appropriate for 40-year retirements?
