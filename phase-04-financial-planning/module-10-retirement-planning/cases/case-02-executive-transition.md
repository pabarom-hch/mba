## Analysis Questions

### Part A: Separation Negotiation (25 points)

1. Analyze the gap between the company's offer and Robert's desired terms. Which elements have the most negotiating leverage and which are likely non-starters?

2. What is Robert's BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)? How does "Rule of 65" retirement eligibility affect his position?

3. Develop a counter-proposal that balances Robert's priorities with realistic expectations. Quantify the value of each element.

4. What non-monetary terms should Robert prioritize (healthcare, transition support, non-compete scope)?

### Part B: Equity Optimization (25 points)

1. Analyze the unvested equity and create a strategy to maximize retention. What's the value difference between the offered and desired scenarios?

2. Develop a stock option exercise strategy. Consider:
   - Exercise window under various scenarios
   - Tax implications of NSO exercise
   - Diversification needs
   - Cash requirements

3. How should Robert handle his $4.2M in vested GlobalTech stock? Design a 3-year diversification plan.

4. Evaluate the deferred compensation distribution. Is the 10-year installment election optimal given Robert's situation?

### Part C: Distribution and Tax Planning (25 points)

1. Model Robert's income for the next 5 years including:
   - Severance
   - Deferred comp distributions
   - Stock sales
   - Board/consulting income
   Design a tax minimization strategy.

2. Create a Roth conversion analysis. Given the high income years ahead, are conversions beneficial?

3. Design a Social Security claiming strategy. Robert's PIA at 67 is $3,800, Maria's is $2,200.

4. How should the $2.8M taxable brokerage account be managed? Consider tax-loss harvesting, charitable giving, and long-term planning.

### Part D: Lifestyle and Transition (25 points)

1. Validate Robert's spending assumption of $400,000/year. Is it sustainable given his portfolio?

2. Address the emotional/psychological aspects of this transition. What resources or activities should Robert pursue?

3. Develop a contingency plan if board opportunities don't materialize as expected.

4. Create an integrated retirement plan showing projected net worth at ages 65, 70, 75, and 80 under base case assumptions.

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Navigate complex executive separation negotiations
- Optimize equity compensation at retirement
- Integrate tax planning with distribution strategies
- Address the unique challenges of executive retirement
- Balance financial optimization with emotional transition

### Key Insights

**Equity Value at Stake:**
```
                        Company    Negotiated   Difference
                        Offer      (Realistic)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RSU acceleration       $1,200K    $1,800K      $600K
PSU payout              $900K    $1,500K      $600K
Option window value     Limited    Extended     $200K+
Total Equity           $2,100K    $3,500K    $1,400K

Plus cash terms: Additional $500K-1M potentially

Total negotiation value: $2-3M
Worth investing time and potentially legal fees
```

**Concentration Risk:**
```
Company-related assets:
Vested stock: $4,200,000
Options (gross): $1,200,000
Unvested RSUs: $3,500,000 (if retained)
PSUs: $2,800,000 (if retained)
Deferred comp: $2,400,000
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Total GlobalTech: ~$14,100,000

% of Net Worth: 53%
% of Investable: 63%

This is SEVERE concentration
Post-separation diversification is critical
```

**Tax Complexity:**
```
Income Sources (Peak Year):
Severance: $1,900,000
Bonus: $475,000
Deferred comp: $240,000
RSU vesting (if retained): $1,200,000
Option exercise (if done): $1,200,000
Stock sales: Variable
Board income: $200,000+
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Potential taxable income: $5,000,000+

At California + Federal rates:
Marginal rate: ~50%
Tax planning critical
```

### Model Solution Framework

**Recommended Counter-Proposal:**

```
Separation Date: September 30, 2024 (9 months)
- Captures June 2024 RSU vest naturally
- Shows flexibility vs. December demand

Severance: 30 months base ($2,375,000)
- Split difference between 24 and 36

Bonus: Pro-rata through September (~$700,000)
- Reasonable compromise

RSUs: Accelerate Grant 2 in addition to natural Grant 1 vest
- Total: $2,200,000

PSUs: Pro-rata through September (~$1,400,000)
- Better than offer, less than full target

Options: 18-month extended exercise (vs. 90 days)
- Critical for tax planning

Healthcare: 24 months COBRA subsidy
- Covers gap to Medicare for Robert

Consulting: $10,000/month for 12 months
- Transition support, not full 24

Estimated Package Value: ~$9,000,000
(vs. $6,500,000 offered, $11,000,000 desired)
```

**Diversification Plan (Post-Separation):**

```
Year 1:
- Exercise 25,000 options ($400K spread, ~$200K tax)
- Sell sufficient stock to cover taxes + diversify $500K
- Roth conversion: $100K (may not be possible given income)
- Begin 10b5-1 plan for systematic selling

Year 2:
- Exercise 25,000 options
- Continue systematic stock sales ($800K)
- Board income replaces need for stock sales
- Roth conversion opportunity if income drops

Year 3:
- Exercise remaining 25,000 options
- Continue diversification ($600K)
- Target: <25% in GlobalTech by year 3

Year 5:
- Target: <15% in GlobalTech
- Fully diversified across asset classes
```

**Tax Strategy:**

```
High-Income Years (Years 1-3):
- Accept high tax rates (unavoidable)
- Bunch deductions where possible
- Charitable giving: Donate appreciated stock
- Installment timing: DC distributions smoothed

Lower-Income Years (After DC ends, before SS):
- Roth conversion opportunity
- Tax-loss harvest aggressively
- Manage capital gains timing

Social Security Strategy:
- Robert delay to 70: $4,712/month
- Maria claim at 67: $2,200/month
- Combined at Robert 70: $6,912/month = $82,944/year
- Survivor benefit protected
```

### Discussion Questions

1. How much of the negotiation should focus on monetary terms vs. non-monetary (healthcare, transition, non-compete)?

2. Should Robert "dig in" on the separation date or trade date for better equity terms?

3. How do you advise on the emotional aspects of this transition? What resources should you recommend?

4. At what net worth level does an executive like Robert no longer need to optimize every dollar, and how does that affect advice?

5. How should board conflicts of interest be managed if Robert joins a competitor board?

### Quantitative Exercises

1. Model the after-tax value of severance package under different scenarios.

2. Calculate option exercise timing to minimize AMT exposure.

3. Build a 20-year retirement projection with Monte Carlo analysis.

4. Compare lump sum vs. installment deferred comp under various tax scenarios.
