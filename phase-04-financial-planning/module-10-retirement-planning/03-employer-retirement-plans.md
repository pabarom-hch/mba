## Introduction

Employer retirement plans are a critical wealth-building tool, offering tax advantages, employer contributions, and forced savings discipline. For executives, these plans are supplemented by non-qualified deferred compensation and equity awards that require sophisticated planning. Understanding plan features, limits, and optimal strategies is essential for maximizing retirement security.

## Core Concepts

### Qualified vs. Non-Qualified Plans

```
Qualified Plans (ERISA):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Meet IRS requirements
- Tax-deductible contributions
- Tax-deferred growth
- Protected from creditors
- Subject to contribution limits
- Non-discriminatory

Examples: 401(k), 403(b), pension plans

Non-Qualified Plans:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Don't meet IRS requirements
- Tax-deferred (but not deductible to employer initially)
- No contribution limits
- Not creditor-protected (unsecured creditor)
- Can discriminate (executives only)
- 409A rules apply

Examples: Deferred compensation, SERP
```

---

## Defined Contribution Plans

### 401(k) Plans

```
Basics:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Employee contributes from salary (pre-tax or Roth)
- Employer may match or contribute
- Employee directs investments
- Vesting schedule for employer contributions
- Tax-deferred growth

2024 Contribution Limits:
Employee elective deferral: $23,000
Catch-up (age 50+): $7,500 additional
Total: $30,500 for 50+

Employer Match Types:
- Dollar-for-dollar match (up to X%)
- 50 cents per dollar (up to X%)
- Profit-sharing (discretionary)
- Safe harbor (mandatory)

Total Annual Limit (all sources): $69,000 (or $76,500 with catch-up)
```

### Maximizing 401(k) Benefits

```
Priority Order:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Contribute enough to get full employer match
   (Free money - 50-100% immediate return)

2. Max out contribution if possible
   ($23,000 + $7,500 catch-up)

3. Consider Roth vs. Traditional
   (Tax bracket now vs. retirement)

4. After-tax contributions (if mega backdoor allowed)
   (Convert to Roth for additional tax-free growth)

Investment Selection:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Use lowest-cost index options
- Avoid company stock (already exposed via employment)
- Match allocation to overall portfolio strategy
- Consider tax-efficient placement
```

### 403(b) and 457 Plans

```
403(b) Plans (Non-Profits, Schools, Hospitals):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Similar to 401(k)
- Same contribution limits ($23,000 + $7,500)
- May have additional 15-year rule ($3,000 extra)
- Often have annuity options (higher fees)
- May lack employer match

457(b) Plans (Government Employers):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Can be contributed to IN ADDITION to 401(k)/403(b)
- Same limits ($23,000 + catch-up)
- Catch-up rules different (3-year doubling before retirement)
- No 10% early withdrawal penalty
- Not aggregated with 401(k) limits

Strategy for Government Employees:
Max both 401(k)/403(b) AND 457(b)
Total possible: $46,000 + catch-up
Significant wealth accumulation potential
```

### Vesting Schedules

```
Cliff Vesting:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
0% vested until cliff, then 100%
Common: 3-year cliff

Year 1: 0%
Year 2: 0%
Year 3: 100%

Graded Vesting:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Increases over time

Year 1: 0%
Year 2: 20%
Year 3: 40%
Year 4: 60%
Year 5: 80%
Year 6: 100%

Or faster 3-year graded:
Year 1: 33%
Year 2: 66%
Year 3: 100%

Employee Contributions: Always 100% vested immediately
```

---

## Defined Benefit Plans

### Traditional Pension Plans

```
How They Work:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Employer bears investment risk
- Benefit formula determines payout
- Usually based on salary and years of service
- Provides lifetime income

Common Formulas:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Final Average Pay:
Benefit = Years × Multiplier × Final Avg Salary

Example:
30 years × 1.5% × $150,000 = $67,500/year

Career Average Pay:
Average of all years' salary (usually lower benefit)

Flat Dollar:
$50 per month × years of service
(Common in union plans)
```

### Pension Decision: Lump Sum vs. Annuity

```
Lump Sum Option:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pros:
- Control of assets
- Pass remainder to heirs
- Flexibility in spending
- Can potentially earn higher returns

Cons:
- Longevity risk on you
- Investment risk on you
- Requires discipline
- May spend too fast

Annuity Option:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pros:
- Guaranteed lifetime income
- No investment decisions
- Employer bears longevity risk
- Simple and predictable

Cons:
- No inheritance if single life
- Inflation erodes purchasing power
- Company bankruptcy risk (PBGC limits)
- Less flexibility
```

### Pension Analysis Framework

```
Evaluating Lump Sum vs. Annuity:

Step 1: Calculate Implicit Rate
What return does annuity imply?

Example:
Lump sum offered: $500,000
Annual annuity (single life): $35,000

Implied rate: $35,000 / $500,000 = 7%

If can earn > 7% with reasonable confidence, lump sum may win
If < 7% expected, annuity may be better deal

Step 2: Consider Survivor Needs
Single person: Single life annuity OK
Married: Joint and survivor usually essential

Step 3: Evaluate Credit Risk
Is company financially sound?
PBGC limits: ~$81,000/year max guarantee (2024)
If pension exceeds PBGC limit, consider lump sum

Step 4: Health and Longevity
Poor health: Lean toward lump sum
Excellent health: Lean toward annuity
```

## Executive Compensation

### Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (NQDC)

```
How It Works:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Executive elects to defer portion of salary/bonus
- No contribution limits
- Company credits "earnings" based on investment options
- Deferred until retirement or termination
- Taxed as ordinary income when distributed

Key Features:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Not an actual account (company's promise to pay)
- Subject to creditors if company fails
- Cannot change distribution election (409A)
- May have company match
- FICA taxes paid when vested, not when distributed
```

### 409A Rules

```
Section 409A Requirements:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Election Timing:
- Initial election: Before year services performed
- Existing plans: Before vested in benefits

Distribution Events (limited to):
- Separation from service
- Fixed date or schedule
- Change in control
- Disability
- Death
- Unforeseeable emergency

Changing Elections:
- Must be made 12+ months before original date
- New date must be 5+ years after original
- Limited to one change

Penalty for Violation:
- Immediate income inclusion
- 20% penalty tax
- Interest from deferral date
```

### NQDC Planning Considerations

```
Risk Assessment:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Company Risk:
- Is company financially stable?
- Already have salary + stock exposed to company
- Deferred comp adds MORE company risk
- Consider limiting deferrals if concerned

Career Risk:
- What if terminated before retirement?
- Distribution may occur at high-income year
- Check distribution rules upon separation

Tax Planning:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Deferral Value:
- Defer when income is high (high tax bracket)
- Distribute when income is lower (lower bracket)
- Retirement often lower bracket than working years

Distribution Election Strategy:
- Lump sum: Simpler, but income spike
- Installments: Spread income over years
- Fixed date: May not align with actual retirement
```

### Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (SERPs)

```
What They Are:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Employer-funded retirement benefit for executives
- Often restores benefits lost due to qualified plan limits
- May be defined benefit or defined contribution style
- Typically vesting over time
- Subject to 409A rules

Example:
Executive would receive $150,000/year from pension formula
But qualified plan capped benefit at $75,000
SERP "restores" additional $75,000

Risk:
Same as NQDC - unsecured promise from employer
```

---

## Company Stock in Retirement Plans

### ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan)

```
How It Works:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Company contributes stock to plan
- Employees accumulate shares over time
- Retirement or termination triggers distribution
- Often major part of wealth for ESOP companies

Risks:
- Extreme concentration in single stock
- Both job AND retirement tied to one company
- Enron-style disasters possible

Distribution Options:
- Cash distribution (company buys back shares)
- Stock distribution (NUA opportunity)
- Diversification required at age 55 (certain ESOPs)
```

### Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)

```
NUA Strategy:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
If company stock in 401(k)/ESOP with large gain:

Option A: Roll to IRA
- All distributions taxed as ordinary income
- Withdraw at marginal rate (up to 37%)

Option B: NUA Treatment
- Distribute stock to taxable account
- Pay ordinary income on cost basis only
- Future appreciation taxed as long-term capital gain
- Max LTCG rate: 20% + 3.8% NIIT = 23.8%

Example:
Company stock in 401(k): $500,000
Cost basis: $50,000
NUA: $450,000

Option A (Roll to IRA):
Future withdrawal: 37% × $500,000 = $185,000 tax

Option B (NUA):
Immediate tax on basis: 37% × $50,000 = $18,500
Tax on NUA (sell immediately): 23.8% × $450,000 = $107,100
Total tax: $125,600

Savings: $185,000 - $125,600 = $59,400
```

### When NUA Makes Sense

```
NUA is Beneficial When:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Large appreciation in company stock
- Low cost basis
- Will sell soon after distribution
- High ordinary income tax rate
- Lower capital gains rate applies

NUA May Not Be Worth It When:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Small appreciation
- Plan to hold stock long-term (step-up at death better)
- Low ordinary income rate anyway
- Want to defer taxes longer
```

---

## Plan Distributions

### Distribution Rules

```
Age 59½:
- Can withdraw without 10% penalty
- Still owe ordinary income tax

Age 55 Rule (401(k) only):
- Leave employer at 55+ and take distributions
- No 10% penalty
- Must be from that employer's plan

Age 73 (RMD start):
- Required Minimum Distributions begin
- Currently age 73 (increasing to 75 in 2033)
- Penalties for not taking RMD: 25% (was 50%)
```

### Rollover Options

```
Upon Leaving Employer:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Option 1: Leave in Old Plan
- If good investment options
- May have Rule of 55 access
- Must start RMDs at 73

Option 2: Roll to New Employer's Plan
- Consolidation
- May have better options
- Can still use Rule of 55 if applies

Option 3: Roll to Traditional IRA
- Maximum flexibility
- Unlimited investment options
- Lose Rule of 55 access
- May complicate backdoor Roth

Option 4: Roll to Roth IRA (Conversion)
- Pay taxes now
- Tax-free growth and withdrawals
- No RMDs
- Good if expect higher future taxes

Option 5: Cash Out (Generally Avoid)
- Immediate taxes
- 10% penalty if under 59½
- Lost tax-deferred growth
```

## Worked Example

### Executive Retirement Plan Optimization

**Profile:**

```
Name: Patricia Williams
Age: 58, planning retirement at 63
Position: SVP Sales, Fortune 500 company
Salary: $400,000
Bonus: $200,000 target

Retirement Plans:
- 401(k): $1,200,000
- NQDC: $600,000
- Pension: 30 years, 1.5% multiplier
- Company stock in 401(k): $200,000 (basis $30,000)
```

**Analysis:**

```
Step 1: Pension Calculation
30 years × 1.5% × $380,000 (final avg) = $171,000/year
Or lump sum option: $2,000,000

Implied rate: $171,000 / $2,000,000 = 8.55%
Analysis: Very good rate - lean toward annuity
But: Check survivor options for husband

Step 2: NQDC Distribution Planning
Current balance: $600,000
Elected distribution: 10-year installments at retirement

Tax analysis:
Working: 37% bracket
Retirement: Likely 32% bracket with pension + other income
Installments spread income - good strategy

Step 3: Company Stock NUA Opportunity
Stock value: $200,000
Cost basis: $30,000
NUA: $170,000

If roll to IRA and withdraw:
$200,000 × 37% = $74,000 tax

If NUA strategy:
Basis tax: $30,000 × 37% = $11,100
NUA tax (if sell): $170,000 × 23.8% = $40,460
Total: $51,560

Savings: $22,440 if use NUA

Step 4: Integration
Pension: $171,000/year (or lump sum analysis)
NQDC: $60,000/year for 10 years
401(k): $1,000,000 (after NUA shares removed)
NUA shares: $200,000 in taxable (after tax)

Total retirement resources: ~$3.8M equivalent
Plus Social Security starting at 67/70
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always get the match** - 401(k) match is free money
2. **Contribute maximum if able** - Tax-deferred compounding powerful
3. **Watch vesting schedules** - Time job changes carefully
4. **Deferred comp has company risk** - Don't over-concentrate
5. **Pension lump sum analysis** - Calculate implied rate
6. **NUA can save taxes** - On highly appreciated company stock
7. **Rollover decisions matter** - Consider all options
8. **Rule of 55 is valuable** - For early retirees leaving 401(k)

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Contribution Strategy
Employee age 52, income $180,000, employer matches 50% up to 6% of salary. 401(k) balance $400,000. What's optimal contribution strategy?

### Problem 2: Pension Decision
Lump sum: $800,000. Annuity: $52,000/year single life, $44,000 joint-50%. Age 65, spouse 63, both healthy. Analyze options.

### Problem 3: NUA Analysis
Company stock in 401(k): $350,000, basis $40,000. Employee age 60, 37% tax bracket. Calculate tax under NUA vs. IRA rollover scenarios.
