# Retirement Needs Analysis

## Learning Objectives

- Calculate retirement income needs using multiple methodologies
- Understand replacement ratio approaches and their limitations
- Build detailed expense-based retirement projections
- Apply Monte Carlo simulation to test retirement plans
- Account for inflation and longevity risk
- Adjust for lifestyle changes in retirement

---

## Introduction

The fundamental question in retirement planning is: "How much is enough?" This requires understanding both how much income you'll need and how long you'll need it. Retirement needs analysis combines quantitative projections with qualitative lifestyle planning, acknowledging significant uncertainty about health, longevity, inflation, and returns.

---

## Core Concepts

### Two Fundamental Questions

```
Question 1: How much will I spend in retirement?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Approaches:
- Replacement ratio (% of pre-retirement income)
- Detailed expense projection
- Lifestyle-based analysis

Question 2: How long will retirement last?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Considerations:
- Life expectancy tables (averages)
- Family history
- Health status
- Planning for longevity (outliving averages)

Key Insight: Plan for both unknowns
```

---

## Replacement Ratio Method

### The Concept

```
Definition:
Percentage of pre-retirement income needed in retirement

Traditional Rule of Thumb: 70-80%

Why Less Than 100%?
- No longer saving for retirement (15-20%)
- FICA taxes eliminated (7.65%)
- Work-related expenses gone (5-10%)
- Mortgage may be paid off (varies)

Why It Might Be More?
- Travel and leisure (especially early retirement)
- Healthcare costs (especially later retirement)
- Supporting adult children or parents
- No employer subsidies
```

### Replacement Ratio by Income Level

```
Income Level        Suggested Ratio    Reasoning
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
$50,000             85-90%            Basic expenses dominate
$100,000            75-85%            More discretionary
$200,000            70-80%            Higher savings rate
$500,000+           60-75%            Much higher savings rate
$1,000,000+         50-60%            Significant wealth effect

Higher earners need lower replacement ratio because
they save more of their income pre-retirement
```

### Replacement Ratio Example

```
Pre-Retirement Profile:
Gross income: $300,000
Current savings rate: 20%
FICA: 6.2% (capped) + 1.45% = ~$15K
Work expenses: $10,000/year
Mortgage: Paid off in retirement

Calculation:
Current spending = $300K - $60K (savings) - $15K (FICA)
                 = $225,000

Retirement needs:
$225,000 - $10,000 (work expenses) = $215,000

Replacement ratio: $215,000 / $300,000 = 72%
```

### Limitations of Replacement Ratio

```
Problems:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Assumes current spending is "right"
   - What if lifestyle inflated?
   - What if currently under-spending?

2. Ignores individual circumstances
   - Healthcare costs vary dramatically
   - Housing situations differ
   - Family obligations unique

3. Static assumption
   - Early retirement: Travel, activities
   - Middle: "Go-go" years slow down
   - Late: Healthcare dominates

4. Doesn't account for one-time expenses
   - Home repairs
   - Car replacement
   - Weddings, gifts

Better: Use as quick estimate, then build detailed budget
```

---

## Expense-Based Analysis

### Building a Retirement Budget

```
Step 1: Current Expenses (Baseline)
Track all spending for 12 months
Categorize into fixed, variable, discretionary

Step 2: Adjustments for Retirement
Remove work-related expenses
Add retirement-specific costs
Adjust for expected changes

Step 3: Apply Inflation
Use appropriate rates for each category
Healthcare inflates faster than general

Step 4: Create Phases
Early retirement: Active, travel
Middle retirement: Moderate activity
Late retirement: Healthcare focus
```

## Inflation and Longevity

### Inflation Assumptions

```
General Inflation: 2.5-3% long-term average

Category-Specific:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Healthcare: 5-6% (historically higher than CPI)
Housing: 3-4% (varies by location)
Food: 2-3%
Travel: 2-3%
Education (if applicable): 5-6%

Impact Over Time:
$100,000 today at 3% inflation:
10 years: $134,400 needed
20 years: $180,600 needed
30 years: $242,700 needed

Planning Error:
Underestimating inflation devastates long retirements
```

### Longevity Risk

```
Life Expectancy (US, current):
65-year-old male: 18 years (to age 83)
65-year-old female: 21 years (to age 86)

But averages are dangerous!
50% of people live LONGER than average

Probability of Reaching Age:
                        Male    Female    One of Couple
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Age 85                  35%      46%        64%
Age 90                  18%      29%        42%
Age 95                   6%      13%        18%

Couple (both 65): 50% chance one lives past 90

Planning Horizon:
- Individual: Plan to 90-95
- Couple: Plan to 95 or longer
- Don't plan to "average" life expectancy
```

### Longevity-Adjusted Planning

```
Example:
Retirement at 65
Need: $100,000/year
Inflation: 3%

Planning to Age 85 (20 years):
Total needed: ~$2.5M at 5% real return

Planning to Age 95 (30 years):
Total needed: ~$3.2M at 5% real return

Difference: $700K additional requirement

Better to plan long and have extra
than plan short and run out
```

## Retirement Phases

### The Spending Curve

```
Traditional Assumption: Flat spending (inflation-adjusted)

Reality: "Spending Smile"

         $
         │       Early
         │      ╱─────╲
         │     ╱       ╲
         │    ╱         ╲_______
         │   ╱                  ╲_______ Late
         │  ╱                          ╲
         └──────────────────────────────────→ Age
            65        75        85        95

Early (65-75): Active, travel, activities
Middle (75-85): Activity slows, spending decreases
Late (85+): Healthcare increases, other decreases
```

### The Three Phases

```
Phase 1: "Go-Go" Years (65-75)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Characteristics:
- High activity level
- Significant travel
- New hobbies, experiences
- "Bucket list" items
- May be highest spending period

Planning Implication:
- Build in extra spending for early years
- Front-load discretionary experiences
- Healthcare costs still moderate

Phase 2: "Slow-Go" Years (75-85)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Characteristics:
- Travel diminishes
- Activity level decreases
- More home-based
- Spending typically 10-20% lower
- Healthcare costs increasing

Planning Implication:
- Naturally lower spending
- Transition to less active lifestyle
- May reduce portfolio pressure

Phase 3: "No-Go" Years (85+)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Characteristics:
- Limited travel
- Healthcare dominates
- Potential long-term care
- Simplified lifestyle
- May have highest or lowest spending

Planning Implication:
- Healthcare and LTC costs critical
- Other spending reduced
- May need significant care funding
- Or may have minimal needs
```

## Monte Carlo Simulation

### The Concept

```
Problem: Single-point projections assume specific returns

Example of False Precision:
"You need $2.3M to retire at 65"

Reality:
- Returns vary year to year
- Sequence matters (especially early)
- Inflation unpredictable
- Lifespan uncertain

Monte Carlo Solution:
Run 1,000+ scenarios with randomized variables
Determine probability of success across scenarios
```

### How Monte Carlo Works

```
Step 1: Define Variables
- Starting portfolio
- Annual withdrawal (inflation-adjusted)
- Asset allocation
- Return distributions (mean, std dev)
- Inflation distribution
- Retirement length

Step 2: Run Simulations
For each of 1,000+ trials:
- Generate random return sequence
- Generate random inflation sequence
- Calculate year-by-year portfolio
- Track whether portfolio survives

Step 3: Analyze Results
- Success rate (% of trials where money lasted)
- Distribution of ending wealth
- Failure points (when failures occur)
```

### Interpreting Monte Carlo Results

```
Example Output:
$1.5M portfolio, $60,000 annual withdrawal
30-year retirement, 60/40 allocation

Success Rate: 82%

Percentile Analysis:
5th percentile ending wealth:   $0 (failed)
25th percentile:                $320,000
50th percentile (median):       $1,200,000
75th percentile:                $2,800,000
95th percentile:                $5,500,000

Interpretation:
- 82% chance of success (money lasting 30 years)
- 18% chance of running out
- If successful, likely to have significant wealth
- Wide range of outcomes possible

Is 82% Good Enough?
- Conservative view: Need 90-95%
- Flexible spending: 80% may be adequate
- Depends on risk tolerance and fallback options
```

### Monte Carlo Limitations

```
Caveats:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Assumes constant strategy
   - Real people adjust spending
   - Markets may prompt changes

2. Historical distributions
   - Future may differ from past
   - Particularly low-return scenario

3. Binary success/failure
   - Doesn't show magnitude of shortfall
   - Running out at 95 vs. 75 is different

4. False precision
   - 82% vs. 85% not meaningfully different
   - Wide uncertainty remains

Best Practice:
Use Monte Carlo for stress testing, not prediction
Focus on probability ranges, not specific numbers
Build flexibility into the plan
```

## Worked Example

### Comprehensive Retirement Needs Analysis

**Client Profile:**

```
David and Maria Gonzalez
Ages: 60 and 58
Planned retirement: David at 65, Maria at 63
Current income: $350,000 combined
Current savings rate: 20%
```

**Step 1: Replacement Ratio Quick Estimate**

```
Pre-retirement spending:
Income:                 $350,000
Savings (20%):          -$70,000
FICA taxes:             -$20,000
Available:              $260,000

Post-retirement needs (75% replacement):
$260,000 × 75% = $195,000

Quick estimate: ~$195,000/year
```

**Step 2: Detailed Expense Analysis**

```
Current Spending Analysis:

Category              Current    Retirement   Change
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Housing (mortgage)    $36,000    $0          Paid off
Property tax/ins      $15,000    $15,000     Same
Utilities             $6,000     $6,000      Same
Healthcare*           $12,000    $22,000     +$10,000
Food                  $18,000    $15,000     -$3,000
Transportation        $12,000    $8,000      Less commute
Travel                $20,000    $30,000     +$10,000
Entertainment         $8,000     $12,000     +$4,000
Clothing              $8,000     $4,000      -$4,000
Personal care         $4,000     $4,000      Same
Gifts/charity         $12,000    $15,000     +$3,000
Insurance             $6,000     $4,000      -$2,000
Miscellaneous         $10,000    $10,000     Same
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Subtotal             $167,000   $145,000    -$22,000
Taxes (estimate)      $45,000    $32,000    -$13,000
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL                $212,000   $177,000    -$35,000

*Healthcare: Pre-65 costs higher due to no Medicare
```

**Step 3: Inflation-Adjusted Projections**

```
Year 1 (both age 65/63): $177,000
Year 5: $177,000 × 1.03^5 = $205,000
Year 10: $177,000 × 1.03^10 = $238,000
Year 20: $177,000 × 1.03^20 = $320,000
Year 30: $177,000 × 1.03^30 = $430,000

Note: Healthcare inflating faster than general CPI
      Later years healthcare may dominate
```

**Step 4: Resource Inventory**

```
Income Sources:
Social Security (David at 70): $42,000/year
Social Security (Maria at 67): $28,000/year
Total guaranteed: $70,000/year (starting at David 70)

Assets at Retirement (projected):
401(k)/IRA: $2,800,000
Taxable: $600,000
Total investable: $3,400,000
```

**Step 5: Gap Analysis**

```
Phase 1 (Ages 65-70, before David's SS):
Needs: $177,000
Maria SS (starts age 67): $28,000 (year 3+)
Gap year 1-2: $177,000
Gap year 3-5: $149,000

Phase 2 (Ages 70+, both SS):
Needs: ~$200,000 (inflated)
Combined SS: $70,000
Gap: $130,000

Portfolio Required to Fill Gap:
$130,000 / 0.04 = $3,250,000

Assessment:
With $3.4M projected, basic needs met
Cushion is thin; little margin for error
Consider working additional year or reducing spending
```

3. **Plan for longevity** - Couples should plan to 95
4. **Account for inflation** - Especially healthcare
5. **Use Monte Carlo** - Test plans under various scenarios
6. **Expect spending to change** - The "retirement smile"
7. **Build in flexibility** - Plans will need adjustment
8. **Conservative assumptions protect** - Better to have extra

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Replacement Ratio
Pre-retirement income $450,000, saving 25%, FICA capped. Calculate replacement ratio if eliminating $15K work expenses and $24K mortgage payment.

### Problem 2: Monte Carlo Interpretation
Plan shows 78% success rate at $80K withdrawal. Client wants 90%+. What options exist to improve success rate?

### Problem 3: Phased Spending
Calculate 30-year spending need assuming: Base $150,000, years 1-10 add 10% for travel, years 21-30 healthcare increases to 15% of budget. Use 3% inflation.
