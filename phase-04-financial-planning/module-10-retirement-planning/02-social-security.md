## Introduction

Social Security provides the foundation of retirement income for most Americans, replacing approximately 40% of average pre-retirement earnings. For high earners, the replacement is lower, but benefits still provide significant guaranteed, inflation-adjusted income. Understanding benefit calculations and claiming strategies is essential for optimizing retirement income.

## Core Concepts

### Social Security Basics

```
What Social Security Provides:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Retirement Benefits:
- Monthly income starting at age 62 (or later)
- Adjusted annually for inflation (COLA)
- Guaranteed for life
- Based on 35 highest-earning years

Disability Benefits:
- Income if disabled before retirement age
- Medical coverage (Medicare after 24 months)

Survivor Benefits:
- Benefits for surviving spouse
- Benefits for dependent children
- One-time death benefit ($255)
```

### Eligibility Requirements

```
Work Credits:
- Earn credits through employment
- Maximum 4 credits per year
- 40 credits (10 years) for retirement benefits
- Fewer credits may qualify for disability/survivors

2024 Credit Amount:
$1,730 in covered wages = 1 credit
$6,920 earns maximum 4 credits for year
```

## Benefit Calculation

### Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)

```
Step 1: Calculate AIME (Average Indexed Monthly Earnings)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Take earnings from each year
- Index to current dollars (wage inflation)
- Select highest 35 years
- Calculate average monthly earnings

Step 2: Apply Benefit Formula (2024)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
90% of first $1,174 of AIME, plus
32% of AIME between $1,174 and $7,078, plus
15% of AIME above $7,078

Example:
AIME = $10,000

PIA = 90% × $1,174 = $1,057
    + 32% × ($7,078 - $1,174) = $1,889
    + 15% × ($10,000 - $7,078) = $438
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total PIA = $3,384/month

Step 3: Adjustment for Claiming Age
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Claiming before FRA: Reduced benefit
Claiming at FRA: Full PIA
Claiming after FRA: Increased benefit
```

### Full Retirement Age (FRA)

```
Birth Year          Full Retirement Age
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1943-1954          66
1955               66 and 2 months
1956               66 and 4 months
1957               66 and 6 months
1958               66 and 8 months
1959               66 and 10 months
1960 or later      67

Most current retirees: FRA = 67
```

### Age-Based Adjustment

```
Claiming Early (before FRA):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Reduction: 5/9% per month for first 36 months
          5/12% per month for additional months

Example (FRA 67, claiming at 62):
60 months early
First 36 months: 36 × 5/9% = 20%
Next 24 months: 24 × 5/12% = 10%
Total reduction: 30%

Benefit at 62: 70% of PIA

Claiming Late (after FRA, up to 70):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Delayed Retirement Credits: 8% per year (0.67%/month)

Example (FRA 67, claiming at 70):
36 months late: 36 × 0.67% = 24% increase

Benefit at 70: 124% of PIA
```

### Benefit by Claiming Age

```
Assuming PIA = $3,000 (at FRA 67):

Age     % of PIA    Monthly Benefit    Annual
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
62        70%        $2,100            $25,200
63        75%        $2,250            $27,000
64        80%        $2,400            $28,800
65        86.7%      $2,600            $31,200
66        93.3%      $2,800            $33,600
67 (FRA)  100%       $3,000            $36,000
68        108%       $3,240            $38,880
69        116%       $3,480            $41,760
70        124%       $3,720            $44,640

Difference: $2,100 vs. $3,720 = 77% more at 70 vs. 62
```

## Spousal Benefits

### Spousal Benefit Rules

```
Eligibility:
- Married at least 1 year, OR
- Divorced after at least 10 years of marriage
- Spouse must have filed for benefits (or suspended)

Spousal Benefit Amount:
- Maximum: 50% of spouse's PIA
- Reduced if claiming before FRA
- No delayed retirement credits (max at FRA)

Deeming Rules:
- If eligible for own benefit AND spousal
- Deemed to file for both
- Receive higher of the two
```

### Spousal Benefit Calculation

```
Example:
Primary earner PIA: $3,000
Lower-earning spouse PIA: $800

Option A: Own benefit at FRA: $800
Option B: Spousal benefit at FRA: $1,500 (50% × $3,000)

Result: Spouse receives $1,500 (higher of the two)

Technical Detail:
Actually receives own $800 + spousal top-up of $700
Total: $1,500

Early Claiming Impact:
If spouse claims at 62 (FRA 67):
- Own benefit: $800 × 70% = $560
- Spousal benefit: $1,500 × 65% = $975
- Receives $975 (reduced spousal is still higher)
```

### Divorced Spouse Benefits

```
Requirements:
- Married at least 10 years
- Divorced at least 2 years (if ex not collecting)
- Currently unmarried
- Age 62 or older

Benefits:
- Up to 50% of ex-spouse's PIA
- Does NOT reduce ex-spouse's benefit
- Can collect even if ex hasn't filed (if divorced 2+ yrs)
```

---

## Survivor Benefits

### Survivor Benefit Rules

```
Eligibility:
- Surviving spouse age 60+ (50 if disabled)
- Surviving divorced spouse (married 10+ years)
- Caring for child under 16 or disabled

Survivor Benefit Amount:
- 100% of deceased spouse's benefit
- Includes any delayed retirement credits
- Reduced if claimed early (different reduction table)

Key Point:
Survivor benefits are why higher earner should delay
Higher benefit becomes "insurance" for surviving spouse
```

### Survivor Strategy

```
Scenario:
Husband (higher earner) dies at 75
Wife is 72

Husband was receiving: $3,720 (claimed at 70)
Wife was receiving: $1,800 (own benefit at FRA)

After Death:
Wife receives higher of:
- Her own benefit: $1,800
- Survivor benefit: $3,720

Wife switches to survivor: $3,720

Household Income Impact:
Before death: $3,720 + $1,800 = $5,520
After death: $3,720
Reduction: 33% loss of household income

Planning Implication:
Higher earner delay creates larger survivor benefit
"Buys" longevity insurance for surviving spouse
```

---

## Claiming Strategies

### Individual Claiming Decision

```
Factors Favoring Early Claiming (62):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Poor health, reduced life expectancy
- Need income immediately
- Other assets can't bridge gap
- Very high portfolio withdrawal otherwise

Factors Favoring Delayed Claiming (70):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Good health, family longevity
- Portfolio can bridge the gap
- Desire maximum guaranteed income
- Spouse longevity protection
- Higher earner in couple
```

### Break-Even Analysis

```
Claiming at 62 vs. 70:
Monthly at 62: $2,100
Monthly at 70: $3,720
Difference: $1,620/month

Total received by age (assuming claim at 62):
Age 70: $2,100 × 96 months = $201,600
Age 75: $2,100 × 156 months = $327,600
Age 80: $2,100 × 216 months = $453,600

Total received if claim at 70:
Age 70: $0 (hasn't claimed yet)
Age 75: $3,720 × 60 months = $223,200
Age 80: $3,720 × 120 months = $446,400

Break-Even Point:
201,600 ÷ $1,620 = 124 months after age 62
62 + 10 years 4 months = Age 72 and 4 months

Actually closer to age 80 when accounting for:
- Time value of money
- COLA adjustments
- Taxes

Simple Rule: Live beyond ~80, delaying wins
```

### Couples Strategies

```
Strategy 1: Both Delay to 70
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Maximum total lifetime benefits if both live long
- Highest survivor benefit
- Requires bridging income for 8 years
- Best if both healthy, substantial assets

Strategy 2: Higher Earner Delays, Lower Claims Early
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Lower earner claims at 62-FRA for bridge income
- Higher earner delays to 70
- Protects survivor benefit
- Good balance of income and protection

Strategy 3: Both Claim Early
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Need income immediately
- Health concerns for both
- Lower lifetime benefits typically
- May be right if low life expectancy

Strategy 4: Optimized Based on Ages/Health
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Consider age difference
- Consider health of each spouse
- Model various scenarios
- Often Strategy 2 is optimal
```

### Example: Couples Strategy

```
John (67, higher earner): PIA $3,000
Mary (64, lower earner): PIA $1,200

Option A: Both at FRA
John at 67: $3,000
Mary at 67 (in 3 years): $1,200
Combined: $4,200/month

Option B: Mary early, John delays
Mary at 64: $1,200 × 80% = $960
John at 70: $3,000 × 1.24 = $3,720
Combined: $4,680/month

Survivor Comparison:
Option A survivor: $3,000
Option B survivor: $3,720 (24% more)

Bridge Period (John 67-70):
Mary's early benefit provides $960/month
Reduces portfolio withdrawals
John's delayed benefit rewards patience
```

## Taxation of Benefits

### How Benefits Are Taxed

```
Up to 85% of benefits may be taxable

Provisional Income Calculation:
AGI + Tax-exempt interest + 50% of SS benefits

Single Filer:
< $25,000: No tax on benefits
$25,000-$34,000: Up to 50% taxable
> $34,000: Up to 85% taxable

Married Filing Jointly:
< $32,000: No tax on benefits
$32,000-$44,000: Up to 50% taxable
> $44,000: Up to 85% taxable

High Earners: Almost always 85% taxable
Effective tax: 85% × marginal rate
At 24% bracket: 20.4% effective rate on SS
```

### Tax Planning Implications

```
Strategies:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Roth Conversions Before SS
   - Convert Traditional to Roth before claiming
   - Roth withdrawals don't count as provisional income
   - Reduces SS taxation in retirement

2. Municipal Bond Interest
   - Counts in provisional income (still)
   - But no federal tax on the interest
   - Mixed benefit

3. Timing of Other Income
   - Large capital gains spike provisional income
   - May want to spread realization

4. Delay SS While Working
   - Avoid taxation of SS while still earning
   - Also avoids earnings test
```

## Earnings Test

### Working While Collecting

```
Before Full Retirement Age:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2024 Limit: $22,320
Above limit: Lose $1 in benefits for every $2 earned

Year Reaching FRA:
2024 Limit: $59,520 (for months before FRA)
Above limit: Lose $1 for every $3 earned

After Full Retirement Age:
No limit - earn as much as you want

Important: Benefits aren't truly "lost"
They're deferred and recalculated at FRA
Eventually paid back through higher future benefits
```

### Earnings Test Example

```
Scenario:
- Age 63, claiming SS at $24,000/year
- Still working, earning $50,000
- Limit: $22,320

Excess Earnings: $50,000 - $22,320 = $27,680
Benefit Reduction: $27,680 ÷ 2 = $13,840

Original Benefit: $24,000
Reduced Benefit: $24,000 - $13,840 = $10,160

At FRA: Benefits recalculated as if claimed later
Not a permanent loss, but complex
Better: Don't claim if still earning significantly
```

## Integrating SS with Retirement Plan

### Role of Social Security

```
For Most Retirees:
SS = "Foundation" of retirement income
Build other income on top

For High Earners:
SS = Important component, but minority of needs
Still significant ($50K+ for couple at 70)

For Executives:
SS = Relatively small percentage of income
But guaranteed, inflation-adjusted
Use to enable more risk in portfolio
```

### Planning Framework

```
Step 1: Estimate Benefits
- Use SSA.gov my Social Security
- Estimate at 62, FRA, and 70

Step 2: Determine Claiming Strategy
- Consider both spouses
- Model various scenarios
- Factor in health, longevity, assets

Step 3: Bridge Planning
- If delaying, need income source
- Portfolio withdrawals
- Part-time work
- Other pensions

Step 4: Integrate with Distribution Strategy
- SS timing affects portfolio withdrawals
- Tax bracket management
- Roth conversion opportunities
```

4. **Break-even is ~age 80** - Earlier if healthy
5. **Benefits are taxable** - Up to 85% for high earners
6. **Earnings test isn't loss** - Benefits deferred
7. **Spousal strategy matters** - Coordinate claiming
8. **SS is inflation-adjusted guarantee** - Foundation of income

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Benefit Calculation
PIA of $2,800, FRA of 67. Calculate monthly benefit if claiming at: (a) 62, (b) 65, (c) 70.

### Problem 2: Spousal Benefit
Higher earner PIA: $3,200. Lower earner PIA: $600. Both at FRA. What does lower earner receive?

### Problem 3: Couples Strategy
Husband 66, healthy, PIA $3,500. Wife 63, PIA $1,500. Assets of $2M. Design optimal claiming strategy with rationale.
