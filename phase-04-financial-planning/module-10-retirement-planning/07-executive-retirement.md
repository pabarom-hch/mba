## Introduction

Executive retirement involves complexities beyond typical retirement planning: equity compensation with vesting schedules, substantial deferred compensation, golden parachute provisions, and often the possibility of board service or consulting. Optimizing the timing and structure of executive retirement can be worth millions of dollars.

## Retirement Timing

### Equity Vesting Considerations

```
Key Questions:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. What equity vests in the next 12-24 months?
2. What happens to unvested equity upon retirement?
3. Are there any cliff vesting events approaching?
4. How does retirement affect stock options exercise windows?

Typical Impact:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Upon Retirement:
- Unvested RSUs: Usually forfeited
- Stock options: Often 90-day exercise window
- Performance shares: Pro-rata based on time
- Long-term incentive: May vest or forfeit
```

### Retirement Timing Analysis

```
Example: Executive Considering Retirement

Current Date: January 2024
Proposed Retirement: June 2024

Equity Position:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
100,000 RSUs vesting March 2024: $2,500,000
50,000 RSUs vesting March 2025: $1,250,000 (forfeited)
Performance shares (3-year): $800,000 (pro-rata ~$400,000)
Stock options expiring 2029: Reduced window (90 days)

Retire June 2024:
Keep: $2,500,000 + $400,000 = $2,900,000
Lose: $1,250,000

Retire March 2025:
Keep: $2,500,000 + $1,250,000 + $600,000 = $4,350,000

Value of Waiting 9 Months: $1,450,000

Consideration: Health, other factors may override
But: Know the cost of early departure
```

### Negotiating Retirement Package

```
Potentially Negotiable Elements:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Acceleration of Unvested Equity
   - Partial or full vesting
   - Especially if "good leaver"

2. Extended Option Exercise Period
   - Beyond standard 90 days
   - May request 1-2 years

3. Continued Healthcare Coverage
   - Extended COBRA subsidy
   - Retiree medical benefit

4. Consulting Agreement
   - Continued income
   - Maintains some benefits
   - Allows gradual transition

5. Severance or Retirement Bonus
   - One-time payment
   - May be in addition to normal benefits
```

## Deferred Compensation Planning

### Distribution Election Strategies

```
Key Timing Decisions:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When Were Elections Made?
- 409A requires election before year earned
- Cannot change once in the year

Distribution Triggers:
- Separation from service
- Specific date (fixed schedule)
- Change in control
- Disability or death

Common Structures:
- Lump sum at retirement
- 5 or 10-year installments
- Fixed date regardless of retirement
```

### Tax Optimization

```
Problem: Large lump sum = high tax bracket

Example:
Deferred compensation balance: $2,000,000
Other retirement income: $200,000/year

Lump Sum Scenario:
Year 1: $2,000,000 + $200,000 = $2,200,000
Tax: ~$700,000+ (37% bracket)

10-Year Installment Scenario:
Each year: $200,000 + $200,000 = $400,000
Tax: ~$80,000/year
Total over 10 years: $800,000

Slight Disadvantage in Total Tax:
But: Preserves capital, lower annual burden
     Avoid bunching into highest bracket
```

### Coordination with Other Income

```
Strategic Considerations:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Social Security Timing
   - If large deferred comp, may delay SS
   - Avoid stacking income sources

2. Roth Conversions
   - May be difficult with large annual distributions
   - Or may convert in years before distributions start

3. Medicare IRMAA
   - High income = higher Medicare premiums
   - Plan for 2-year lookback

4. State Taxation
   - Some states don't tax retirement income
   - Moving before distributions may save taxes
   - But: Source state may still tax
```

## Healthcare Bridge to Medicare

### Pre-Medicare Options

```
Option 1: COBRA
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Duration: Up to 18 months (36 for some events)
Cost: 102% of full premium (employer + employee portions)
Example: $2,000-3,000/month for family

Pros:
- Same coverage as employed
- Guaranteed acceptance
- No medical underwriting

Cons:
- Very expensive
- Limited duration
- May not reach Medicare

Option 2: ACA Marketplace
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cost: Varies by income and location
Subsidies: Available if income below 400% FPL
           (~$62,000 single, ~$125,000 family)

Pros:
- Subsidies for lower income
- Guaranteed issue
- Can continue until Medicare

Cons:
- High income = no subsidies
- Limited plan choices some areas
- Higher deductibles common
```

### Healthcare Bridge Strategy

```
Example: Executive Retiring at 60

Annual Healthcare Need: 5 years (to Medicare at 65)

Strategy A: COBRA + Marketplace
Years 1-1.5: COBRA ($2,500/month = $45,000)
Years 2-5: Marketplace ($1,500/month = $54,000)
Total: ~$99,000

Strategy B: Manage Income for ACA Subsidies
Keep income below 400% FPL
May require:
- Roth conversions early (before retirement)
- Careful distribution sequencing
- Possible savings: $30,000-50,000

Strategy C: Negotiate Retiree Coverage
Some employers offer:
- Subsidized retiree medical
- COBRA subsidy as part of package
- Bridge coverage to Medicare
```

## Concentrated Stock Transition

### The Retirement Trigger

```
Retirement Creates:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Options must be exercised (usually 90 days)
- RSUs that vest at retirement become stock
- 10b5-1 plans may terminate
- Trading restrictions may ease (depending on role)

Opportunity:
- No longer insider (eventually)
- No blackout periods (eventually)
- Easier to diversify

Challenge:
- Large amount to diversify quickly
- May still have material information briefly
- Tax implications of exercise/sale
```

### Post-Retirement Diversification

```
Strategy for Stock Options:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
90-Day Window Challenge:
- Must exercise or lose vested options
- Creates large tax event
- Creates concentrated position

Approach:
1. Exercise all in-the-money options
2. Sell sufficient shares for taxes
3. Hold remainder briefly or diversify immediately
4. May stagger sales over next years

Tax Example:
100,000 options, strike $20, current $70
Spread: $5,000,000
Tax (~50% with state): $2,500,000
Net after exercise: $7,000,000 - $2,500,000 = $4,500,000

Strategy for RSU Stock:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Already taxed at vesting
Can sell immediately with minimal tax
(Only gains since vesting date)
Diversify as quickly as comfortable
```

### Post-Insider Transition

```
Cooling-Off Period:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After retirement, may still be considered insider if:
- Possess material non-public information
- On board of directors
- Consulting with access to inside info

Best Practice:
- Wait for next earnings release
- Ensure no MNPI
- Consult with former company's legal
- Then diversify freely

Rule 144 Considerations:
- If "affiliate" during past 90 days
- Volume limitations on sales
- Filing requirements
- May need to wait for clean status
```

---

## Post-Retirement Income

### Board Service

```
Typical Director Compensation:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Annual retainer: $50,000 - $300,000
Committee chair: Additional $10,000 - $30,000
Equity grants: $100,000 - $250,000/year
Meeting fees: May or may not be additional

Time Commitment:
- 4-8 board meetings per year
- Committee meetings
- Preparation time: 100-200 hours/year

Considerations:
- Fiduciary responsibility
- Potential liability (D&O insurance critical)
- Insider trading restrictions
- May affect ability to trade former company stock
```

### Consulting Arrangements

```
Types of Consulting:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Structured Consulting with Former Employer
   - Transition support
   - Typically 6-12 months
   - May include non-compete
   - Often part of separation agreement

2. Independent Consulting
   - Advisory roles for other companies
   - Expert witness
   - Private equity advisor
   - Interim executive roles

3. Advisory Board (not fiduciary board)
   - Less responsibility than director
   - Often equity-based
   - Start-up or private company

Tax Considerations:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Self-employment tax (15.3% up to wage base)
- Need to make quarterly estimated payments
- Can deduct business expenses
- May affect deferred comp timing
```

### Structuring Consulting Agreement

```
Key Terms to Negotiate:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Compensation:
- Hourly rate vs. retainer
- Typical exec consulting: $300-1,000/hour
- Retainer: $5,000-25,000/month

Scope:
- Specific deliverables
- Time commitment (hours/month)
- Exclusivity requirements

Duration:
- Fixed term vs. ongoing
- Termination provisions
- Renewal options

Benefits:
- Some may include healthcare
- May preserve certain perks
- Travel reimbursement

Restrictions:
- Non-compete scope
- Non-solicitation
- Confidentiality
```

## Loss of Perks and Lifestyle

### Hidden Costs of Retirement

```
Benefits Lost Upon Retirement:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Item                        Estimated Value
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Executive health coverage   $20,000-40,000/year
Life insurance             $5,000-20,000/year
Disability insurance       Varies
Company car or allowance   $10,000-20,000/year
Executive physical         $2,000-5,000/year
Club memberships           $5,000-20,000/year
Event tickets              $5,000-15,000/year
Travel perks (first class) $10,000-30,000/year
Support staff              $50,000-150,000/year
Office space               Varies
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Potential Total:           $100,000-300,000+/year

Planning Note:
Budget for replacing valued perks
Or accept lifestyle changes
Many executives underestimate this impact
```

### Psychological Transition

```
Beyond Financial:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Identity:
- "I am a CEO" → "I was a CEO"
- Loss of title and status
- Need new purpose

Structure:
- Calendar managed by others → Self-directed
- Meetings and decisions → Open time
- Can feel disorienting

Relationships:
- Work colleagues less accessible
- Need to build non-work connections
- May feel isolated

Planning Recommendation:
- Establish post-retirement activities BEFORE leaving
- Board seats, consulting, hobbies
- Phase out gradually if possible
- Many executives struggle without plan
```

## Worked Example

### Executive Retirement Package Analysis

**Profile:**

```
Name: Margaret Chen, CEO
Age: 62
Company: MedTech Inc.
Compensation:
- Base: $800,000
- Bonus (target): $1,200,000
- Equity: $2,000,000/year
Proposed retirement: December 2024
```

**Equity Analysis:**

```
Position                   Value        Status
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Vested stock:             $5,000,000   Owned
Unvested RSUs (vest 2025):$1,500,000   Forfeit if retire now
Performance shares:        $2,000,000   Pro-rata (~$800K)
Stock options (in $):     $3,000,000   90-day window
Deferred comp:            $4,000,000   10-year installments
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Retire December 2024:
Keep: $5M + $800K + $3M + $4M = $12.8M
Forfeit: $1.5M (unvested RSUs) + $1.2M (performance)

Retire December 2025 (1 more year):
Keep: $5M + $1.5M + $1.3M + $3M + $4.5M = $15.3M

Value of Additional Year: ~$2.5M
```

**Recommendation:**

```
Option A: Retire December 2024
If health or personal reasons require
Negotiate:
- Acceleration of 2025 RSUs (ask for 50% = $750K)
- Extended option exercise (12 months vs. 90 days)
- 18-month consulting ($20K/month = $360K)
- COBRA subsidy (save $30K)
Potential recovery: $1.14M of $2.5M gap

Option B: Retire December 2025
Capture full vesting
Additional compensation: ~$3M (salary + bonus)
Better position overall

Final Consideration:
Is $2.5M worth one more year?
Personal/health factors may override
But enter negotiation knowing the numbers
```
