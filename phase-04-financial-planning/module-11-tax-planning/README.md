## Core Concepts

### Marginal vs. Effective Tax Rate

Understanding the difference is critical for planning:

```
2024 Federal Tax Brackets (Married Filing Jointly):

Taxable Income          Rate    Tax on Bracket
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
$0 - $23,200           10%     $2,320
$23,201 - $94,300      12%     $8,532
$94,301 - $201,050     22%     $23,485
$201,051 - $383,900    24%     $43,884
$383,901 - $487,450    32%     $33,112
$487,451 - $731,200    35%     $85,312
Over $731,200          37%     Unlimited

Example: Taxable income = $500,000
Marginal rate: 35%
Total tax: $2,320 + $8,532 + $23,485 + $43,884 + $33,112 + $4,392 = $115,725
Effective rate: $115,725 / $500,000 = 23.1%
```

### Tax Alpha

Tax alpha represents the value added through tax-efficient strategies:

```
Tax Alpha Sources:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Asset Location
   Pre-tax accounts: High-yield bonds, REITs
   Tax-free accounts: High-growth stocks
   Taxable accounts: Tax-efficient index funds, munis

2. Tax-Loss Harvesting
   Realize losses to offset gains
   Maintain market exposure via similar assets
   Potential value: 0.5-1.0% annually

3. Charitable Planning
   Donate appreciated securities
   Donor-advised funds for bunching
   Qualified charitable distributions

4. Withdrawal Sequencing
   Optimize which accounts to tap when
   Manage bracket throughout retirement
```

## Critical Tax Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Planning Implication |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| AGI | Gross income minus adjustments | Gateway to many deductions/credits |
| MAGI | AGI with certain items added back | Determines IRA, ACA, IRMAA eligibility |
| AMT | Alternative Minimum Tax | Affects stock option timing |
| NIIT | 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax | Applies above $250K MFJ MAGI |
| Basis | Cost for gain/loss calculation | Track carefully for tax efficiency |
| Wash Sale | Disallowed loss if repurchase within 30 days | Impacts tax-loss harvesting |

---

## Quantitative Tools

### Tax Equivalent Yield

For comparing municipal bonds to taxable bonds:

```
Tax-Equivalent Yield = Municipal Yield / (1 - Marginal Tax Rate)

Example:
Municipal bond yield: 4%
Marginal tax rate: 37% federal + 10% state = 47%

Tax-equivalent yield = 4% / (1 - 0.47) = 7.55%

Decision: Compare 7.55% to available taxable yields
```

### After-Tax Return

```
After-Tax Return = Pre-Tax Return × (1 - Tax Rate on Gains)

Example:
Investment return: 10%
Held 1 year: 10% × (1 - 0.37) = 6.3% after-tax
Held 2 years: 10% × (1 - 0.20) = 8.0% after-tax

Difference: 1.7% annually from holding period
```

After-Tax Proceeds = Selling Price - Basis - (Gain × Tax Rate)
Tax-Equivalent Yield = Tax-Free Yield / (1 - Marginal Rate)
