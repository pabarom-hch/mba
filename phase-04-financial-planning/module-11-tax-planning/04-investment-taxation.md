## Introduction

Investment income receives varied tax treatment depending on its source and character. Understanding these differences enables advisors to recommend appropriate asset location, select tax-efficient investments, and project after-tax returns accurately. This chapter covers dividends, interest, passive income, and the complexities of flow-through entity taxation.

## Dividend Taxation

### Ordinary vs. Qualified Dividends

```
ORDINARY DIVIDENDS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tax rate: Ordinary income rates (10-37%)
Sources:
- REITs (most distributions)
- Money market funds
- Some foreign dividends
- Dividends from tax-exempt organizations
- Short-term holding period dividends

QUALIFIED DIVIDENDS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tax rate: Preferential rates (0%, 15%, 20%)
Requirements:
1. From U.S. corporation or qualified foreign corporation
2. Holding period met (61-day rule)
3. Not from disqualified sources

Holding Period Rule:
Must hold stock 61+ days during 121-day window
centered on ex-dividend date
(61 days before through 60 days after)

2024 Qualified Dividend Rates:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    0%           15%          20%
Single             ≤$47,025     $47,026-     >$518,900
                                $518,900
MFJ                ≤$94,050     $94,051-     >$583,750
                                $583,750
```

### REIT Distributions

```
REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST TAXATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
REITs must distribute 90%+ of taxable income
Therefore: Most income is ordinary (not qualified)

REIT Dividend Components:
1. Ordinary dividends: Most common, taxed as ordinary
2. Qualified dividends: Rare, if from REIT's stock holdings
3. Capital gains: Pass through at LTCG rates
4. Return of capital: Reduces basis, not currently taxed

199A Deduction for REIT Income:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Qualified REIT dividends eligible for 20% deduction
Effectively reduces top rate from 37% to ~29.6%

Example:
REIT ordinary dividend: $10,000
Section 199A deduction (20%): $2,000
Taxable: $8,000
At 37% rate: $2,960
Effective rate: 29.6%

WHERE TO HOLD REITs:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ideal: Tax-deferred accounts (401k, IRA)
Why: Avoid ordinary income rates
     Don't lose qualified dividend benefit
     199A deduction lost in retirement accounts anyway

If must hold in taxable: Still get 199A deduction
                         Better than bonds
                         Consider total return
```

## Interest Income Taxation

### Types of Interest

```
TAXABLE INTEREST (Ordinary Income):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sources:
- Bank accounts, CDs
- Corporate bonds
- Treasury securities (federal only)
- Mortgage-backed securities
- Most bond funds

Rate: Ordinary income (10-37%)
Form: 1099-INT or 1099-OID

TAX-EXEMPT INTEREST:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sources:
- Municipal bonds (federal exempt)
- In-state municipal bonds (often state exempt too)
- Some municipal bond funds

Rate: $0 federal tax
      May be state exempt if in-state

Reporting: Form 1099-INT Box 8
           Still reported, but not taxed

AMT Consideration:
Private activity municipal bonds
May be taxable for AMT purposes
```

### Tax-Equivalent Yield

```
FORMULA:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tax-Equivalent Yield = Muni Yield / (1 - Marginal Rate)

Example 1: Federal Only
Muni bond yield: 4.0%
Federal rate: 37%

TEY = 4.0% / (1 - 0.37) = 6.35%

A 6.35% taxable bond would provide same after-tax return

Example 2: Federal + State
Muni bond yield: 4.0%
Federal rate: 37%
State rate: 10%
In-state bond: Yes

Combined rate: 37% + 10% × (1 - 0.37) = 43.3%
TEY = 4.0% / (1 - 0.433) = 7.05%

Example 3: NIIT Consideration
Add NIIT if applicable: 3.8%
Combined rate: 37% + 3.8% + 10% × (1 - 0.408) = 46.7%
TEY = 4.0% / (1 - 0.467) = 7.50%

WHEN MUNIS MAKE SENSE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Higher marginal rate: More valuable
In-state bonds: Additional state benefit
High-tax state: More valuable
NIIT applies: More valuable

Compare TEY to available taxable yields
Include credit risk differential
```

### Original Issue Discount (OID)

```
WHAT IS OID:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Bond issued below par value
Difference accrues over life as interest
Taxed annually even if not received (phantom income)

Example:
Zero-coupon bond: $500 purchase, $1,000 at maturity (20 years)
OID: $500
Annual accrual: ~$25/year (approximation)
Each year: Report ~$25 interest income
At maturity: No additional gain (basis built up)

TREASURY STRIPS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Zero-coupon Treasury securities
OID accrues annually
Federal tax (no state tax)
Better in tax-deferred accounts

BEST PRACTICE:
Hold OID bonds in tax-deferred accounts
Avoid phantom income taxation
```

## Passive Activity Rules

### Active vs. Passive Income

```
THREE INCOME CATEGORIES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. ACTIVE (Earned) Income:
   - Wages, salaries
   - Self-employment income
   - Active business income

2. PORTFOLIO Income:
   - Interest, dividends
   - Capital gains
   - Royalties (generally)

3. PASSIVE Income:
   - Rental activities (generally)
   - Limited partnership interests
   - Business without material participation

KEY RULE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Passive LOSSES can only offset passive INCOME
Cannot offset active or portfolio income
Unused losses carry forward
Released upon disposition of activity
```

### Material Participation Tests

```
TO ESCAPE PASSIVE CLASSIFICATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Must "materially participate" in the activity
Meet ONE of seven tests:

1. 500-Hour Test
   Participate 500+ hours during year

2. Substantially All Test
   Your participation is substantially all participation

3. 100-Hour/Not Less Test
   100+ hours AND not less than any other person

4. Significant Participation Activity (SPA)
   100+ hours in multiple SPAs
   Combined SPAs total 500+ hours

5. Prior Year Material Participation
   Materially participated in any 5 of prior 10 years

6. Personal Service Activity
   3 prior years of material participation

7. Facts and Circumstances
   100+ hours AND based on facts, materially participated

REAL ESTATE EXCEPTION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Real estate professionals can treat rental as active if:
- 750+ hours in real property trades/businesses
- More than 50% of personal services in real estate
- Material participation in each rental
```

### Passive Loss Planning

```
SUSPENDED LOSSES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Losses exceeding passive income = suspended
Carry forward indefinitely
Released when:
- Generate passive income
- Dispose of entire interest in activity (fully taxable)

Example:
Year 1: Rental loss $20,000, no passive income
        Suspended: $20,000
Year 2: Rental loss $15,000, no passive income
        Suspended: $35,000
Year 3: Rental profit $10,000
        Use $10,000 suspended loss
        Remaining suspended: $25,000
Year 4: Sell rental property
        Remaining $25,000 loss released
        Offsets sale gain (if any) or other income

STRATEGIES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Generate passive income
   - Invest in income-producing partnerships
   - Passive business income

2. Qualify as real estate professional
   - If significant real estate activities
   - Converts to non-passive

3. Dispose of activity
   - Fully taxable sale
   - Releases suspended losses

4. $25,000 Active Participation Exception
   - For rental real estate
   - If AGI < $100,000
   - Phase out $100K-$150K
   - Up to $25K loss against active income
```

## K-1 Reporting

### Partnership and S-Corporation Income

```
FLOW-THROUGH TAXATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Partnerships and S-Corps don't pay entity-level tax
Income/loss flows to owners via Schedule K-1
Owners report on personal returns

K-1 BOX CONTENTS (Partnership):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Box 1: Ordinary business income (loss)
Box 2: Net rental real estate income (loss)
Box 3: Other net rental income (loss)
Box 4a: Guaranteed payments
Box 5: Interest income
Box 6a: Ordinary dividends
Box 6b: Qualified dividends
Box 7: Royalties
Box 8: Net short-term capital gain (loss)
Box 9a: Net long-term capital gain (loss)
Box 11: Other income (loss)
Box 13: Credits
Box 19: Distributions

CHARACTER PRESERVATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Income retains character when flowing through
LTCG at partnership → LTCG to partner
Qualified dividends → Qualified to partner
Tax-exempt income → Tax-exempt to partner
```

### K-1 Complexities

```
TIMING ISSUES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
K-1s often issued after individual tax deadline
Partnerships have until March 15 (calendar year)
May require extensions for personal returns

SELF-EMPLOYMENT TAX:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
General partners: Subject to SE tax on distributive share
Limited partners: Generally exempt
S-Corp shareholders: Subject on wages only
                     (reasonable compensation issue)

QUALIFIED BUSINESS INCOME (199A):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pass-through income may qualify for 20% deduction
Limitations:
- W-2 wage limit for high-income
- Specified service trades phase-out
- Taxable income thresholds

STATE TAX COMPLICATIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
May owe tax in state where partnership operates
Multi-state partnerships: Multiple state returns
Withholding may apply for non-resident partners
Credits for taxes paid to other states
```

### At-Risk and Basis Limitations

```
LOSS LIMITATION ORDERING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Losses flow through but may be limited:

Step 1: Tax Basis Limitation
        Cannot deduct loss exceeding tax basis

Step 2: At-Risk Limitation
        Cannot deduct loss exceeding at-risk amount

Step 3: Passive Activity Limitation
        Cannot offset active income if passive

Step 4: Excess Business Loss Limitation
        $289,000 single / $578,000 MFJ limit (2024)

Example:
Partnership loss: $100,000
Tax basis: $80,000
At-risk: $60,000
Passive income: $20,000

Step 1: Limited to $80,000 (basis)
Step 2: Limited to $60,000 (at-risk)
Step 3: Limited to $20,000 (passive income)
Suspended: $80,000
  - $20,000 at-risk suspension
  - $40,000 passive suspension
```

## Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs)

### MLP Taxation

```
WHAT ARE MLPs:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Publicly traded partnerships
Typically energy/infrastructure
Trade like stocks on exchanges
Taxed as partnerships (K-1)

TAX CHARACTERISTICS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Distributions often largely return of capital
Reduces basis (not immediately taxable)
Deferred taxation until sale
May create UBTI issues in retirement accounts

Example:
MLP purchase: $10,000
Annual distribution: $800 (8% yield)
Tax character: $200 income, $600 return of capital
Basis: $10,000 - $600 = $9,400

After 10 years:
Cumulative distributions: $8,000
Basis reduced: $10,000 - $6,000 = $4,000
Sell for $10,000: $6,000 gain (vs. original $0)

Tax deferral, not elimination
```

### MLP Considerations

```
ADVANTAGES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- High current yield
- Tax deferral
- Inflation hedge (often)
- Diversification

DISADVANTAGES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- K-1 complexity (late issuance)
- State tax filings in multiple states
- UBTI in retirement accounts (>$1,000)
- Basis tracking complexity
- Often concentrated sectors

WHERE TO HOLD:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Generally: Taxable accounts
           (Take advantage of ROC deferral)

Avoid: Tax-deferred accounts
       (UBTI issues, complexity not warranted)
```

## Mutual Fund and ETF Taxation

### Fund Distributions

```
TYPES OF FUND DISTRIBUTIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ordinary dividends: Interest, non-qualified dividends
Qualified dividends: Eligible for preferential rates
Short-term capital gains: Taxed as ordinary income
Long-term capital gains: Preferential rates
Return of capital: Reduces basis, not taxed

TIMING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Funds distribute gains/income near year-end
December distribution can create tax
Even if you just bought the fund
"Buying a distribution" - avoid late-year purchases

Example:
Buy $10,000 fund December 1
December 15: Fund distributes $500 LTCG
Your situation:
- Receive $500 distribution (reinvested)
- Owe tax on $500 LTCG (~$100 at 20%)
- NAV drops by $500
- Net position unchanged except tax bill
```

### ETF Tax Efficiency

```
WHY ETFs ARE MORE TAX-EFFICIENT:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Creation/Redemption Process:
- Authorized participants exchange baskets of securities
- Fund can shed low-basis shares without selling
- Capital gains minimized or eliminated

Mutual Fund Comparison:
- Must sell securities to meet redemptions
- Triggers capital gains for remaining shareholders
- You pay tax on others' redemptions

RESULT:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ETF capital gain distributions: Often zero
Mutual fund distributions: Often significant

Example:
$100,000 in S&P 500 fund
Annual LTCG distribution: 5% ($5,000)
Tax at 20%: $1,000/year
After 20 years: $20,000 in taxes paid

$100,000 in S&P 500 ETF
Annual LTCG distribution: ~0%
Tax: ~$0/year
All gains at sale: Control timing

Tax drag difference: ~0.5-1% annually
```

## Asset Location Strategy

### Optimal Placement

```
PRINCIPLE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Place tax-inefficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts
Place tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts

TAX-INEFFICIENT (Hold in Tax-Deferred):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- High-yield bonds
- REITs
- Actively managed funds (high turnover)
- Taxable bond funds
- TIPS (phantom income)

TAX-EFFICIENT (OK in Taxable):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Broad stock index ETFs
- Municipal bonds
- Tax-managed funds
- Buy-and-hold stocks
- Growth stocks (no dividends)

SPECIAL: Roth IRA
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tax-free growth forever
Place highest expected growth assets here
International stocks, small-cap growth
NOT bonds or low-growth assets
```

### Asset Location Example

```
PORTFOLIO: $1,000,000
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Asset Allocation:
60% Stocks (growth + dividends)
30% Bonds (taxable)
10% REITs

Account Breakdown:
$400,000 401(k)
$200,000 Roth IRA
$400,000 Taxable

OPTIMAL LOCATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
401(k) ($400,000):
- Taxable bonds: $300,000
- REITs: $100,000

Roth IRA ($200,000):
- Small-cap growth: $100,000
- International stocks: $100,000

Taxable ($400,000):
- US stock index ETF: $300,000
- Municipal bonds: $0 (already have enough stocks)
- Tax-managed international: $100,000

Result:
- High-tax assets sheltered
- Growth potential in Roth
- Tax-efficient assets in taxable
- Estimated annual tax savings: 0.5-0.7%
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Qualified dividends get preferential treatment** - 0-20% vs. ordinary rates
2. **REITs best in tax-deferred accounts** - Ordinary income distributions
3. **Municipal bonds for high-earners** - Calculate tax-equivalent yield
4. **Passive losses have limits** - Can only offset passive income
5. **K-1s add complexity** - But may offer tax advantages
6. **ETFs more tax-efficient than mutual funds** - Creation/redemption mechanism
7. **Asset location matters** - Match asset type to account type
8. **Avoid buying distributions** - Beware late-year fund purchases

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Tax-Equivalent Yield
Client in 35% bracket, 6% state tax. Calculate TEY for 3.5% in-state municipal bond.

### Problem 2: Passive Losses
Rental loss $30,000, passive income from LP $10,000, AGI $120,000. How much rental loss deductible?

### Problem 3: Asset Location
$500K 401(k), $200K Roth, $300K taxable. Target: 70% stocks, 20% bonds, 10% REITs. Design optimal location.
