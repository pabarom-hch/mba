## Exhibit 3: State Tax Implications

### New York to Texas Move

```
CURRENT STATE: New York
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Combined state/city rate: 12.7%
(State: 10.9%, NYC: ~1.8%)
Applies to all income types

NEW STATE: Texas
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Income tax rate: 0%
No state income tax on any income type

TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Income recognized BEFORE move: NY taxable
Income recognized AFTER move: Tax-free (state)

Key question: When does each component become taxable?
```

### Source Rules for Different Income

```
INCOME TYPE          NY TAXATION IF MOVE FIRST
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Stock options        Allocated based on service period
                     (12 years NY = 100% NY)

RSU vesting          Same allocation as options
                     (service period in NY)

Deferred comp        Complex - may follow residence
                     or may be sourced to NY
                     NY aggressive on NQDC

Signing bonus        Generally taxed to new state
                     (TX = $0 tax)

Consulting income    Sourced to where services performed
                     (If from TX = $0 NY tax)

Salary (new job)     Sourced to where work performed
                     (TX = $0 tax)
```

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Base salary: $750,000
Signing bonus: $500,000
Target bonus: $750,000 (paid Year 2)

Year 4: $750,000 (25%)
```

### Negotiation Opportunity

```
ITEMS UNDER DISCUSSION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Start date flexibility:
   - Earlier start = sooner Texas residency
   - Later start = capture TechVenture RSU vest

2. Signing bonus timing:
   - Could split: $250K now, $250K in Year 2
   - Spreads income, but reduces time value

3. RSU structure:
   - Could request accelerated vesting
   - Or front-loaded vest schedule

4. Tax gross-up:
   - Requesting gross-up on signing bonus
   - Would add ~$350,000 value

## Analysis Questions

### Part A: Departure Timing Optimization (25 points)

1. Calculate the total after-tax value under Scenarios A and B. Which produces better results and why?

2. The March 2024 RSU vesting ($600,000) is critical. What is the tax cost of staying through March versus leaving in January? Show the incremental analysis.

3. Should Rachel negotiate for accelerated vesting of Grants B and C? What would be fair consideration to offer TechVenture?

4. Design an optimal option exercise strategy. Should she exercise all options immediately upon departure or spread over the 12-month window?

### Part B: State Tax Planning (25 points)

1. Rachel's stock options are 100% NY-sourced due to 12 years of NY employment. What strategies, if any, could reduce this NY tax burden?

2. Analyze the deferred compensation sourcing. Research and apply NY's position on NQDC distributions to non-residents.

3. David plans to continue working in NYC but living in Texas. What are the tax implications of this arrangement?

4. Design the optimal relocation timing and sequence to minimize combined state taxes.

### Part C: New Employer Negotiation (25 points)

1. The signing bonus ($500,000) will be fully taxable as ordinary income. Should Rachel negotiate for:
   a) Tax gross-up
   b) Deferred payment
   c) Additional equity instead
   Analyze each option.

2. The $3M RSU grant vests equally over 4 years. Would a different vesting schedule provide tax advantages?

3. What is the value of starting in March (Scenario A) versus May (Scenario B) in terms of InnovateTech compensation? Consider delayed vesting and earlier salary.

4. If InnovateTech offers to "make whole" the forfeited TechVenture RSUs ($1.2M in Scenario B), how should this be structured?

### Part D: Multi-Year Tax Planning (25 points)

1. Create a 5-year income projection showing:
   - TechVenture deferred comp distributions
   - InnovateTech RSU vestings
   - Salary and bonus
   Design a bracket management strategy.

2. Given the high income years ahead, should Rachel focus on Roth conversions or traditional contributions? Analyze.

3. Both Rachel and David have significant 401(k) balances. Design a coordinated retirement and distribution strategy.

4. Rachel will have substantial Texas income going forward. How does this affect optimal asset location and investment strategy?

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Navigate executive transition tax complexities
- Optimize timing of departure-related income
- Apply state source rules to different income types
- Structure negotiated departure packages
- Coordinate with new employer compensation

### Key Insights

**The Timing Trade-off:**
```
Scenario A (Leave Immediately):
Forfeit: $1,800,000 in unvested RSUs
Save: Leave sooner, less NY tax on wages
Start earning InnovateTech sooner

Scenario B (Stay Through March):
Keep: $600,000 RSU + $300,000 bonus = $900,000
Cost: More NY taxable wages
       Delayed InnovateTech start

Net benefit of Scenario B: ~$556,500
(After incremental NY taxes)

Clear winner: Stay through March
```

**State Tax Reality Check:**
```
Options are 100% NY-sourced:
$3,975,000 × 12.7% = $504,825 NY tax
Cannot be avoided by moving

Deferred compensation:
NY position: Source to where earned
$1,850,000 × 12.7% = $234,950 NY tax over 5 years
May be unavoidable

Signing bonus and new salary:
$1,000,000+ at 0% Texas
Annual savings: $127,000/year

5-year state tax savings from move: ~$500,000
Less NY source rules: ~$250,000 net savings
```

**Option Exercise Strategy:**
```
Extended 12-month window:
Could exercise over time

Considerations:
- Stock price risk (if hold)
- Bracket management (spread over 2 years?)
- State tax timing
- Cash needs

Recommendation:
Exercise in Year 1 (higher income anyway)
2025 income will be lower
Can manage brackets better in future
Don't take stock price risk
```

### Model Solution Framework

**Recommended Strategy:**

```
1. DEPARTURE TIMING: Scenario B (April 2024)
   Stay through March 31
   Capture RSU vest + full bonus
   Net value: +$556,500 vs. Scenario A

2. RELOCATION SEQUENCE:
   - Week 1-2 April: Move to Texas
   - Establish domicile immediately
   - Update all documentation
   - Begin InnovateTech May 1

3. OPTION EXERCISE:
   - Exercise all options in April (after move)
   - Still NY-sourced, but administratively clean
   - Immediately sell (diversify)
   - Pay NY tax on exercise

4. NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES:
   - Accept current start date (May)
   - Request tax gross-up on signing bonus
   - Request accelerated RSU vesting (front-load)
   - Request make-whole for forfeited RSUs as cash or RSUs
```

**5-Year Projection:**

```
Year 1 (2024):
TechVenture: $1,262,500 (wages, RSU, bonus)
Options: $3,975,000
InnovateTech: $1,000,000
Deferred comp: $185,000
Total: ~$6,400,000
Federal: ~$2,400,000
NY (source): ~$600,000
Total tax: ~$3,000,000

Year 2 (2025):
InnovateTech: $1,500,000
RSU vest: $750,000
Deferred comp: $370,000
Total: ~$2,620,000
Federal: ~$900,000
NY (source): ~$47,000
Total tax: ~$947,000

Years 3-5: Similar to Year 2, declining DC
```

### Discussion Questions

1. How aggressive should executives be in negotiating departure packages? What leverage does Rachel have?

2. When should Rachel disclose her departure to InnovateTech versus TechVenture? Are there legal/ethical considerations?

3. David's continued NYC employment creates complexity. Should this affect family financial decisions?

4. At what value does it make sense to fight NY over source taxation? When is it more efficient to just pay?

5. How should Rachel balance career opportunity (joining competitor faster) versus financial optimization (capturing more TechVenture value)?

### Quantitative Exercises

1. Model the break-even: How much InnovateTech compensation would justify leaving TechVenture immediately?

2. Calculate the NPV of the deferred compensation under different state residence assumptions.

3. Build a scenario analysis for stock option exercise timing given stock price volatility.

4. Quantify the value of the 12-month vs. 90-day option exercise window.
