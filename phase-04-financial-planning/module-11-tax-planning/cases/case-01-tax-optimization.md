# Case Study: The Tax Optimization Puzzle

## Executive Summary

The Harrison family represents a complex tax planning scenario involving multiple income sources, significant charitable intent, concentrated stock, and state tax considerations. Thomas and Margaret Harrison, both 55, are successful professionals facing a surge in income due to a business sale and stock vesting. Your task is to develop a comprehensive tax minimization strategy that considers federal, state, and estate tax implications across multiple years.

**Key Question:** How can the Harrisons minimize their lifetime tax burden while achieving their philanthropic goals and maintaining financial security?

## Exhibit 5: State Tax Considerations

### California Residency Analysis

```
CALIFORNIA TAX BURDEN:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current year (without planning):       ~$580,000
5-year projection:                   ~$2,000,000+

RELOCATION CONSIDERATIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Potential destinations:
- Nevada (0% income tax)
- Texas (0% income tax)
- Washington (0% income tax)
- Florida (0% income tax)

Challenges:
- Children and grandchildren in Bay Area
- Thomas still has medical practice ties
- Social/community connections
- Climate preferences
- CA "exit audit" concerns

Partial-year residency:
- Must establish domicile in new state
- CA may tax income "sourced" to CA
- Practice sale likely still CA-taxed
```

### Source Rule Considerations

```
INCOME BY SOURCE (if relocate):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CA-sourced (still taxed by CA):
- Medical practice income (while still working)
- Practice sale gain (CA business)
- RSUs earned while CA resident (allocated)
- CA rental property income

Non-CA sourced (escape CA tax):
- Investment income (after residency change)
- Future RSU vesting (if truly non-resident)
- Board fees (if services outside CA)
- Future gains on securities
```

## Exhibit 6: Estate Considerations

### Current Estate Situation

```
FEDERAL ESTATE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Combined net worth:                   $24,550,000
2024 exemption (MFJ):                $27,220,000
Federal estate tax:                   $0 expected

CALIFORNIA ESTATE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CA has no state estate tax
Property tax reassessment at death
Prop 13 protection important

INCOME TAX ON APPRECIATED ASSETS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
If die holding appreciated assets: Stepped-up basis
Embedded gains forgiven:             ~$5,000,000+
Tax avoided:                         ~$1,000,000+

Planning consideration:
DON'T sell highly appreciated assets before death
Unless for diversification/concentration reasons
```

### Generational Transfer

```
PRIORITIES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Charitable: $5,000,000+ to various causes
2. Children: $3,000,000 each ($6,000,000 total)
3. Grandchildren (future): Education funds
4. Retain: Lifestyle and security

CURRENT STRUCTURE:

## Analysis Questions

### Part A: Current Year Optimization (25 points)

1. The Harrisons are facing $4.5M+ income this year. Develop a strategy to reduce current year taxes by at least $200,000. Consider:
   - Practice sale structuring
   - Charitable giving timing and asset selection
   - Retirement account maximization
   - Any available deductions

2. Calculate the tax savings from donating $1,000,000 in MedTech stock versus cash this year. Show the math.

3. Should Thomas consider an installment sale for the medical practice? Analyze the pros and cons and provide a recommendation.

4. What Roth conversion strategy, if any, makes sense given this year's high income?

### Part B: Multi-Year Tax Planning (25 points)

1. Create a 5-year income projection assuming:
   - Practice sale closes this year
   - RSUs vest as scheduled ($600K/year)
   - Regular income continues at $1.2M declining to $800K
   - Identify high and low income years

2. Design a charitable bunching strategy using a donor-advised fund. How much should be contributed and when?

3. Develop a systematic diversification plan for the $4.2M MedTech position. Consider:
   - Tax impact of selling
   - Charitable giving opportunities
   - 10b5-1 plan considerations
   - Target timeline

4. When is the optimal time for Roth conversions in your 5-year plan?

### Part C: State Tax Planning (25 points)

1. Quantify the potential California tax savings if the Harrisons relocate to Nevada after the practice sale. Consider source rules for different income types.

2. What are the requirements for establishing Nevada domicile that would withstand a California audit?

3. The Harrisons don't want to fully relocate but could spend significant time in Nevada. Design a "snowbird" strategy and assess its likely success.

4. If they stay in California, what strategies can minimize state tax impact?

### Part D: Integrated Estate and Tax Planning (25 points)

1. Given their charitable intent ($5M+), design an optimal giving structure. Compare:
   - Direct gifts
   - Donor-advised fund
   - Private foundation
   - Charitable remainder trust
   - Charitable lead trust

2. Create a concentrated stock management plan that balances:
   - Income tax minimization
   - Estate planning
   - Charitable goals
   - Diversification needs

3. Should the Harrisons implement a SLAT given current exemption levels? Analyze the trade-offs.

4. Design a comprehensive lifetime giving program to children and grandchildren.

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives

This case teaches students to:
- Integrate multiple tax planning strategies
- Balance current vs. future tax obligations
- Navigate state residency and source rules
- Optimize charitable giving for tax efficiency
- Coordinate income, gift, and estate tax planning

### Key Insights

**The Concentrated Stock Dilemma:**
```
MedTech stock: $4,200,000
Embedded gain: $3,400,000
Tax if sold: $809,200 (23.8%)
Tax if donated: $0 + deduction

Optimal approach:
- Donate $1M to DAF (Year 1)
- Donate $500K for CRT income stream
- Sell $500K/year for diversification
- Hold remainder for stepped-up basis

10-year diversification:
Sold: $5,000,000 (including appreciation)
Donated: $2,000,000
At death: $2,000,000 (stepped-up)
Total tax: ~$600,000 vs. $1,000,000 immediate
```

**State Tax Planning Reality:**
```
California exit:
- Must truly change domicile
- Cannot be "part-time" for tax purposes
- Audit risk high for wealthy taxpayers
- Some income still CA-sourced regardless

Realistic savings:
Full move: $300,000-$500,000/year
Partial move: $0 (CA will pursue full tax)

Trade-off: Savings vs. lifestyle/family
Many wealthy Californians choose to stay
```

**Charitable Giving Optimization:**
```
$5,000,000 charitable intent over lifetime

Suboptimal approach:
$200,000 cash/year × 25 years
Total tax savings: ~$2,500,000 (at 50% rate)

Optimal approach:
DAF contribution: $2,000,000 (appreciated stock)
- Avoid $400K capital gains tax
- $2M deduction in high-income year
CRT: $1,000,000 (income stream + remainder)
Annual giving: $80,000 average from DAF

Total tax benefit:
Deductions: ~$3,000,000
Gains avoided: ~$600,000
Total: ~$3,600,000

Additional benefit: $1.1M more to charity
```

### Model Solution Framework

**Current Year Strategy:**

```
1. Charitable DAF Contribution:
   Contribute $2,000,000 MedTech stock to DAF
   Deduction: $2,000,000
   Tax savings: $1,000,000 (50% combined rate)
   Gains avoided: $1,700,000 × 23.8% = $404,600
   Total benefit: $1,404,600

2. Practice Sale Structure:
   Consider installment sale (5-year term)
   Year 1: $600,000 gain recognized
   Years 2-5: $475,000/year
   Benefit: Spread into lower brackets
   Savings: ~$100,000 over lump sum

3. Retirement Maximization:
   Thomas 401(k): $30,500 + $7,500 catch-up
   Margaret 401(k): $30,500 + $7,500 catch-up
   Total: $76,000 deduction
   Savings: $38,000 (at 50% rate)

4. Current Year Reduction:
   Original tax: $2,203,790
   After DAF: -$1,000,000 tax + $404,600 = -$596,000
   After installment: -$100,000
   After 401(k): -$38,000
   New tax: ~$1,470,000
   Savings: ~$734,000
```

**5-Year Projection:**

```
Year 1 (Practice Sale Year):
Income: $2,500,000 (reduced by installment)
Strategy: Maximum charitable, full 401(k)

Year 2-3 (High RSU Years):
Income: ~$1,500,000
Strategy: Continue charitable from DAF
         Begin Roth conversions ($100K/year)

Year 4-5 (Semi-Retirement):
Income: ~$800,000
Strategy: Large Roth conversions ($300K/year)
         Fill lower brackets

Roth Conversion Total: $800,000
Tax cost: ~$250,000
Future tax saved: $400,000+ (at higher future rates)
```

### Discussion Questions

1. At what income level does relocating from California become financially compelling despite lifestyle sacrifices?

2. How do you counsel clients who have strong charitable intent but also want to minimize taxes? Are these goals in conflict?

3. When is an installment sale preferable to a lump sum, and what are the risks?

4. How should concentrated stock risk be weighted against the tax cost of diversification?

5. What ethical considerations arise when implementing aggressive state tax planning strategies?

### Quantitative Exercises

1. Model the after-tax benefit of a $3M charitable remainder trust versus outright donation.

2. Calculate break-even for California relocation given ongoing source-rule taxation.

3. Build a Monte Carlo simulation for MedTech stock concentration risk vs. diversification tax cost.

4. Compare private foundation vs. DAF for the Harrisons' charitable goals.
