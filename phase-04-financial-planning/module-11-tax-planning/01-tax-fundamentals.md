# Tax System Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure of the federal income tax system
- Calculate Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and taxable income
- Apply tax brackets to compute tax liability
- Distinguish between marginal and effective tax rates
- Navigate filing status implications

## Introduction

The U.S. federal income tax system is progressive, meaning higher income is taxed at higher rates. Understanding how income flows through the tax calculation—from gross income to tax liability—is fundamental to effective tax planning. This foundation enables identification of planning opportunities at each stage.

## Calculating Tax Liability

### Worked Example: Tax Calculation

```
Profile: Chen Family (MFJ)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wages (both spouses):              $380,000
Interest income:                    $12,000
Dividend income (qualified):        $15,000
Short-term capital gain:            $8,000
Long-term capital gain:             $45,000
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gross Income:                       $460,000

Adjustments:
401(k) contributions:              -$46,000
HSA contribution:                   -$8,300
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Adjusted Gross Income (AGI):        $405,700

Deductions (Itemized):
State/local taxes (SALT cap):      -$10,000
Mortgage interest:                 -$18,000
Charitable contributions:           -$8,000
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total Itemized:                     $36,000
Standard Deduction:                 $29,200
Use Itemized (higher)

Taxable Income: $405,700 - $36,000 = $369,700
```

### Tax Calculation

```
Ordinary Income Portion:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Taxable income:                     $369,700
Less: Qualified dividends           -$15,000
Less: Long-term capital gains       -$45,000
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ordinary taxable income:            $309,700

Tax on Ordinary Income:
10% on $23,200:                     $2,320
12% on $71,100:                     $8,532
22% on $106,750:                    $23,485
24% on $108,650:                    $26,076
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Subtotal:                           $60,413

Preferential Rate Income:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total taxable income: $369,700
"Stacks" on top of ordinary income
$309,700 already taxed at ordinary rates
Remaining bracket space at 15% LTCG rate:
  $583,750 - $309,700 = $274,050

LTCG + qualified dividends: $60,000
All fits in 15% bracket:
$60,000 × 15% = $9,000

Net Investment Income Tax:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MAGI: $405,700
Threshold: $250,000
Excess: $155,700
Investment income: $80,000 ($12K + $15K + $8K + $45K)
NIIT base: Lesser of $155,700 or $80,000 = $80,000
NIIT: $80,000 × 3.8% = $3,040

TOTAL TAX LIABILITY:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ordinary income tax:                $60,413
Capital gains/dividends tax:         $9,000
Net Investment Income Tax:           $3,040
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                              $72,453

Effective Rate: $72,453 / $460,000 = 15.8%
Marginal Rate (ordinary): 24%
Marginal Rate (LTCG): 15% + 3.8% = 18.8%
```

## Marginal vs. Effective Tax Rate

### Understanding the Difference

```
MARGINAL TAX RATE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Definition: Tax rate on the NEXT dollar of income
Use: Evaluating whether to earn additional income
     or claim additional deductions

Example:
Taxable income: $200,000 (MFJ)
Marginal rate: 24%
$1 more income → $0.24 more tax
$1 more deduction → $0.24 less tax

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Definition: Total tax / Total income
Use: Comparing overall tax burden
     Historical tracking
     International comparisons

Example:
Total income: $200,000
Total federal tax: $30,000
Effective rate: 15%

WHY THE DIFFERENCE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Progressive system: Lower brackets taxed at lower rates
Deductions: Reduce taxable income
Credits: Reduce tax directly
Result: Effective always lower than marginal
```

### Marginal Rate Stack

```
Combined Marginal Rates (High-Income MFJ):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Federal income tax:           37.0%
Net Investment Income Tax:     3.8%
State income tax (CA):        13.3%
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Combined marginal rate:       54.1%

But: Effective rate much lower
     SALT deduction (limited to $10K) provides some offset
     Most income taxed at lower brackets

Planning Implication:
At 54% marginal rate:
- $1 deduction saves $0.54
- Deferral very valuable
- Tax-exempt income very valuable
```

## Filing Status

### Status Options and Implications

```
STATUS          STANDARD DED    BRACKETS    KEY REQUIREMENTS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Single          $14,600        Narrowest   Unmarried, no dependents
MFJ             $29,200        Widest      Married, both report
MFS             $14,600        Narrow      Married, report separately
HoH             $21,900        Favorable   Unmarried w/dependent
QSS             $29,200        MFJ rates   Widow(er) w/dependent (2 yrs)

MFJ vs. MFS Consideration:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MFJ usually better because:
- Wider brackets
- Higher standard deduction
- More credits available
- Lower overall tax

MFS might be better if:
- One spouse has high medical expenses (7.5% AGI floor)
- Student loan repayment (income-driven)
- Liability concerns
- Separate property states
```

### Marriage Penalty/Bonus

```
Marriage Penalty: When MFJ tax > sum of two singles
Marriage Bonus: When MFJ tax < sum of two singles

When Penalty Occurs:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Two similar high incomes
- EITC phase-out
- AMT threshold differences

When Bonus Occurs:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- One high earner, one low/no income
- Doubling of lower brackets
- Standard deduction doubles

Example:
Two individuals each earning $200,000
Single tax (each): ~$40,000
Total: $80,000

Married (combined $400,000):
MFJ tax: ~$84,000
Marriage penalty: ~$4,000
```

## Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

### AMT Overview

```
PURPOSE: Ensure high-income taxpayers pay minimum tax
         Despite preferences and deductions

CALCULATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Start: Taxable income
Add back: AMT preferences
        - State/local tax deduction
        - Miscellaneous itemized (pre-2018)
        - Personal exemptions (pre-2018)
        - Certain interest
        - ISO spread at exercise
Equals: AMT income (AMTI)
Minus: AMT exemption
Equals: AMT taxable amount
Apply: AMT rates (26%/28%)
Equals: Tentative minimum tax
Compare: To regular tax
Pay: Higher amount

2024 AMT Exemptions:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Single: $85,700 (phases out $609,350 - $952,150)
MFJ: $133,300 (phases out $1,218,700 - $1,751,900)

AMT Rates:
26% on first $232,600 ($116,300 MFS)
28% on excess
```

### Who Pays AMT

```
Common AMT Triggers:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. High state/local taxes
   - SALT deduction eliminated for AMT
   - $10K regular cap already limits this

2. Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)
   - Exercise spread is AMT preference
   - Can trigger large AMT liability
   - Planning critical

3. Large capital gains
   - Can push into AMT exemption phase-out
   - But LTCG rates same under AMT

4. Interest from private activity bonds
   - Tax-exempt for regular, not for AMT

Post-TCJA Reality:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AMT affects fewer taxpayers since 2018
Higher exemption amounts
SALT cap limits regular tax benefit
But still relevant for:
- Very high income
- ISO exercises
- Private activity bonds
```

## MAGI: Modified Adjusted Gross Income

### Different Definitions

```
MAGI varies by provision:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PROVISION          AGI PLUS...
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IRA deduction      Excluded foreign income,
                   adoption assistance

Roth IRA           Excluded foreign income,
contribution       deductible IRA contribution

ACA premium        Tax-exempt interest,
credits            non-taxable Social Security

Medicare           Tax-exempt interest
IRMAA

Passive loss       Same as AGI typically
limitation

Common Thread: MAGI adds back certain exclusions
               to prevent "gaming" income thresholds
```

### Key MAGI Thresholds (2024)

```
PROVISION                    MFJ THRESHOLD
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Roth IRA contribution        $230,000 - $240,000
Traditional IRA deduction    $123,000 - $143,000
(covered by plan)
Child tax credit phase-out   $400,000
NIIT applies                 $250,000
ACA subsidy cliff            ~4x FPL (~$125,000)
Medicare IRMAA               $206,000 (2-year lookback)
Capital loss ($3K) limit     N/A (all incomes)
```

## Tax Planning Principles

### Timing Strategies

```
DEFER INCOME (when beneficial):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Why: Delay tax payment, invest difference
     May be in lower bracket later
     Time value of money

Methods:
- Maximize 401(k)/IRA contributions
- Defer bonus to next year
- Installment sales
- Delay exercising stock options
- Defer income recognition

ACCELERATE INCOME (when beneficial):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Why: Expected higher rates in future
     Currently in low bracket
     Use up expiring losses

Methods:
- Roth conversions in low-income year
- Realize capital gains before rate increase
- Accelerate bonuses if leaving high-tax state
- Exercise options before company event

DEFER DEDUCTIONS (when beneficial):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Why: More valuable at higher future rate
     Cannot use this year (below standard)

Methods:
- Delay charitable contributions
- Delay property tax payment
- Time medical procedures

ACCELERATE DEDUCTIONS (when beneficial):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Why: High income this year
     Rates may decrease
     Bunching above standard deduction

Methods:
- Prepay state taxes (subject to limits)
- Bunch charitable contributions
- Prepay mortgage interest (limited)
- Time medical procedures
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Progressive system** - Marginal rates increase with income; effective rate lower
2. **AGI is the gateway** - Many deductions, credits, and limits key off AGI
3. **Income type matters** - Capital gains and qualified dividends get preferential rates
4. **Filing status affects brackets** - MFJ usually optimal, but not always
5. **AMT still exists** - Particularly relevant for ISO exercises
6. **MAGI varies by provision** - Know which definition applies
7. **Timing is powerful** - Shifting income/deductions between years creates opportunity
8. **Marginal rate for decisions** - Use marginal rate when evaluating planning choices

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Tax Calculation
Calculate federal tax liability for: Single filer, $175,000 wages, $10,000 qualified dividends, $5,000 LTCG, takes standard deduction.

### Problem 2: Marginal Rate
Client is MFJ with $400,000 taxable income. What is their marginal rate on (a) additional ordinary income? (b) additional LTCG?

### Problem 3: Filing Status
Married couple: Spouse A earns $300,000, Spouse B has $50,000 medical expenses. Compare MFJ vs. MFS for the 7.5% AGI medical floor.
