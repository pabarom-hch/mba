## Introduction

Estate and gift taxes represent a wealth transfer tax on the movement of assets between generations. While fewer than 1% of estates owe federal estate tax due to the high exemption amounts, understanding these rules remains crucial for wealthy clients. More importantly, gift tax planning offers opportunities for all clients to transfer wealth efficiently during their lifetimes.

---

## The Unified Transfer Tax System

### How the System Works

```
UNIFIED SYSTEM:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gift Tax + Estate Tax = One System

Same exemption covers both:
- Use exemption for lifetime gifts
- OR use at death for estate
- Or combination of both

Same rates: 18% to 40%
Top rate (40%) applies above $1,000,000 in taxable transfers

2024 EXEMPTION AMOUNTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Federal estate/gift exemption: $13,610,000 per person
Married couple (with portability): $27,220,000

Annual exclusion (gift tax): $18,000 per recipient
                            ($36,000 with gift-splitting)

SCHEDULED CHANGES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current exemption: ~$13.6M (2024, indexed)
After 2025: Reverts to ~$6.5-7M (indexed from 2017 level)
Unless Congress acts
```

### Gift Tax Overview

```
WHEN GIFT TAX APPLIES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Transfer of property for less than full consideration
Donor pays tax (not recipient)
Recipients include individuals, trusts

EXCLUDABLE GIFTS (No tax, no reporting):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Annual Exclusion: $18,000 per donee (2024)
2. Tuition: Unlimited if paid directly to institution
3. Medical: Unlimited if paid directly to provider
4. Gifts to spouse: Unlimited (if US citizen)
5. Charitable gifts: Unlimited

TAXABLE GIFTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Above annual exclusion, must file Form 709
Uses lifetime exemption (no current tax unless exceed)
Gift-splitting: Married couples can elect to split
                Effectively $36,000 per donee

Example:
Parent gifts $100,000 to child
Annual exclusion: $18,000
Taxable gift: $82,000
Uses $82,000 of lifetime exemption
Tax due (if under $13.6M lifetime): $0
```

### Estate Tax Overview

```
WHAT'S INCLUDED IN TAXABLE ESTATE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- All property owned at death
- Life insurance on decedent's life (if owned)
- Retirement accounts
- Trust assets if retained control
- Jointly owned property (survivor's portion excluded)
- Previously gifted property with retained interest

DEDUCTIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Marital deduction (unlimited to spouse)
- Charitable deduction
- Debts and expenses
- State death taxes paid

CALCULATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gross estate
- Deductions
= Taxable estate
+ Adjusted taxable gifts (lifetime)
= Tentative tax base
× Tax rates
- Unified credit
= Estate tax due
```

---

## Annual Exclusion Gifting

### Strategic Annual Exclusion

```
POWER OF ANNUAL EXCLUSION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
$18,000 per donee × unlimited donees × every year
No gift tax return required
No use of lifetime exemption

Example: Large Family
Parents (married): Can split gifts
Children: 3
Grandchildren: 8
Spouses of children: 3
Total recipients: 14

Annual transfer: $36,000 × 14 = $504,000/year
10 years: $5,040,000 transferred
Tax: $0
Exemption used: $0
```

### Annual Exclusion Techniques

```
CASH GIFTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Simplest method
Check or transfer
Document date and amount

529 PLAN SUPERFUNDING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Special rule: 5 years of exclusions in one year
2024: $18,000 × 5 = $90,000 per donor per beneficiary
Married couple: $180,000 per beneficiary
No additional gifts to same donee for 5 years
Great for education funding

CRUMMEY TRUSTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trust gifts qualify for annual exclusion if:
- Beneficiary has immediate right to withdraw
- Notified of contribution
- Reasonable time to withdraw (30-60 days)

Allows gifts in trust while using annual exclusion
Life insurance trusts commonly use Crummey powers

GIFTS OF APPRECIATING ASSETS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gift stock worth $18,000 today
If grows to $50,000: All appreciation outside estate
Better than gifting cash (which stays at $18,000)
But: Donee gets carryover basis (income tax issue)
```

---

## Lifetime Exemption Strategies

### Using Exemption During Life vs. At Death

```
ADVANTAGES OF LIFETIME GIFTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Appreciation removed from estate
   Gift $1M today → grows to $3M
   Only $1M counts against exemption
   $2M appreciation never taxed

2. Income shifted to lower-bracket recipients
   Gift income-producing asset
   Future income taxed to donee

3. Certainty vs. legislative risk
   Use exemption while high
   May be reduced in future

4. Witness recipients enjoy gifts

ADVANTAGES OF WAITING UNTIL DEATH:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Stepped-up basis
   Appreciated assets reset to FMV
   Donee pays no income tax on gain

2. Retain control and flexibility
   May need assets for care
   Can change estate plan

3. No gift if exemption lowered
   If die with lower exemption, no clawback
   (Under current rules)
```

### Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT)

```
WHAT IS A SLAT:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Irrevocable trust created by one spouse
Other spouse is beneficiary
Uses donor spouse's exemption
Trustee can distribute to beneficiary spouse

BENEFITS:
- Removes assets from both estates
- Uses exemption now (while high)
- Indirect access via spouse
- Gift tax exclusion for present interest

EXAMPLE:
Husband creates SLAT with $10,000,000
Wife is beneficiary
Uses $10M of husband's exemption
Wife can receive distributions
Assets grow outside both estates

CAUTION:
- Reciprocal trust doctrine (can't mirror each other)
- Divorce risk (spouse access ends)
- Donor cannot be beneficiary

PLANNING:
Create SLATs for each spouse
Make them different (terms, trustees, timing)
Provides some indirect access
"Have cake and eat it too"
```

## Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax

### GSTT Overview

```
PURPOSE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Prevent wealthy families from skipping estate tax
by transferring directly to grandchildren/beyond

RATE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Flat 40% (on top of gift/estate tax!)
Can result in effective 64% rate (40% + 40% of 60%)

GST EXEMPTION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Same as estate/gift exemption: $13,610,000 (2024)
Separate allocation (not unified with estate)
Must affirmatively allocate on gift tax return

SKIP PERSONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Grandchild or more remote descendant
Person 37.5+ years younger (non-relative)
Trust for skip persons
```

### GSTT Transfer Types

```
DIRECT SKIP:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Gift directly to skip person
GSTT due at transfer
Exemption can shelter

Example:
Grandmother gifts $1,000,000 to grandchild
Above annual exclusion: $982,000 taxable
GSTT: $982,000 × 40% = $392,800 (if no exemption)
With exemption: $0

TAXABLE TERMINATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trust interest terminates to skip person
Example: Trust for child, then to grandchild
When child dies, termination occurs
GSTT applies to trust assets

TAXABLE DISTRIBUTION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Distribution from trust to skip person
While non-skip person has interest
Example: Trust for child, distribution to grandchild
GSTT on distribution amount
```

### Dynasty Trust

```
WHAT IS A DYNASTY TRUST:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Long-term trust (perpetual in some states)
Allocate GST exemption fully
Assets grow GST-free forever

EXAMPLE:
Create trust with $13,610,000
Allocate GST exemption
Trust grows at 7% for 100 years
Value: $13.6M × (1.07)^100 = $11+ billion
Never subject to estate tax at any generation
Never subject to GSTT

STATE CONSIDERATIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Some states abolished Rule Against Perpetuities:
DE, SD, NV, AK, NH, WY, and others
Trust can last forever
Significant long-term wealth preservation
```

---

## Valuation Discounts

### Minority and Marketability Discounts

```
CONCEPT:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fair market value ≠ proportionate share of total
Minority interest: Less control = less value
Lack of marketability: Can't easily sell = less value

TYPICAL DISCOUNTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Minority discount: 15-35%
Marketability discount: 15-35%
Combined discount: 25-45%

EXAMPLE: Family Limited Partnership
Family business/investments worth $10,000,000
Parents gift 30% LP interest to child
Pro rata value: $3,000,000

With discounts:
Minority (25%): $3,000,000 × 0.75 = $2,250,000
Marketability (20%): $2,250,000 × 0.80 = $1,800,000

Discounted value: $1,800,000
Gift tax value: $1,800,000 (uses less exemption)
Discount: 40%

CAUTION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IRS scrutinizes aggressive discounts
Must have legitimate business purpose
Cannot be solely for tax avoidance
Proper appraisal required
2704 regulations may limit some discounts
```

---

## Charitable Planning

### Charitable Remainder Trusts

```
CHARITABLE REMAINDER TRUST (CRT):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Income to donor (or others) for life/term
Remainder to charity at end
Immediate income tax deduction (PV of remainder)
Trust sells assets tax-free (no capital gains)

TYPES:
CRAT: Fixed annuity (5-50% of initial value)
CRUT: Fixed percentage of annual value (5-50%)

EXAMPLE:
Asset: $1,000,000 stock (basis $200,000)
CRT pays 5% annually
Donor age 70

If sell stock:
Capital gains tax: $160,000
Net: $840,000
Income at 5%: $42,000/year

With CRUT:
No capital gains tax
Invest full $1,000,000
Income at 5%: $50,000/year
Plus: Charitable deduction ~$350,000
Tax savings (35%): ~$122,500
```

### Charitable Lead Trusts

```
CHARITABLE LEAD TRUST (CLT):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Charity receives income for term
Remainder to family at end
"Freeze" asset value for transfer tax

TYPES:
Grantor CLT: Donor gets income tax deduction upfront
Non-grantor CLT: No income tax deduction, better transfer tax

EXAMPLE: Zeroed-Out CLT
Transfer $5,000,000 to CLT
Charity receives 6% annually for 20 years
Remainder to children

If assets grow at 8%:
Annual to charity: $300,000
After 20 years to charity: $6,000,000
Remainder to children: ~$5,000,000+

Gift value: ~$0 (zeroed out)
Uses no exemption
$5M+ to children tax-free
(If growth exceeds IRS assumed rate)
```

Can apply with or without estate tax
```

### State Planning Strategies

```
RESIDENCY PLANNING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Consider domicile change to no-estate-tax state
FL, TX, NV, WY common destinations
Must establish true domicile
Can save millions in state estate tax

CREDIT SHELTER TRUST:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fund to state exemption amount
Passes estate-tax-free
Remainder to spouse (or marital trust)

Example (MA with $2M exemption):
Estate: $5,000,000
CST: $2,000,000 (to children at second death)
Marital: $3,000,000 (to spouse outright or in trust)
State tax at first death: $0
At second death: Only survivor's assets taxed
```

## Worked Example: Estate Planning

### Profile

```
The Rothschild Family
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Harold (78) and Martha (75)
Combined estate: $28,000,000
Children: 2
Grandchildren: 4
Current exemption: $13,610,000 each

Assets:
Primary home: $2,000,000
Investment portfolio: $18,000,000 (basis $8M)
Business interest (FLP): $6,000,000
Life insurance: $2,000,000 (owned by Harold)
```

### Estate Tax Analysis

```
WITHOUT PLANNING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Harold dies first:
Gross estate: $28,000,000
Marital deduction: -$28,000,000 (all to Martha)
Taxable estate: $0
Estate tax: $0
But: All in Martha's estate

Martha dies second:
Gross estate: $28,000,000 (plus growth)
Exemption: $27,220,000 (Harold's portability + hers)
Taxable: $780,000+
Estate tax: ~$312,000+

WITH BASIC PLANNING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Transfer life insurance to ILIT
   Removes $2,000,000 from estate
   Premium gifts use annual exclusion

2. Annual exclusion gifts
   $36,000 × 6 family members = $216,000/year
   Over 5 years: $1,080,000 out of estate

3. Discounted FLP gifts
   Gift 30% FLP interest: $1,800,000 (discounted from $2.58M)
   Uses Harold's exemption

Estate now: $28M - $2M - $1.08M - $1.8M = $23.12M
Below combined exemption: No estate tax

ADDITIONAL ADVANCED PLANNING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. SLAT for Martha
   Harold creates SLAT: $10,000,000
   Martha is beneficiary (indirect access)
   Uses Harold's exemption now
   Growth outside both estates

5. Dynasty trust for grandchildren
   Fund with $3,000,000
   Allocate GST exemption
   Benefits multiple generations

Result: Estate tax = $0
        Assets protected from future exemption reduction
        Multi-generational wealth transfer
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Unified system** - Gift and estate tax share one exemption ($13.6M in 2024)
2. **Annual exclusion is powerful** - $18,000 per donee, unlimited donees
3. **Lifetime gifts remove appreciation** - $1M gift that grows to $5M = only $1M exemption used
4. **Stepped-up basis at death** - Income tax benefit of holding until death
5. **GSTT is expensive** - 40% flat rate on top of other transfer taxes
6. **Valuation discounts available** - Minority/marketability for FLP interests
7. **State taxes matter** - Many states have lower exemptions
8. **Exemption may decrease** - Current law expires after 2025
