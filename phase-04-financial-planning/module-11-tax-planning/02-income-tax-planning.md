## Introduction

Income tax planning involves strategically timing income and deductions to minimize lifetime tax liability. Effective planning requires understanding not just current year taxes, but projecting future income, tax rate changes, and life events. The goal is to pay the least legal tax across your lifetime, not necessarily in any single year.

---

## Income Timing Strategies

### Deferral vs. Acceleration

```
WHEN TO DEFER INCOME:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✓ Higher marginal rate this year than expected next
✓ Near retirement with lower future income
✓ Unusual spike in income this year
✓ Expecting move to lower-tax state
✓ Time value of money favors delay

WHEN TO ACCELERATE INCOME:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✓ Lower marginal rate this year than expected next
✓ Tax rate increases expected (legislation)
✓ Have losses to offset gains
✓ Leaving high-tax state for low-tax state
✓ Need income for mortgage qualification

NEUTRAL FACTORS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
? Investment returns vs. tax deferral benefit
? Uncertainty of future rates
? Cash flow needs
```

### Income Deferral Techniques

```
EMPLOYMENT INCOME:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Maximize 401(k)/403(b) Contributions
   2024 limit: $23,000 + $7,500 catch-up (50+)
   Reduces current taxable income dollar-for-dollar

2. Deferred Compensation Plans
   NQDC: Defer salary/bonus to future years
   409A rules: Must elect before year earned

3. Bonus Timing
   Cash-basis employees: Tax when received
   Request December bonus paid in January

4. Stock Options
   NSOs: Tax at exercise on spread
   ISOs: Tax at sale (AMT at exercise)
   Control exercise timing

SELF-EMPLOYMENT INCOME:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Delay Billing
   Cash-basis: Income when received
   Bill late December for January payment

2. SEP-IRA/Solo 401(k)
   Contribute up to 25% of net self-employment income
   Solo 401(k): Employee + employer contributions

3. Installment Sales
   Spread recognition over payment period
   Interest element taxed separately

INVESTMENT INCOME:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Tax-Deferred Accounts
   Traditional IRA/401(k): Grow tax-free until withdrawal

2. Delay Dividend Receipt
   Buy after ex-dividend date
   Avoid "buying" the dividend

3. Municipal Bonds
   Tax-exempt at federal level
   Often state-exempt if in-state
```

## Deduction Optimization

### Above-the-Line vs. Below-the-Line

```
ABOVE-THE-LINE (Adjustments to Income):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Benefit: Reduces AGI directly
         Available regardless of itemizing
         Affects AGI-based limits

Key Above-the-Line Deductions:
- Traditional IRA contributions ($7,000 + $1,000 catch-up)
- HSA contributions ($4,150 single, $8,300 family)
- Student loan interest ($2,500 max)
- Self-employment tax (50%)
- Self-employed health insurance
- SEP-IRA contributions
- Educator expenses ($300)
- Alimony paid (pre-2019 agreements)

BELOW-THE-LINE (Itemized Deductions):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Benefit: Only if total > standard deduction
         Subject to limitations

Key Itemized Deductions:
- State and local taxes (max $10,000)
- Mortgage interest (on up to $750K debt)
- Charitable contributions
- Medical expenses (>7.5% AGI)
- Casualty losses (federally declared disasters only)
```

### Standard vs. Itemized Analysis

```
2024 Standard Deductions:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Single: $14,600
MFJ: $29,200
HoH: $21,900
Additional 65+/blind: $1,550 (MFJ), $1,950 (Single)

Decision Framework:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                        Standard    Itemize
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SALT paid: $10,000      $14,600     $10,000
Mortgage interest: $8K              $8,000
Charity: $3,000                     $3,000
                        ─────────   ─────────
Total                   $14,600     $21,000

Itemize: $21,000 > $14,600 ✓

Additional Value: $6,400 more deductions
Tax savings at 24%: $1,536
```

### Bunching Strategy

```
CONCEPT: Alternate years of itemizing and standard
         Bunch deductions in itemizing years

Example: Single filer with annual expenses:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SALT: $8,000
Mortgage interest: $6,000
Charity: $4,000
Total: $18,000

Without Bunching:
Year 1: Itemize $18,000 (saves $3,400 vs. standard)
Year 2: Itemize $18,000 (saves $3,400)
2-year savings: $6,800

With Bunching:
Year 1: Pay 2 years charity + prepay items = $26,000
        Itemize: $26,000 (savings vs. $14,600 standard)
Year 2: No charity, minimal itemized = $14,000
        Standard: $14,600 (use standard)

Year 1 deduction: $26,000
Year 2 deduction: $14,600
Total: $40,600 vs. $36,000 without bunching
Additional deduction: $4,600
At 22% rate: $1,012 tax savings
```

### Charitable Giving Optimization

```
DIRECT CASH GIFTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Deduction: Amount given
Limit: 60% of AGI (cash to public charities)
Carryforward: 5 years for excess

APPRECIATED SECURITIES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Deduction: Fair market value
Limit: 30% of AGI
Benefit: Avoid capital gains tax
         Get FMV deduction
         Double tax benefit

Example:
Stock purchased: $10,000
Current value: $30,000
Gain: $20,000

If sell and donate cash:
Capital gains tax (20%): $4,000
Donate: $26,000 (after-tax)
Deduction: $26,000

If donate stock directly:
Capital gains tax: $0
Deduction: $30,000
Additional benefit: $4,000 + $4,000 = $8,000

DONOR-ADVISED FUNDS (DAF):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
How it works:
1. Contribute to DAF (immediate deduction)
2. Invest and grow tax-free
3. Recommend grants over time

Benefits for bunching:
- Large deduction in high-income year
- Distribute to charities over many years
- Simplifies record-keeping
- Can contribute appreciated assets

QUALIFIED CHARITABLE DISTRIBUTIONS (QCD):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Who: Age 70½+
From: Traditional IRA
Amount: Up to $105,000 (2024, indexed)
Benefit: Satisfies RMD
         Excludes from income (better than deduction!)
         Reduces AGI-based calculations

QCD vs. Deduction:
Income: $100,000
RMD: $20,000
Regular approach: $120,000 AGI, $20,000 deduction = $100,000 taxable
QCD approach: $100,000 AGI (no RMD income)

QCD reduces AGI, which may:
- Lower Medicare IRMAA
- Reduce SS taxation
- Improve other AGI-based items
```

## Tax Credits

### Credits vs. Deductions

```
DEDUCTION: Reduces taxable income
           Value = Deduction × Marginal rate
           $1,000 deduction at 24% = $240 savings

CREDIT: Reduces tax directly
        Value = Credit amount (dollar-for-dollar)
        $1,000 credit = $1,000 savings

Credits are generally MORE valuable
But: Some credits are refundable, others not
     Some phase out at high income
```

### Key Tax Credits

```
CHILD TAX CREDIT (2024):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Amount: $2,000 per qualifying child under 17
Refundable: Up to $1,700
Phase-out: Begins $400,000 MFJ, $200,000 other
           $50 reduction per $1,000 over threshold

CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE CREDIT:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For: Work-related childcare (under 13) or dependent care
Max expenses: $3,000 (one), $6,000 (two+)
Credit rate: 20-35% of expenses (based on income)
High income: 20% rate
Max credit: $600 (one), $1,200 (two+)

EDUCATION CREDITS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
American Opportunity Credit:
- Up to $2,500/student (4 years max)
- 40% refundable ($1,000)
- Phase-out: $160,000-$180,000 MFJ

Lifetime Learning Credit:
- Up to $2,000/return

- Phase-out: $160,000-$180,000 MFJ

RETIREMENT SAVER'S CREDIT:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For: Lower-income retirement savers
Credit: 10-50% of contributions (max $2,000)
Max credit: $1,000 ($2,000 MFJ)
Income limit: $76,500 MFJ (2024)

FOREIGN TAX CREDIT:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For: Taxes paid to foreign governments
Purpose: Avoid double taxation
Limit: US tax on foreign-source income
Carryback: 1 year
Carryforward: 10 years
```

---

## State and Local Tax Planning

### SALT Deduction Limitation

```
THE RULE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
State and local taxes: Max $10,000 deduction
Includes:
- State income tax (or sales tax election)
- Local income tax
- Property taxes

Impact:
High-tax state residents: Capped below actual taxes
Low-tax state residents: May deduct full amount

Example:
California resident:
State income tax: $50,000
Property tax: $25,000
Total SALT: $75,000
Deductible: $10,000 (cap)
"Lost" deduction: $65,000
At 37% rate: $24,050 additional federal tax
```

### State Tax Strategies

```
RELOCATING TO LOWER-TAX STATE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before move:
- Accelerate income (taxed at old, lower federal)
- Exercise stock options
- Realize capital gains if new state has no income tax
- Roth conversions

After move:
- Defer income where possible
- Establish domicile thoroughly
- Avoid "statutory residency" in old state

Domicile factors:
- Driver's license
- Voter registration
- Where time is spent
- Professional licenses
- Will and trusts
- Bank accounts

STATE TAX COMPARISON (2024):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No income tax: AK, FL, NV, NH*, SD, TN*, TX, WA, WY
(*dividends/interest only)

High income tax:
California: 13.3%
New York: 10.9%
New Jersey: 10.75%
Hawaii: 11%

Flat tax:
Colorado: 4.4%
Illinois: 4.95%
North Carolina: 5.25%
```

### Workarounds and Planning

```
PASS-THROUGH ENTITY ELECTION (PTET):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Many states allow S-Corps and partnerships to elect
to pay state tax at entity level

Effect:
- Deductible by entity (not subject to SALT cap)
- Owner gets credit on personal return
- Effective workaround for SALT limitation
- Must evaluate state-by-state

CHARITABLE SALT WORKAROUND:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Some states offer credit against state tax for
contributions to designated charities/funds

IRS challenged but some programs survive
Must analyze specific state program
```

## Self-Employment Tax Planning

### Self-Employment Tax Overview

```
COMPONENTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Social Security: 12.4% (up to wage base $168,600)
Medicare: 2.9% (unlimited)
Additional Medicare: 0.9% (over $250,000 MFJ)

Total rate: 15.3% (up to wage base)
            3.8% (on excess)

Applied to: 92.35% of net self-employment income

Deduction: 50% of SE tax is above-the-line deduction
```

### Minimizing Self-Employment Tax

```
ENTITY SELECTION (S-Corporation):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Strategy: Pay "reasonable salary" subject to FICA
          Remainder as distribution (no SE tax)

Example:
Net business income: $300,000

Schedule C (Sole Prop):
SE income: $300,000 × 92.35% = $277,050
SE tax: $21,824 (SS on $168,600) + $8,034 (Medicare) = $29,858
Above-line deduction: $14,929
Net SE tax: $29,858

S-Corp with $150,000 salary:
FICA on salary: $11,475 (employer + employee combined)
No SE tax on $150,000 distribution
Total: $22,950 payroll taxes

Savings: ~$7,000/year

Caveat:
- Must pay "reasonable" salary
- Additional compliance costs
- State considerations
```

---

## Estimated Tax and Withholding

### Avoiding Underpayment Penalty

```
SAFE HARBOR RULES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No penalty if paid (through withholding + estimates):

Option 1: 90% of current year tax
Option 2: 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI >$150K)

Strategy:
- If income volatile: Use prior year safe harbor
- If income stable/growing: Use current year estimate

INCREASING WITHHOLDING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Benefit: Treated as paid evenly throughout year
         (unlike estimates which are quarter-by-quarter)

Use: If behind on estimates late in year
     Increase W-4 withholding significantly in Q4
     Avoid quarterly underpayment penalties
```

---

## Worked Example: Comprehensive Planning

### Profile

```
Client: Thompson Family (MFJ)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
W-2 wages: $400,000
Self-employment income: $100,000
Investment income: $50,000 (LTCG)
Age: Both 50
State: New York (10.9% top rate)

Current situation:
- Not maximizing retirement contributions
- Making direct cash charitable gifts
- Paying SALT over $10K cap
```

### Planning Opportunities

```
OPPORTUNITY 1: Maximize Retirement Contributions
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current: Contributing $15,000 to 401(k)
Available:
- 401(k): $23,000 + $7,500 catch-up = $30,500 each
- SEP-IRA: $100,000 × 25% = $25,000

New contributions: $30,500 + $30,500 + $25,000 = $86,000
Additional deduction: $86,000 - $15,000 = $71,000
Tax savings at 35%: $24,850

OPPORTUNITY 2: Charitable Bunching with DAF
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Current: $10,000 charity/year, itemizing
Plan: $50,000 to DAF in Year 1 (5 years of giving)
      Recommend $10,000 grants annually

Year 1: $50,000 deduction (bunch with SALT + mortgage)
Years 2-5: Standard deduction ($29,200)

5-year deductions without bunching:
$10,000 × 5 = $50,000 total charitable
5 years × $29,200 standard = $146,000 (if not itemizing)
Or itemized at roughly $50K/year

5-year deductions with bunching:
Year 1: $10,000 SALT + $15,000 mortgage + $50,000 charity = $75,000
Years 2-5: $29,200 × 4 = $116,800
Total: $191,800

Additional deduction over 5 years: ~$15,000
Tax savings at 35%: ~$5,250

OPPORTUNITY 3: Qualified Charitable Distribution (Future)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
At age 70½: Switch to QCDs from IRA
Reduces AGI rather than claiming deduction
Benefit for IRMAA, SS taxation, other AGI limits

OPPORTUNITY 4: Donate Appreciated Stock
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Have $100K stock with $60K basis
Donate $50K of stock (basis $30K) to DAF

Capital gain avoided: $20,000
Tax savings (20% + 3.8%): $4,760
Deduction value (35%): $17,500
Total benefit: $22,260 vs. $10,500 if gave cash

TOTAL ANNUAL TAX SAVINGS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Retirement contributions: $24,850
Charitable optimization: ~$5,000/year effective
Stock donation: $4,760 additional
Total: ~$35,000+ annual savings
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Timing is everything** - Shifting income and deductions between years creates opportunity
2. **Bunch when possible** - Alternate itemizing and standard deduction years
3. **Credits beat deductions** - Dollar-for-dollar vs. marginal rate reduction
4. **Above-the-line is universal** - Adjustments help everyone, regardless of itemizing
5. **Donate appreciated assets** - Double benefit: avoid gains + get FMV deduction
6. **QCDs are powerful** - Better than deduction for those 70½+
7. **SE tax is significant** - Entity structure can provide savings
8. **SALT cap requires creativity** - State-specific workarounds may help
