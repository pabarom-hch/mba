---

## Answer Key

### Section 1: Tax Calculation Problems

**Problem 1:**

a) **AGI Calculation:**
```
Wages (Michael):           $285,000
Wages (Sarah):             $165,000
Interest:                    $8,000
Qualified dividends:        $22,000
Short-term capital gain:    $15,000
Long-term capital gain:     $45,000
─────────────────────────────────────
Gross Income:              $540,000

Less Adjustments:
401(k) contributions:      -$46,000
HSA contribution:           -$8,300
─────────────────────────────────────
AGI:                       $485,700
```

b) **Taxable Income:**
```
Standard deduction (MFJ): $29,200

Itemized deductions:
SALT (capped):             $10,000
Mortgage interest:         $24,000
Charitable:                $12,000
Total itemized:            $46,000

Use itemized ($46,000 > $29,200)

Taxable income: $485,700 - $46,000 = $439,700
```

c) **Tax on Ordinary Income:**
```
Ordinary portion:
$439,700 - $22,000 (QD) - $45,000 (LTCG) = $372,700

Tax calculation:
10% on $23,200:            $2,320
12% on $71,100:            $8,532
22% on $106,750:          $23,485
24% on $171,650:          $41,196
Total ordinary tax:        $75,533
```

d) **Tax on Preferential Income + NIIT:**
```
Qualified dividends + LTCG: $67,000
These "stack" on top of ordinary income
$372,700 ordinary → preferential starts here
All $67,000 in 15% LTCG bracket
LTCG tax: $67,000 × 15% = $10,050

NIIT (3.8% on investment income above $250K MAGI):
Investment income: $8,000 + $22,000 + $15,000 + $45,000 = $90,000
MAGI: $485,700
Excess over $250,000: $235,700
Lesser of excess or investment income: $90,000
NIIT: $90,000 × 3.8% = $3,420

Total tax: $75,533 + $10,050 + $3,420 = $89,003
```

---

**Problem 2:**

a) **Loss Opportunities:**
```
AAPL: $40,000 - $32,000 = $8,000 STCL (8 months)
BND: $42,000 - $38,000 = $4,000 LTCL (14 months)
Total harvestable losses: $12,000
```

b) **Tax Savings:**
```
$60,000 LTCG realized
Less $4,000 LTCL offset: $56,000 net LTCG
Tax saved on $4,000 LTCG: $4,000 × 15% = $600

$8,000 STCL offsets ordinary income:
Tax saved: $8,000 × 32% = $2,560

But wait - STCL first offsets net LTCG:
Net: $60,000 - $4,000 - $8,000 = $48,000 LTCG
Tax on $48,000 vs $60,000 at 15%: Saves $1,800 from LTCL offset

Actually, STCL at 32% value → better to have excess to offset income
Recompute: $8,000 STCL + $4,000 LTCL = $12,000 total
Offsets $12,000 of $60,000 LTCG: $12,000 × 15% = $1,800 saved

Net LTCG: $48,000
Tax: $48,000 × 15% = $7,200

Without harvesting: $60,000 × 15% = $9,000
Savings: $1,800
```

c) **Replacement Strategy:**
```
AAPL → Buy QQQ (tech ETF) - different securities
BND → Buy AGG (different bond fund) - same exposure, different fund

Wait 31 days if want to repurchase exact securities
Maintain market exposure during waiting period
```

d) **Excess Losses:**
```
All losses used this year (offset LTCG)
If had excess: Carry forward indefinitely
Could offset $3,000 ordinary income per year
```

---

**Problem 3:**

a) **Conversion Room:**
```
Current income: $0 (retired, SS not claimed, pension $45K)
Standard deduction (MFJ): $29,200
22% bracket ends: $201,050

Available space:
$201,050 - ($45,000 pension - $29,200 standard ded) = $201,050 - $15,800 = $185,250

Can convert up to $185,250 while staying in 22% bracket
```

b) **Tax on 5-Year Conversion:**
```
$100,000/year × 22% = $22,000/year
5 years: $110,000 total tax
```

c) **Comparison to RMDs:**
```
If same $500,000 taken as RMDs at 32%:
$500,000 × 32% = $160,000 total tax

Savings: $160,000 - $110,000 = $50,000
```

d) **Other Factors:**
```
- Medicare IRMAA (conversions increase MAGI)
- State taxes
- Time value of money
- Uncertainty of future rates
- Estate planning (Roth to heirs is tax-free)
```

### Section 2: Short Answer

**Question 1:**
Deduction reduces taxable income; credit reduces tax dollar-for-dollar.

$1,000 deduction at 50%+ rate saves $500+ (more than $500 credit)
Example: Executive in 37% federal + 13.3% CA = 50.3%
$1,000 deduction saves $503 vs. $500 credit

---

**Question 2:**
```
Combined rate: 37% + 8% × (1 - 0.37) = 42.04%
TEY = 3.5% / (1 - 0.4204) = 6.04%

Corporate at 5.2% < TEY 6.04%
Keep municipal bonds (better after-tax return)
```

---

**Question 3:**
Wash sale rule disallows loss if repurchase substantially identical security within 30 days before/after sale.

December 15 to January 10 = 26 days (within 30-day window)
Loss DISALLOWED for current year
But: Loss added to basis of new shares
Recovered when eventually sell

---

**Question 4:**
1. One spouse has large medical expenses (7.5% AGI floor lower on single income)
2. Income-driven student loan repayment (lower income = lower payment)
3. One spouse has liability concerns (limit joint liability)
4. Innocent spouse situations

---

**Question 5:**
```
Regular donation (itemizes):
Donate $15,000, get $15,000 deduction
Tax savings at 24%: $3,600
But: Must include RMD as income first

QCD:
$15,000 directly to charity from IRA
Satisfies RMD, EXCLUDES from income
Tax savings: $15,000 × 24% = $3,600
PLUS: Reduces AGI (better for IRMAA, SS taxation)

QCD is superior - reduces AGI rather than just deduction
```

---

### Section 3: Strategy Analysis

**Question 1: ISO Exercise**

a) **Exercise all, hold for qualifying:**
```
Spread: $50 × 20,000 = $1,000,000
Regular tax at exercise: $0
AMT adjustment: $1,000,000
Likely triggers significant AMT (~$260,000)
If hold 1+ year and 2+ years from grant: LTCG on all gain
Risk: Stock could decline; still owe AMT
```

b) **Exercise all, sell immediately:**
```
Disqualifying disposition
Spread at exercise: $1,000,000 ordinary income
Tax at 24%: $240,000
Plus employment taxes
No AMT (disqualifying = no adjustment)
No stock price risk
```

c) **Exercise 5,000/year:**
```
Spread per year: $50 × 5,000 = $250,000
AMT adjustment: $250,000/year
May stay below AMT threshold
Spreads risk over time
Can adapt if stock price changes
```

**Recommendation:** Exercise 5,000/year (Strategy C)
- Manages AMT exposure
- Reduces concentration risk over time
- Allows adjustment based on stock price
- Tax diversification across years

---

**Question 2: Estate Planning**

a) **Do nothing (portability):**
- At $24M, within combined exemption ($27.22M)
- No current estate tax
- BUT: If exemption drops to $7M, $24M - $14M = $10M taxable
- Estate tax: ~$4M
- Risk: Legislative change

b) **SLATs:**
- Each creates trust using $13.6M exemption
- Assets grow outside estate
- Spouse beneficiary (indirect access)
- Removes appreciation
- Cost: Loss of direct control

c) **Annual exclusion:**
- $36,000 × 9 family members = $324,000/year
- 10 years: $3.24M transferred
- Modest impact but no exemption use
- Add 529 superfunding: $180,000 × 6 grandchildren = $1.08M

d) **Dynasty trust:**
- Fund with $10M
- Allocate GST exemption
- Benefits children, grandchildren, beyond
- Growth outside estate forever

**Recommendation:** Combine strategies
- Create SLATs now using current exemption ($20M total)
- Dynasty trust for grandchildren ($4M)
- Annual exclusion program ongoing
- Preserves wealth against future exemption reduction

---

**Question 3: Distribution Strategy**

| Age | Robert | Linda | SS | Taxable | Roth | Income | Convert |
|-----|--------|-------|-----|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 68 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $50K | $10K | $60K | $100K |
| 69 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $50K | $10K | $60K | $100K |
| 70 | $0 | $0 | $72K | $30K | $0 | $102K | $50K |
| 71 | $50K | $0 | $72K | $0 | $0 | $122K | $30K |
| 72 | $50K | $0 | $72K | $0 | $0 | $122K | $30K |
| 73 | RMD | $0 | $72K | $0 | $0 | RMD+72K | Limited |
| 74 | RMD | RMD | $72K | $0 | $0 | RMDs+72K | Limited |
| 75 | RMD | RMD | $72K | $0 | $0 | RMDs+72K | Limited |

IRMAA: Keep income below $206K to avoid surcharges
RMD reduction: Conversions reduce Traditional balances

### Section 4: Comprehensive Case

**Part A: Compensation Tax Analysis**

1. **Separation Year Income (CA resident):**
```
Severance: $975,000
Pro-rata bonus: $300,000
Accelerated RSUs: $750,000
Option exercise: 50,000 × ($120-$40) = $4,000,000
Consulting: $300,000
Total ordinary: $6,325,000

Federal tax (37%): ~$2,340,250
CA tax (13.3%): ~$841,225
FICA (capped): ~$13,000
Medicare (uncapped): ~$91,713
Additional Medicare: ~$56,925

Total tax: ~$3,343,113
```

2. **Marginal Rate on Options:**
```
Federal: 37%
CA: 13.3%
Medicare: 2.35%
Total: 52.65%
```

---

**Part B: Relocation Analysis**

1. **CA Source Rules:**
- RSUs: CA taxes portion earned while in CA
- Stock options: Allocated based on service period in CA
- NQDC: Complex - may allocate or source to where earned
- Severance: Generally sourced to CA if employment was there
- Consulting: Sourced to where services performed

2. **Relocation Strategy:**
```
Month 1-6: Remain in CA, receive salary
Month 6: RSUs vest ($1.5M) - still CA resident
Month 7: MOVE TO TEXAS, establish domicile
Month 8+:
- Negotiate delayed severance (receive in TX)
- Exercise options from TX (still CA-allocated for service period)
- Start consulting from TX
- Begin NQDC distributions from TX
```

3. **State Tax Savings:**
```
Items taxable regardless (CA allocation):
Options: ~40% allocated to CA = $1.6M × 13.3% = ~$213,000

Savings (TX sourced):
60% options: $2.4M × 13.3% = $319,200 saved
Consulting (from TX): $300K × 13.3% = $39,900 saved
Severance (if delayed): $975K × 13.3% = $129,675 saved
NQDC (from TX): $2.5M × 13.3% = $332,500 saved over 5 years

Total potential savings: ~$821,000
Less aggressive items CA may challenge: ~$500,000 savings realistic
```

---

**Part C: Concentrated Stock**

1. **Concentration:**
```
Total DataFlow: ~$6,750,000
Liquid net worth: ~$10,100,000 (excl. home)
Concentration: 67% - severely concentrated
```

2. **3-Year Diversification Plan:**
```
Year 1:
- Donate $500,000 to DAF (avoids $200K gain tax)
- Sell $750,000 (LTCG ~$300K, tax ~$71K)
- Remaining: $5,500,000 (54%)

Year 2:
- Donate $300,000 to DAF
- Sell $1,000,000 (LTCG ~$400K, tax ~$95K)
- Remaining: $4,200,000 (42%)

Year 3:
- Donate $200,000 to DAF
- Sell $1,000,000 (LTCG ~$400K, tax ~$95K)
- Remaining: $3,000,000 (30%)

Total charitable: $1,000,000 (deductions: ~$370K tax savings)
Total sold: $2,750,000
Target: <30% concentration achieved
```

---

**Part D: Retirement Income**

1. **Distribution Strategy (59-70):**
```
Ages 59-65: Taxable account first
            Keep income low for ACA subsidies
            Roth conversions: $150K/year (fill 24% bracket)

Ages 65-70: Traditional IRA distributions
            Medicare (IRMAA management)
            Continue modest Roth conversions
            Delay Social Security
```

2. **Sustainability Analysis:**
```
Starting assets: ~$10M liquid
Annual need: $200,000
At 5% real return, 3% inflation:
Monte Carlo: 95%+ success rate through age 90

Safety margin: Substantial
Can also access home equity if needed
```

3. **Social Security Strategy:**
```
Victoria: Delay to 70 → $3,200 × 1.24 = $3,968/month
James: Delay to 70 → $2,800 × 1.24 = $3,472/month
Combined at both 70: $7,440/month = $89,280/year

Alternative: James claims at 67, Victoria delays
Provides income while maximizing Victoria's higher benefit
Optimal: Both delay to 70 given assets can bridge
```
