# Retirement Account Taxation

## Learning Objectives

- Navigate taxation of retirement account distributions
- Optimize Roth conversion strategies
- Plan for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)
- Apply Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) strategy
- Coordinate retirement withdrawals with other income

---

## Introduction

Retirement account taxation represents one of the most complex and consequential areas of tax planning. The difference between optimal and suboptimal strategies can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars over a retirement lifetime. Understanding distribution taxation, conversion strategies, and RMD rules is essential for effective retirement planning.

---

## Traditional Account Distributions

### Taxation of Traditional IRA/401(k)

```
BASIC RULE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Contributions: Tax-deductible (pre-tax)
Growth: Tax-deferred
Distributions: 100% ordinary income

No preferential rates
All gains converted to ordinary income
Cannot separate principal from earnings

EARLY WITHDRAWAL PENALTY:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Before age 59½: 10% penalty + ordinary income tax

Exceptions to 10% penalty:
- Age 55 separation from service (401k only)
- Disability
- Death (to beneficiaries)
- SEPP (72t distributions)
- Medical expenses >7.5% AGI
- First home ($10,000 lifetime)
- Higher education expenses
- IRS levy
- Qualified disaster distributions
- Birth/adoption ($5,000)
```

### Distribution Strategies

```
INCOME SMOOTHING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal: Keep taxable income in optimal brackets
      Avoid spikes that push into high brackets

Example:
Retirement income needs: $150,000/year
Social Security: $40,000
Taxable income target: $110,000

Year-by-year planning:
Age 62-66: SS not yet claimed
           Withdraw $150,000 from traditional
           Taxable income: $150,000

Age 67+: SS begins $40,000
         Reduce traditional to $110,000
         Taxable income: $110,000 + 85% of SS

TAX BRACKET FILLING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Withdraw to fill current bracket, not exceed
Remaining needs from taxable or Roth

Example (MFJ):
12% bracket ends at $94,300
Have $50,000 other income
Withdraw $44,300 from traditional (fills 12%)
Additional needs from Roth (tax-free)
```

---

## Roth Account Distributions

### Tax-Free Distributions

```
QUALIFIED DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. 5-Year Rule Met:
   5 taxable years since first Roth contribution

2. Triggering Event:
   - Age 59½
   - Death
   - Disability
   - First home ($10,000 lifetime)

If both met: 100% tax-free distribution

NON-QUALIFIED DISTRIBUTIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ordering rules apply:
1. Regular contributions (always tax/penalty free)
2. Conversion contributions (5-year rule each)
3. Earnings (taxable + possible penalty)

Example:
Total Roth: $100,000
- Contributions: $50,000
- Conversions: $30,000 (2021, 5 years not met)
- Earnings: $20,000

Age 57, withdraw $60,000:
- First $50,000 from contributions: Tax-free
- Next $10,000 from conversions: Tax-free, but 10% penalty
  (conversion < 5 years old AND under 59½)
```

### Roth Distribution Strategy

```
OPTIMAL ROTH USAGE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Last in sequence (preserve tax-free growth)
2. When in high tax bracket (max benefit)
3. For large one-time needs (avoid bracket spike)
4. For legacy (tax-free to heirs)
5. To manage Medicare IRMAA

WHEN TO USE ROTH FIRST:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Facing ACA premium cliff
- Managing Social Security taxation
- IRMAA bracket considerations
- Expecting higher future rates
- Large traditional balance creating RMD pressure
```

---

## Roth Conversion Strategies

### Conversion Mechanics

```
HOW CONVERSIONS WORK:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Transfer from Traditional IRA to Roth IRA
Conversion amount = taxable income (current year)
Pay tax now at current rates
Future growth tax-free

CANNOT CONVERT:
- RMD amounts (must take RMD first, then convert)
- Non-deductible contributions counted separately

TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No income limits (unlike Roth contributions)
Any amount can be converted
Tax due with return (or estimated payments)
Can convert partial amounts
```

### Conversion Analysis

```
WHEN CONVERSION MAKES SENSE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✓ Current tax rate < expected future rate
✓ Large traditional balance → future RMD pressure
✓ Long time horizon (more tax-free growth)
✓ Have funds outside IRA to pay tax
✓ Currently in low-income year
✓ Want to reduce future IRMAA
✓ Estate planning (tax-free to heirs)

WHEN TO AVOID CONVERSION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✗ Current rate > expected future rate
✗ Must use IRA funds to pay tax
✗ Short time horizon
✗ Conversion pushes into high bracket
✗ Would trigger ACA cliff or other phase-outs

BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
If same tax rate now and future: Neutral
If pay tax from IRA: Need lower future rate to break even
Rule of thumb: Convert if current rate ≤ 0.75 × future rate
```

### Conversion Strategies

```
STRATEGY 1: BRACKET FILLING
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Convert up to top of current bracket each year

Example (MFJ):
Other income: $100,000
22% bracket ends: $201,050
Taxable income: $100,000 - $29,200 std ded = $70,800
Space in 22% bracket: $201,050 - $70,800 = $130,250

Convert: $130,250
Tax: $130,250 × 22% = $28,655
Result: Fill 22% bracket without entering 24%

STRATEGY 2: RETIREMENT GAP CONVERSIONS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Between retirement and RMDs/Social Security
Often lowest-income years
Convert aggressively

Timeline:
Age 55-62: Work part-time or not at all
           Very low income
           Convert at 12-22% rate

Age 63-72: Social Security may begin
           Still before RMDs
           Moderate conversion opportunity

Age 73+: RMDs begin
         Less conversion room
         Must take RMD before converting

STRATEGY 3: IRMAA MANAGEMENT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Medicare IRMAA uses 2-year lookback
High income = higher premiums

Convert BEFORE age 63 (affects age 65 premiums)
Or plan carefully around IRMAA brackets
May be worth paying higher bracket to reduce RMDs
```

### Conversion Example

```
PROFILE: The Hendersons
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ages: 62 and 60
Just retired
Traditional IRA: $2,000,000
Roth IRA: $200,000
Taxable: $500,000
Annual spending: $120,000

BEFORE RMDs: 10 Years of Opportunity
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Strategy: Convert $150,000/year for 10 years

Year 1-10 Income:
Spending from taxable/Roth: ~$120,000/year
Conversion amount: $150,000/year
Taxable income: ~$150,000

Tax on conversions (22-24%): ~$35,000/year
Total conversion: $1,500,000
Total tax paid: ~$350,000

After 10 years:
Traditional: $500,000 + growth ≈ $700,000
Roth: $200,000 + $1,500,000 + growth ≈ $2,800,000

WITHOUT CONVERSION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Traditional at age 72: $2,000,000 + growth ≈ $4,000,000
RMD at 73: ~$150,000/year (forced)
Plus Social Security: $60,000
Taxable income: $210,000
Tax rate: 24-32%

COMPARISON:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
With conversion:
- Paid $350,000 in taxes at 22-24%
- Future withdrawals mostly tax-free
- Smaller RMDs on $700,000

Without conversion:
- No upfront tax
- RMDs of $150,000+ at 24-32%
- Over 20 years: $600,000+ in RMD taxes

Net advantage of conversion: $200,000-$300,000
Plus: Estate tax benefits (tax-free to heirs)
```

## Required Minimum Distributions

### RMD Rules

```
WHEN RMDs BEGIN:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Traditional IRA: April 1 following year turn 73
                 (Increases to 75 in 2033)
Roth IRA: No RMDs for original owner
401(k)/403(b): Same as IRA, unless still working
               (5% owner exception doesn't apply)
Inherited IRAs: See beneficiary rules

RMD CALCULATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RMD = December 31 prior year balance ÷ Life expectancy factor

2024 Uniform Lifetime Table (sample):
Age    Factor    Approximate %
73     26.5      3.77%
75     24.6      4.07%
80     20.2      4.95%
85     16.0      6.25%
90     12.2      8.20%

Example:
IRA balance 12/31/2023: $1,000,000
Age in 2024: 75
Factor: 24.6
RMD: $1,000,000 ÷ 24.6 = $40,650
```

### RMD Strategies

```
TIMING:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Can delay first RMD to April 1 of following year
BUT: Two RMDs in second year (April + December)

Decision:
If income higher in year 1: Delay
If income higher in year 2: Take in year 1
Usually: Take in year 1 to avoid bunching

AGGREGATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Multiple IRAs: Calculate separately, withdraw from any
Multiple 401(k)s: Calculate and withdraw separately

Strategy: Take RMD from account with:
- Highest cost basis (if NUA applies)
- Desired rebalancing
- Best investment options remain

QUALIFIED CHARITABLE DISTRIBUTIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Age 70½+: Can give up to $105,000 (2024) directly to charity
Satisfies RMD requirement
Excludes from income (better than deduction)
Reduces AGI-based calculations

Example:
RMD: $50,000
Charitable intent: $20,000
Standard approach:
- Take $50,000 RMD (taxable)
- Donate $20,000 (deduction if itemize)
- Net taxable: $30,000 or $50,000 (if standard ded)

QCD approach:
- QCD $20,000 directly to charity
- Take $30,000 RMD
- Taxable: $30,000
- Savings: $20,000 excluded from income entirely
```

### RMD Penalty Avoidance

```
PENALTY FOR FAILURE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
25% of amount not taken (reduced from 50% in 2023)
10% if corrected within 2 years

COMMON MISTAKES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Missing first RMD deadline (April 1)
2. Forgetting inherited IRA RMDs
3. Not aggregating correctly
4. Thinking Roth 401(k) has no RMD (roll to Roth IRA)
5. Missing the 10-year rule for inherited IRAs

AUTOMATIC RMDs:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Set up automatic distributions with custodian
Calculate early each year
Document and calendar deadlines
```

---

## Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)

### NUA Strategy

```
WHAT IS NUA:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Special treatment for employer stock in 401(k)
Instead of rolling to IRA, distribute to taxable account

TAX TREATMENT:
- Cost basis: Ordinary income when distributed
- Appreciation (NUA): Long-term capital gain when sold
  (Regardless of holding period)

REQUIREMENTS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Employer securities (stock)
2. Distributed in lump-sum distribution
3. Triggering event: separation, age 59½, death, disability

EXAMPLE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
401(k) has $500,000 company stock
Cost basis: $100,000
NUA: $400,000

Option A: Roll to IRA
Future distribution: 100% ordinary income
At 37% rate: $500,000 × 37% = $185,000 tax

Option B: NUA Distribution
Year of distribution:
- $100,000 (basis) taxed as ordinary income
- Tax: $100,000 × 37% = $37,000

When sell stock:
- $400,000 (NUA) taxed as LTCG
- Tax: $400,000 × 23.8% = $95,200

Total tax: $37,000 + $95,200 = $132,200

Savings: $185,000 - $132,200 = $52,800
```

### NUA Decision Factors

```
NUA MAKES SENSE WHEN:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✓ Large NUA relative to basis (low basis)
✓ High ordinary income tax rate
✓ Plan to sell stock soon (lock in LTCG rate)
✓ Need diversification anyway
✓ Younger age (more time for stepped-up basis if hold)

NUA MAY NOT MAKE SENSE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✗ Small NUA (not worth complexity)
✗ Low ordinary rate (little differential)
✗ Want to keep tax-deferred
✗ Will trigger 10% penalty on basis
✗ High state tax on NUA (some states tax as ordinary)

HYBRID STRATEGY:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Take enough stock for NUA treatment
Roll remainder to IRA
Distribute only if NUA large enough
Keep some in IRA for continued deferral
```

---

## Distribution Coordination

### Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Order

```
GENERAL SEQUENCE:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. RMDs (required, must take)
2. Taxable accounts (preferential rates on gains)
3. Traditional IRA/401(k) (ordinary rates)
4. Roth accounts (tax-free, preserve for later/legacy)

BUT ADJUST FOR:
- Bracket filling (take more traditional if in low bracket)
- Roth conversions (may take Roth contribution to pay tax)
- IRMAA management (may use Roth to avoid income spike)
- ACA subsidies (manage MAGI with Roth)
- Capital gains rates (may realize gains at 0%)
```

### Comprehensive Withdrawal Example

```
PROFILE: The Nguyens (Age 70)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Traditional IRA: $1,200,000
Roth IRA: $300,000
Taxable: $400,000 (basis $250,000)
Social Security: $48,000/year
Spending need: $120,000/year

YEAR 1 (Before RMDs):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Income sources:
Social Security: $48,000 (85% taxable = $40,800)

Gap to $120,000: $72,000

Strategy:
Take $60,000 from traditional IRA
Take $12,000 from taxable (LTCG)

Taxable income:
SS (85%): $40,800
IRA: $60,000
LTCG: $12,000 - $7,500 basis = $4,500
Total: $105,300

Tax:
Ordinary: ~$8,000 (22% bracket)
LTCG: $4,500 × 15% = $675
Total: ~$8,675

Roth conversion opportunity:
22% bracket ends: $201,050
Space: $201,050 - $100,800 = $100,250
Consider: Convert $100,000 at 22%
Tax on conversion: $22,000

YEAR 4 (RMDs Begin at 73):
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IRA balance: ~$1,000,000 (after conversions)
RMD: ~$38,000
Plus SS: $48,000 (85% = $40,800)

Taxable before spending: $78,800
Spend from: Taxable or Roth for remainder
Less conversion opportunity (bracket filling)
```

## State Tax Considerations

### State Treatment of Retirement Income

```
NO TAX ON RETIREMENT INCOME:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No income tax: AK, FL, NV, NH*, SD, TN*, TX, WA, WY
               (*limited income tax)

Exempt all retirement income:
IL, MS, PA (own contributions only)

PARTIAL EXEMPTIONS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Many states exempt:
- Social Security (fully or partially)
- Pension income (up to limit)
- IRA/401(k) up to certain amount

Examples:
GA: Exempt $65,000 if 65+ ($130,000 MFJ)
MI: Private pensions partially exempt
NY: First $20,000 public pensions exempt

FULL TAXATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CA, CT, MN, VT: Tax all retirement income
May have high rates (CA 13.3%)

RELOCATION STRATEGY:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Move before distributions/conversions
Establish domicile thoroughly
Can save 5-13% in state tax
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Traditional distributions = ordinary income** - No preferential rates
2. **Roth distributions tax-free** - If qualified (5 years + 59½)
3. **Roth conversions in low-income years** - Fill brackets strategically
4. **RMDs required at 73** - Plan for forced distributions
5. **QCDs superior to deductions** - For those 70½+ with charitable intent
6. **NUA can save significantly** - For highly appreciated employer stock
7. **Coordinate with Social Security** - Avoid taxation stacking
8. **State taxes vary widely** - Consider residency planning

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: RMD Calculation
IRA balance 12/31: $800,000. Age 76. Calculate RMD using uniform lifetime table factor of 23.7.

### Problem 2: Roth Conversion
MFJ, $80,000 taxable income, 22% bracket ends at $201,050. Standard deduction $29,200. How much can convert staying in 22%?

### Problem 3: NUA Analysis
401(k) with $300,000 company stock (basis $50,000). Compare NUA distribution vs. IRA rollover. Assume 32% ordinary, 18.8% LTCG.
