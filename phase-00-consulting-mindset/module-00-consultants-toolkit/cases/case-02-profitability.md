## Background

Franklin Manufacturing is a 75-year-old manufacturer of precision industrial components, primarily serving the automotive, aerospace, and heavy machinery industries. The company operates 6 manufacturing plants across the US Midwest.

Three years ago, Franklin was a healthy business with 12% EBITDA margins. Today, margins have declined to 5% despite stable revenue. The Board is concerned and has brought in consultants to diagnose the problem and recommend solutions.

## The Situation

**Historical Performance:**

| Metric | 3 Years Ago | Today | Change |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Revenue | $780M | $800M | +3% |
| EBITDA | $94M | $40M | -57% |
| EBITDA Margin | 12.0% | 5.0% | -7 pts |
| Employees | 3,200 | 3,800 | +19% |
| Plants | 6 | 6 | - |

**CEO's Perspective:**
"I don't understand it. Our revenue is stable, we haven't lost any major customers, and we've invested in modernizing our operations. Yet our profitability has collapsed. The Board is asking hard questions and I need answers."

**The Question:**
Why has profitability declined, and what should Franklin do about it?

## Discussion Questions

Apply Module 0 frameworks to analyze this case.

### Question 1: Structure the Problem
Build an issue tree to diagnose why profitability has declined. Ensure each level is MECE.

### Question 2: Prioritize Using 80/20
Based on the data, which factors are driving the majority of the profit decline? Where should Franklin focus?

### Question 3: Root Cause Analysis
Using hypothesis-driven thinking, what is the root cause of Franklin's problems? (Hint: Look for patterns that connect multiple symptoms.)

### Question 4: Synthesize
Develop a governing thought that captures the core issue. Write a SCQA that frames the situation.

### Question 5: Recommend
What should Franklin do? Prioritize actions and structure your recommendation using the Pyramid Principle.

## Consulting Approach

### Issue Tree: Profitability Diagnosis

```
Why has EBITDA margin declined from 12% to 5%?
│
├── Revenue-Side Factors
│   ├── Price changes
│   │   ├── Did we lower prices?
│   │   └── Did we fail to raise prices with costs?
│   │
│   └── Mix changes
│       ├── Shift between segments (Auto vs. Aero vs. Machinery)?
│       └── Shift within segments (product complexity)?
│
└── Cost-Side Factors
    ├── Raw materials
    │   ├── Commodity price increases?
    │   ├── Supplier pricing power?
    │   └── Waste/rework costs?
    │
    ├── Labor
    │   ├── Headcount increases?
    │   ├── Productivity decline?
    │   └── Overtime premium?

    └── Manufacturing overhead
        ├── Fixed cost leverage (utilization)?
        ├── Complexity costs?
        └── Quality-related costs?
```

### Quantifying the Profit Bridge

Starting EBITDA: $94M (12% margin)
Ending EBITDA: $40M (5% margin)
**Gap to explain: $54M**

| Factor | Impact | Calculation |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Segment mix shift | -$15M | Lost high-margin Auto, gained lower-margin mix |
| Price erosion | -$12M | Prices down more than costs could absorb |
| Labor productivity | -$18M | 19% more headcount for 3% more revenue |
| Raw material costs | -$10M | Commodity + supplier + rework |
| Complexity costs | -$8M | SKU proliferation, setup time, quality |
| Other | +$9M | SG&A savings, other |
| **Total** | **-$54M** | |

### The 80/20: What Really Matters

**~80% of profit decline driven by:**
1. Labor productivity (-$18M) — 33%
2. Segment/product mix (-$15M) — 28%
3. Price erosion (-$12M) — 22%

**The pattern:** These aren't independent. They share a root cause.

### Root Cause Synthesis

**The Governing Thought:**

"Franklin's profit collapse is self-inflicted: in trying to be everything to everyone, we've become efficient at nothing. SKU proliferation has destroyed labor productivity, product complexity has eroded margins, and our pursuit of aerospace growth came at the cost of our core automotive business."

**The Causal Chain:**
```
SKU Proliferation (68% increase)
        ↓
Higher setup times, lower productivity
        ↓
Quality problems, overtime, missed deliveries
        ↓
Price pressure from unhappy customers
        ↓
Margin collapse
```

## Teaching Note

### Key Insights Students Should Surface

1. **This is a complexity problem, not a market problem**
   - Revenue is stable
   - The company added complexity without adding capacity/capability
   - SKU proliferation is the root cause

2. **The symptoms are interconnected**
   - Low productivity → quality problems → overtime → higher costs
   - Late deliveries → unhappy customers → price pressure
   - Complexity → setup time → lower utilization

3. **The "growth" was actually value-destroying**
   - Aerospace growth looked good on revenue line
   - But it came with complexity and lower margins
   - And it distracted from defending more profitable automotive

4. **Labor productivity is the financial symptom**
   - 19% more people for 3% more revenue
   - But adding people was rational given complexity
   - You can't fix labor without fixing complexity

### Recommended Answer

**SCQA:**

**Situation:** "Franklin has been a profitable manufacturer for 75 years, with consistent 12% margins and strong customer relationships."

**Complication:** "Over the past three years, we've added 68% more SKUs and pursued aerospace growth. While revenue stayed stable, margins collapsed to 5%. We now have 3,800 employees doing the work that 3,200 used to do, quality has deteriorated, and our best customers are frustrated."

**Question:** "How do we restore profitability while preserving customer relationships?"

**Answer:** "Simplify. We need to rationalize our SKU portfolio, focus on segments where we can win profitably, and rebuild operational excellence."

**Recommendation Structure:**
```
Restore profitability through simplification and focus
│
├── Rationalize SKU portfolio (Target: $25M profit improvement)
│   ├── Eliminate bottom 1,000 SKUs (<$100K revenue each)
│   ├── Consolidate similar SKUs (reduce variants)
│   ├── Implement pricing gates for high-complexity orders
│
├── Restore operational excellence (Target: $15M profit improvement)
│   ├── Reduce overtime from 22% to 10%
│   ├── Improve first-pass yield from 87% to 92%
│   ├── Right-size labor to new complexity level
│
├── Refocus segment strategy (Target: $10M profit improvement)
│   ├── Defend core automotive accounts (pricing discipline)
│   ├── Selective aerospace growth (only profitable complexity)
│   ├── Exit unprofitable heavy machinery accounts
│
└── Implementation
    ├── Quick wins (0-6 months): SKU elimination, pricing
    ├── Medium term (6-18 months): Operational improvements
    ├── Ongoing: Complexity governance process
```

**Expected Results:**
- EBITDA improvement: $40M → $90M (from 5% to 11%)
- Timeline: 18-24 months
- Investment required: $5M (consulting, severance, systems)
