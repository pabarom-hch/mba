## Consulting Approach

### How a Consultant Would Structure This

**Issue Tree:**
```
Should NovaTech enter the European market?
│
├── 1. Is the market attractive?
│   ├── Size: Is it large enough?
│   ├── Growth: Is it growing?
│   └── Profitability: Can we make money?
│
├── 2. Can we win?
│   ├── Product: Does our product fit?
│   ├── Capabilities: Can we execute?
│   └── Competition: Can we differentiate?
│
├── 3. Is it worth it?
│   ├── Financial returns: Does it beat hurdle rate?
│   ├── Strategic value: Does it advance our strategy?
│   └── Opportunity cost: What are we giving up?
│
└── 4. How should we enter?
    ├── Timing: When?
    ├── Mode: Organic vs. acquisition vs. partnership?
    └── Sequencing: Which markets first?
```

### Hypothesis-Driven Analysis

**Day-One Hypothesis:**
"NovaTech should enter Europe with a moderate investment, starting with Netherlands/Nordics as beachheads, before expanding to Germany and UK."

**Why:**
- Market is attractive (growing, fragmented)
- Product advantage is real (per customer research)
- Full investment is risky given competitor head start
- Smaller markets offer easier entry before UK/Germany dogfight

### 80/20 Analysis

**Key Questions (that drive 80% of the decision):**
1. Can we achieve product readiness fast enough?
2. Will the financial returns exceed our hurdle rate?
3. What's the true opportunity cost in the US?

## Teaching Note

### Key Insights Students Should Surface

1. **Market is attractive but not a slam dunk**
   - Good size and growth
   - But competition is intensifying (Datavant just entered)
   - Fragmented market is double-edged: opportunity but also many players

2. **NovaTech has a real product advantage**
   - 65% of prospects say "better product"
   - But support/localization gap is real
   - Product advantage erodes without local investment

3. **The real question is timing and mode**
   - "Should we enter?" is almost certainly yes
   - "How and when?" is the strategic question

4. **Opportunity cost is significant**
   - US is still growing
   - Europe investment comes at US expense
   - Need to size this properly

### Recommended Answer

**Recommendation:** Enter Europe with moderate investment ($8-10M) over 18 months, starting with Netherlands/Nordics as beachhead.

**Structure:**
```
Enter Europe with focused, moderate approach
│
├── Europe is attractive and strategic
│   ├── $1.8B addressable market growing 18%
│   ├── Customer pull is real (existing customers asking)
│   ├── First-mover advantage available in secondary markets
│
├── Start with Netherlands/Nordics, not UK/Germany
│   ├── Lower competition (easier wins for references)
│   ├── High English proficiency (less localization)
│   ├── Faster path to proof points
│
└── Moderate investment preserves optionality
    ├── Proves model before large commitment
    ├── Manages opportunity cost in US
    └── Allows adjustment based on results
```

**NOT Recommended:**
- Aggressive entry ($15M): Too risky, US opportunity cost too high
- Conservative entry ($4M): Won't achieve minimum viable presence
- Full UK/Germany focus: Too competitive, too much localization
