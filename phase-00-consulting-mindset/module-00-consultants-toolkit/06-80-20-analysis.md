## Introduction

The Pareto Principle—commonly called the 80/20 rule—states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. In business: 80% of revenue often comes from 20% of customers. 80% of problems come from 20% of root causes. 80% of value comes from 20% of activities.

This is the consultant's secret weapon for prioritization. Instead of analyzing everything equally, focus on the vital few that drive the majority of outcomes.

## Core Concepts

### The Pareto Principle

Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto observed in 1896 that 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population. This pattern—unequal distribution with a small minority driving a large majority—appears everywhere:

**Business Examples:**
- 80% of revenue from 20% of customers
- 80% of complaints from 20% of product defects
- 80% of sales from 20% of products
- 80% of impact from 20% of your time
- 80% of profits from 20% of activities

**The ratio isn't always 80/20.** It might be 90/10 or 70/30. The principle is that **distributions are unequal**, and a small portion drives a disproportionate share of outcomes.

### Why 80/20 Matters

**1. Time is Limited**
You can't analyze everything deeply. 80/20 tells you where to focus.

**2. Resources are Constrained**
Investment should concentrate on highest-impact areas.

**3. Cognitive Load**
Humans can only hold 5-7 things in working memory. Focus on what matters.

**4. Diminishing Returns**
After the vital few, additional effort yields progressively less value.

### Identifying the 80/20

**Step 1: List All Items**
Start with a complete list of customers, products, activities, causes, etc.

**Step 2: Quantify the Outcome**
Measure the outcome you care about (revenue, problems, time, etc.)

**Step 3: Sort by Impact**
Rank items from highest to lowest contribution.

**Step 4: Calculate Cumulative Percentage**
Add up contributions from the top down.

**Step 5: Find the Inflection Point**
Where does the cumulative curve flatten? That's your 80/20 cutoff.

**Example: Customer Revenue Analysis**

| Customer | Revenue | % of Total | Cumulative % |
|----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Acme Corp | $5M | 25% | 25% |
| BigCo | $4M | 20% | 45% |
| TechGiant | $3M | 15% | 60% |
| MegaInc | $2M | 10% | 70% |
| FastGrow | $1.5M | 7.5% | 77.5% |
| ... (15 more customers) | $4.5M | 22.5% | 100% |

**Finding:** Top 5 customers (25% of base) = 77.5% of revenue.
**Implication:** These 5 customers deserve disproportionate attention.

```

### Applications of 80/20

#### 1. Customer Analysis
**Question:** Which customers drive our business?
**Application:** Identify top customers for retention focus, growth investment, and service prioritization.

```
80/20 Customer Matrix:

             │    Low Growth    │    High Growth   │
─────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
High Value   │ Protect fiercely │ Invest heavily   │
(Top 20%)    │ (retention focus)│ (growth focus)   │
─────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
Low Value    │ Serve efficiently│ Develop selectively│
(Bottom 80%) │ (automate)       │ (high-potential) │
```

#### 2. Problem Diagnosis
**Question:** What's really causing this issue?
**Application:** Focus on the few root causes that drive most problems.

**Example: Customer Complaints**
- Shipping delays: 45% of complaints
- Product defects: 25% of complaints
- Billing errors: 15% of complaints
- 15 other issues: 15% of complaints

**80/20 insight:** Fix shipping delays and product defects = solve 70% of complaints.

#### 3. Product Portfolio
**Question:** Which products should we invest in?
**Application:** Identify SKU rationalization opportunities and investment priorities.

**Common Finding:** 20% of SKUs = 80% of revenue (and often 120%+ of profit, since the long tail is unprofitable).

#### 4. Time Management
**Question:** What should I spend my time on?
**Application:** Identify high-leverage activities.

```
CEO Time Audit:
Activity                    │ Time  │ Impact
────────────────────────────┼───────┼────────
Strategic planning          │  10%  │  35%
Key customer relationships  │  15%  │  30%
Talent decisions            │   5%  │  20%
────────────────────────────┼───────┼────────
Subtotal (3 activities)     │  30%  │  85%
────────────────────────────┼───────┼────────
All other activities        │  70%  │  15%
```

**80/20 insight:** 30% of time drives 85% of impact. Protect these activities.

### 80/20 in Analysis

**Don't Boil the Ocean**

When analyzing a problem, use 80/20 to focus:

**Without 80/20:**
- Analyze all 500 customers equally
- Investigate all 50 potential root causes
- Review all 10 years of data

**With 80/20:**
- Deep-dive on top 50 customers (80% of revenue)
- Investigate top 5 root causes (80% of impact)
- Focus on last 3 years (most relevant)

**The Quick Win Matrix**

When identifying actions, prioritize by effort vs. impact:

```
                     IMPACT
                  Low    High
             ┌─────────┬─────────┐
        Low  │   (4)   │   (1)   │
  EFFORT     │  Ignore │Quick Wins│
             ├─────────┼─────────┤
        High │   (3)   │   (2)   │
             │  Avoid  │ Major   │
             │         │ Projects│
             └─────────┴─────────┘

Priority Order: 1 → 2 → (skip 3 & 4 if possible)
```

## Consulting Application

### How McKinsey Uses 80/20

**Project Kickoff:**
- Day 1: What's the 80/20 of this problem?
- Identify the few factors that drive most of the outcome
- Structure workplan around these factors

**Data Gathering:**
- Don't interview everyone—interview the 20% who know 80%
- Don't analyze all data—analyze the data that answers the key questions
- Don't model every scenario—model the ones that matter

**Recommendations:**
- Don't give 15 recommendations—give the 3 that will drive 80% of improvement
- Focus implementation on highest-impact, fastest-to-achieve initiatives

### The "So What" of 80/20 Analysis

Raw analysis: "Top 5 customers represent 80% of revenue."

**Weak So What:** "We have customer concentration."

**Strong So What:** "We should:
1. Create dedicated account teams for these 5 customers
2. Develop custom retention programs
3. Increase executive engagement (CEO to CEO)
4. Conduct quarterly business reviews
5. Build redundancy in key account relationships"

80/20 analysis without action is trivia. The power is in the implications.

### Presenting 80/20 Insights

**Visual Best Practices:**

1. **Pareto Chart** - Bar chart sorted by size with cumulative line
2. **Concentration Curve** - Shows cumulative distribution
3. **Highlight the Cutoff** - Draw line at the 80/20 point
4. **Call Out the Implication** - Slide title = "so what"

**Example Slide Title:**
"Five customers drive 80% of revenue—requiring dedicated account management and retention programs"

NOT: "Customer Revenue Analysis"

## CEO Application

### Strategic Prioritization

CEOs face infinite demands. 80/20 is essential for focus.

**Apply 80/20 to:**

1. **Strategic Initiatives**
   - What 20% of initiatives will drive 80% of strategy execution?
   - Kill or defer the rest.

2. **Your Calendar**
   - What 20% of your time creates 80% of your value?
   - Protect that time ruthlessly.

3. **Organizational Attention**
   - What 20% of goals should the organization obsess over?
   - Everything else is noise.

4. **Board Meetings**
   - What 20% of topics merit 80% of board time?
   - Spend time on what matters.

### Decision Making

When facing complex decisions, apply 80/20 to analysis:

**Before 80/20:**
"We need to analyze the market comprehensively before deciding."
→ 6-month analysis, analysis paralysis

**After 80/20:**
"What are the 3-4 factors that will drive 80% of this decision's success or failure?"
→ 3-week focused analysis, decision made

### Resource Allocation

Apply 80/20 to budgets and people:

**Sales Team:**
- Which 20% of territories drive 80% of revenue?
- Are your best salespeople assigned there?

**R&D Budget:**
- Which 20% of projects will drive 80% of future value?
- Are they funded accordingly?

**Management Attention:**
- Which 20% of business units need 80% of leadership focus?
- Are leaders spending time proportionally?

## Worked Example

### Situation
A manufacturing company has 200 SKUs and is struggling with inventory costs. Management suspects they have too many products but doesn't know where to cut.

### Step 1: Gather Data

| SKU Group | # SKUs | Revenue | Gross Margin $ | Inventory Cost |
|-----------|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Top 10 | 10 (5%) | $45M (60%) | $18M (72%) | $2M (15%) |
| Next 30 | 30 (15%) | $20M (27%) | $5.5M (22%) | $3M (23%) |
| Bottom 160 | 160 (80%) | $10M (13%) | $1.5M (6%) | $8M (62%) |

### Step 2: Identify the 80/20

**Findings:**
- 5% of SKUs (top 10) drive 60% of revenue and 72% of gross margin
- 80% of SKUs (bottom 160) drive only 13% of revenue and 6% of margin
- Bottom 160 SKUs consume 62% of inventory cost

### Step 3: Calculate Impact

If we eliminated the bottom 100 SKUs (50% of catalog, ~5% of revenue):
- Inventory cost savings: ~$4M annually
- Revenue loss: ~$4M
- Margin loss: ~$0.5M
- Net benefit: $3.5M (inventory savings - margin loss)

### Step 4: Develop Recommendation

**Recommendation:** Rationalize SKU portfolio in three phases

Phase 1: Eliminate bottom 50 SKUs (clear losers)
- Revenue impact: <2%
- Inventory savings: $2M
- Timeline: Q1

Phase 2: Review next 50 SKUs for consolidation
- Combine variants, eliminate slow movers
- Target: eliminate 30 additional SKUs
- Timeline: Q2

Phase 3: Implement ongoing 80/20 review process
- Quarterly SKU performance review
- Clear criteria for addition/elimination
- Timeline: Ongoing

**80/20 Insight:** We can eliminate 40% of SKUs while losing only ~5% of revenue and significantly improving working capital.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Analysis Without Action
**Mistake:** "We found the 80/20, interesting fact."
**Fix:** Every 80/20 insight must lead to a "so what" and "now what."

### 2. One-Time Exercise
**Mistake:** Running 80/20 once and forgetting it.
**Fix:** 80/20 distributions shift. Revisit quarterly or annually.

### 3. Ignoring the 80%
**Mistake:** Assuming the bottom 80% doesn't matter at all.
**Fix:** The long tail may contain future growth, niche value, or strategic positioning. Evaluate before cutting.

### 4. False Precision
**Mistake:** Spending weeks getting the exact 80/20.
**Fix:** Directional accuracy is enough. 75/25 or 85/15 still tells you where to focus.

### 5. Wrong Metric
**Mistake:** 80/20 on revenue when margin is the real issue.
**Fix:** Choose the metric that matters most for the decision.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Distributions are unequal** - A minority drives the majority of outcomes
2. **Focus on the vital few** - 20% of inputs drive 80% of outputs
3. **Apply to prioritization** - Time, resources, analysis, initiatives
4. **Don't boil the ocean** - Use 80/20 to scope analysis
5. **Insight requires action** - 80/20 finding → so what → now what
6. **Revisit regularly** - Distributions shift over time
7. **Consider the long tail** - The 80% isn't worthless, just lower priority

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Customer Analysis
You have 100 customers. The top 10 generate 70% of revenue. The bottom 60 generate 5% of revenue and consume 40% of your customer service team's time.

What would you recommend? Structure your answer using the Pyramid Principle.

### Problem 2: Time Audit
Track your time for a week. Categorize activities and estimate impact. Where is your personal 80/20? What should you do differently?

### Problem 3: Root Cause Prioritization
A software company has the following bug categories by customer complaint volume:

- Login issues: 35%
- Slow performance: 25%
- Data sync errors: 20%
- UI glitches: 10%
- Other (15 categories): 10%

Apply 80/20 thinking. What would you recommend the engineering team focus on?
