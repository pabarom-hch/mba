## Section C: Hypothesis-Driven Thinking (15 points)

### Question 13 (8 points)
A SaaS company's customer acquisition cost (CAC) has increased 50% over 12 months despite stable marketing spend.

a) Form three competing hypotheses for why this might be happening.
b) For each hypothesis, describe what evidence would confirm or disconfirm it.

### Question 14 (7 points)
You're a consultant starting an engagement Monday. The client is a grocery chain whose same-store sales have declined 8% over 6 months. You have a 30-minute kickoff call with the CFO tomorrow.

Write your "day one hypothesis" including:
- Core hypothesis (your best guess at the answer)
- Key uncertainties you need to resolve
- Three questions you'll ask in the kickoff call

---

## Section D: Pyramid Principle (15 points)

### Question 15 (8 points)
Restructure the following communication using the Pyramid Principle:

"Hi team, I wanted to share some findings from our customer research project. We interviewed 45 customers over the past month. The interviews took about 30 minutes each. We found that 60% of customers said pricing was a concern. Also, 45% mentioned that onboarding was confusing. Another finding was that customer support response times were mentioned by 35% of respondents. Our NPS is currently 32, which is below the industry average of 45. We also noticed that churn is higher among customers in their first 90 days. Based on all this, I think we should probably focus on improving onboarding and maybe look at our pricing structure. Thoughts?"

### Question 16 (7 points)
Convert these topic-based slide titles to assertion-based headlines:

1. "Q3 Revenue Update"
2. "Competitive Landscape"
3. "Customer Satisfaction Survey Results"
4. "Digital Transformation Initiative"
5. "Recommended Next Steps"

---

## Section E: Synthesis (15 points)

### Question 17 (8 points)
You have the following findings from a consulting engagement. Synthesize these into a governing thought and brief narrative (3-4 sentences).

**Findings:**
- The company's core product has 45% market share (leading position)
- New product launches have a 20% success rate (vs. 40% industry average)
- R&D headcount has grown 50%, but R&D productivity (measured by successful products per engineer) has declined 40%
- Average time-to-market for new products has increased from 18 months to 30 months
- The company's market is growing at 2% annually (mature)
- Two new entrants have launched products that captured 12% market share in 3 years
- Customer research shows 70% want "innovation" from their providers

### Question 18 (7 points)
Push the following finding up the "so what" ladder from finding to action:

**Finding:** "Our top 10 customers (8% of customer base) generate 65% of revenue."

Write out each level: Finding → Observation → Insight → Implication → Action

Write out exactly what you would say.

### Question 20 (5 points)
The CEO asks: "Your recommendation failed. We invested $10M based on your analysis and it hasn't worked. What happened?"

Results are 60% below projection after 9 months.

## Answer Key

### Section A: Knowledge Check

**Q1:** Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. Important because it ensures analysis is complete (nothing missed) and clear (no overlaps/double-counting).

**Q2:** Issue trees break down questions/problems into components. Logic trees build up arguments/recommendations from evidence.

**Q3:** Situation (stable background), Complication (what changed/created tension), Question (what needs to be resolved), Answer (the recommendation).

**Q4:** The answer/recommendation should come first.

**Q5:** 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Consultants use it to prioritize—focus analysis and action on the vital few that drive most of the outcome.

**Q6:** Summary restates findings. Synthesis extracts meaning—identifies patterns, draws conclusions, and implies action.

**Q7:** Start with a hypothesis (best guess at the answer), then gather only the data needed to prove/disprove it. Faster because it focuses effort rather than gathering everything "just in case."

**Q8:** The single most important insight that ties all findings together—the top of the pyramid.

**Q9:** A test to ensure every point has meaning/implication. Apply it to each finding/point by asking "so what?" If you can't answer, the point doesn't belong.

**Q10:** Any three of: want answers (not process), want recommendations (not options), want brevity, want confidence (not hedging), are time-constrained, have low tolerance for filler.

### Section B: MECE Analysis

**Q11:**
Problems with original:
- "Received better offer" overlaps with compensation (often the offer is better pay)
- "Company culture" overlaps with manager relationships, work-life balance, burnout
- "Poor work-life balance" and "burnout" significantly overlap
- Not structured—random list vs. organized categories

MECE Version:
```
Why are employees leaving?
├── Compensation & Benefits
│   ├── Base pay below market
│   ├── Benefits package inadequate
│   └── Equity/bonus not competitive
├── Career & Development
│   ├── Limited advancement opportunities
│   ├── Insufficient learning/growth
│   └── Skills becoming outdated
├── Work Experience
│   ├── Poor manager relationship
│   ├── Unsatisfying work content
│   └── Unsustainable workload/burnout
└── Environment & Culture
    ├── Misaligned values
    ├── Poor work-life balance
    └── Toxic team dynamics
```

**Q12:**
```
Why is e-commerce conversion rate declining?
├── Traffic Quality Issues
│   ├── Wrong audience reaching site
│   ├── Low-intent traffic sources growing
│   └── Declining brand awareness/consideration
├── Website/UX Issues
│   ├── Page load speed problems
│   ├── Navigation/findability issues
│   ├── Mobile experience degradation
│   └── Checkout friction
├── Product/Offer Issues
│   ├── Pricing not competitive
│   ├── Product availability/selection
│   └── Promotions less compelling
└── Trust/Credibility Issues
    ├── Reviews/ratings declining
    ├── Security concerns
    └── Return policy/guarantees
```

### Section C: Hypothesis-Driven Thinking

**Q13:**
Hypotheses for CAC increase:

H1: "Marketing efficiency has declined—we're reaching lower-quality leads"
- Confirm: Lead-to-opportunity rate declining; lower lead scores
- Disconfirm: Lead quality metrics stable

H2: "Competition has intensified—we're paying more for same audience"
- Confirm: CPM/CPC has increased; new competitors in same channels
- Disconfirm: Media costs stable; competitive set unchanged

H3: "Sales conversion has worsened—marketing is delivering but sales isn't closing"
- Confirm: Opportunity-to-close rate declining; sales cycle lengthening
- Disconfirm: Sales metrics stable; issue is truly upstream

**Q14:**
Day One Hypothesis for Grocery Chain:

**Core Hypothesis:** "Same-store sales decline is driven by competitive pressure from a new discount competitor, exacerbated by our failure to respond on price perception."

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Has competitive landscape actually changed?
- Which customer segments are declining most?
- Is this traffic-driven or basket-size-driven?

**Kickoff Questions:**
1. "What changed 6-7 months ago—any new competitors, store openings, or major market shifts?"
2. "Is the decline concentrated in certain stores/regions, or is it broad-based?"
3. "Are we seeing fewer customers, or are existing customers spending less?"

### Section D: Pyramid Principle

**Q15:**
Restructured:

"We should prioritize fixing onboarding—it's the highest-impact opportunity to improve retention and NPS.

**Why onboarding:**
- 45% of customers cite confusing onboarding
- Churn is highest in first 90 days (when onboarding matters most)
- This is fixable with our current resources

**Supporting context:**
- Current NPS of 32 vs. 45 industry average
- 60% cite pricing concerns (but pricing changes are more complex and slower)
- 35% cite support response times (secondary priority)

**Recommended actions:**
1. Redesign onboarding flow by end of Q1
2. Add dedicated onboarding specialist role
3. Track 90-day retention as key metric

Next step: Review proposed onboarding redesign in Monday's meeting."

**Q16:**
1. "Q3 revenue exceeded target by 8%, driven by enterprise segment growth"
2. "Competitor X is vulnerable: integration issues have stalled their product roadmap"
3. "Customer satisfaction improved 12 points, now exceeding industry benchmark"
4. "Digital transformation is on track: 3 of 4 milestones delivered"
5. "Invest $5M in customer success to reduce churn from 12% to 8%"

### Section E: Synthesis

**Q17:**
**Governing Thought:** "We're losing our innovation edge—our R&D engine is broken just as the market demands more innovation than ever."

**Narrative:** "Despite our market leadership, we're in danger. New entrants are capturing share through innovation, and 70% of our customers want more from us. Yet our R&D productivity has collapsed—we've added 50% more engineers but our success rate has halved and time-to-market nearly doubled. Unless we fix our R&D engine, our 45% market share will erode. We recommend a fundamental overhaul of our product development process, not more headcount."

**Q18:**
**Finding:** "Top 10 customers (8%) generate 65% of revenue"

**Observation:** "We have dangerous customer concentration"

**Insight:** "If we lose any one of these customers, it would represent 6-7% revenue impact—potentially devastating to annual performance"

**Implication:** "We need both defensive (retention) and offensive (diversification) strategies"

**Action:** "Implement dedicated account teams for top 10 customers with executive sponsorship, and launch mid-market acquisition program to reduce concentration over 3 years"

### Section F: Executive Communication

**Q19:**
"Acme Corp—20% of our revenue—signaled yesterday they're evaluating competitors. Three issues: pricing (they want 15% reduction), support responsiveness (they've had escalation issues), and missing features on our roadmap.

My recommendation: I'm meeting their CEO Thursday with a retention package—10% price reduction, dedicated support team, and commitment to deliver their top feature request by Q2.

I need your authorization on the pricing flexibility. Without action this week, we risk losing them at contract renewal in 60 days."

**Q20:**
"You're right—the results aren't where we projected. Let me be direct about what happened and what we're doing.

The investment thesis was sound, but we underestimated two things: competitor response time (they moved faster than we modeled) and customer adoption curve (it's taking 40% longer).

What this isn't: a market sizing error or strategic mistake. The opportunity is still there.

My responsibility: I should have built in more conservative timing assumptions and flagged competitor response as a higher risk.

Path forward: We have two options. One, double down—invest an additional $3M to accelerate customer acquisition while the window is still open. Two, cut losses—write off $4M and redeploy. My recommendation is option one, but only if we fix the sales process issues we've identified. I can have a detailed plan to you by Friday.

What questions do you have?"

### Section G: Integrated Case

**Q21:**
**a) Governing Thought:**
"Profit decline is primarily driven by controllable factors—product mix and manufacturing efficiency—that we can address through pricing discipline and operational improvement."

**b) SCQA:**
**Situation:** "We've maintained revenue stability over the past year despite challenging market conditions."
**Complication:** "But profits declined 20%. The mix has shifted toward lower-margin products, material costs spiked, and our manufacturing efficiency has slipped."
**Question:** "How should we restore profitability?"
**Answer:** "Focus on two priorities: implement value-based pricing to improve mix, and launch operational excellence program to recapture efficiency. These two levers address 75% of the decline and are within our control."

**c) Logic Tree:**
```
Restore profitability through pricing and operations
├── Improve product mix (addresses 40% of decline)
│   ├── Value-based pricing on premium products
│   ├── Sales incentives aligned to margin
│   └── SKU rationalization of lowest-margin items
├── Improve manufacturing efficiency (addresses 15% + mitigates 35%)
│   ├── Lean implementation in key facilities
│   ├── Automation of high-labor processes
│   └── Supplier renegotiation for materials
└── Sustain through governance
    ├── Monthly margin reviews by product
    ├── Pricing approval process
    └── Efficiency KPIs for operations
```

**d) One-Slide Summary:**
- **Headline:** "Restore profit margin to prior levels through pricing discipline and operational excellence—targeting $[X]M improvement by year-end"
- **Three columns:**
  - Product Mix (40%): Value-based pricing, sales incentives, SKU rationalization
  - Operations (50%): Lean program, automation, supplier negotiation
  - Governance (sustaining): Monthly reviews, approval processes, KPIs
- **Footer:** Investment required: $[X]M | Timeline: 12 months | Expected improvement: $[X]M
