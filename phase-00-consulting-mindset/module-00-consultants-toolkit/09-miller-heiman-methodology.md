## Introduction

While McKinsey, Bain, and BCG frameworks dominate problem-solving, **Miller Heiman** dominates B2B sales methodology. As a CEO or consultant, you need both:

- **McKinsey frameworks** - Solve client problems
- **Miller Heiman frameworks** - Win the work to solve those problems

This topic introduces the key Miller Heiman tools and shows how they complement the consulting methodologies you've already learned.

## The Three Core Frameworks

### 1. Strategic Selling (Blue Sheet)

**Purpose:** Analyze complex sales opportunities with multiple decision-makers.

The Blue Sheet provides a structured approach to:
- Define exactly what you're selling
- Map all stakeholders (buying influences)
- Identify risks (red flags) and strengths
- Develop a winning strategy

**When to Use:** Large, complex B2B opportunities with multiple stakeholders.

### 2. Conceptual Selling (Green Sheet)

**Purpose:** Plan and execute effective sales conversations.

The Green Sheet helps you:
- Prepare for customer meetings
- Ask the right questions
- Discover customer needs
- Move the sale forward

**When to Use:** Any customer meeting where you need to advance the opportunity.

### 3. LAMP / Gold Sheet

**Purpose:** Develop and grow strategic accounts.

The Large Account Management Process helps you:
- Build long-term account relationships
- Identify growth opportunities
- Create account-specific strategies
- Expand your footprint

**When to Use:** Your largest, most strategic client relationships.

## Blue Sheet: Strategic Selling

### Single Sales Objective (SSO)

Every Blue Sheet starts with a clear, specific objective:

**Template:**
```
"By [DATE], gain approval from [DECISION-MAKER] to award a
$[VALUE] contract for [SPECIFIC SERVICES]."
```

**Good SSO Example:**
"By March 15, gain approval from the State Health Director to award a $450,000 contract for public health dashboard implementation services."

**Bad SSO Example:**
"Get the State to buy our analytics services." (Too vague)

### The Four Buying Influences

Every B2B decision involves four types of buyers:

| Type | Role | Key Question | Your Approach |
|------|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Economic Buyer** | Final approval, releases funds | "Will this ROI justify the investment?" | Quantify value, address ROI |
| **User Buyer** | Uses solution daily | "Will this make my job easier?" | Understand workflow, demo usability |
| **Technical Buyer** | Screens options, can say "no" | "Does this meet requirements?" | Address specs, compliance, integration |
| **Coach** | Guides you through the sale | "How can I help you win?" | Build relationship, seek guidance |

### Red Flags and Strengths

**Red Flags** are risks that could derail your opportunity:
- No access to Economic Buyer
- Technical Buyer is hostile
- No internal Coach identified
- Competitor has incumbent relationship
- Budget not confirmed
- Unclear decision timeline

**Strengths** are assets that support your position:
- Strong relationship with Coach
- Prior successful engagement
- Superior technical solution
- Competitive pricing
- Excellent references

### Win Strategy

Your win strategy answers: "Why will we win this opportunity?"

Components:
1. **Unique Value Proposition** - What do you offer that competitors don't?
2. **Competitive Differentiators** - Where are you clearly better?
3. **Relationship Leverage** - Who supports you and why?
4. **Action Plan** - What specific steps will you take?

## Green Sheet: Conceptual Selling

### The Five Question Types

Effective sales conversations use five types of questions:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Confirmation** | Verify your understanding | "So your team currently handles 500 support tickets per day?" |
| **New Information** | Discover unknown needs | "What happens during peak periods when volume doubles?" |
| **Attitude** | Understand feelings | "How do you feel about the current approach?" |
| **Commitment** | Test readiness to act | "If we solved this problem, what would the next step be?" |
| **Basic Issue** | Uncover fundamental concerns | "What's really driving this initiative?" |

### Question Sequencing

```
1. Start with Confirmation Questions
   └── Verify what you think you know

2. Move to New Information Questions
   └── Discover what you don't know

3. Use Attitude Questions
   └── Understand emotional drivers

4. Ask Basic Issue Questions
   └── Get to the core need

5. Close with Commitment Questions
   └── Determine next steps
```

### Meeting Planning

Before every customer meeting, prepare:

| Element | Your Preparation |
|---------|------------------|
| Primary Objective | What must you achieve? |
| Minimum Acceptable Outcome | What's the floor? |
| Questions to Ask | 3-5 prepared questions by type |
| Potential Concerns | What objections might arise? |
| Commitment Sought | What action do you want? |

## Motivation Discovery: The Harry Browne Framework

Beyond Miller Heiman, effective salespeople understand buyer psychology. The **Harry Browne framework** identifies two motivational drivers:

### Pain Points (8 Categories)

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Financial | Budget pressure, cost overruns, revenue shortfall |
| Operational | Inefficiency, manual processes, errors |
| Competitive | Losing market share, behind competitors |
| Compliance | Regulatory risk, audit findings, legal exposure |
| Efficiency | Wasted time, redundant work, slow processes |
| Growth | Can't scale, capacity constraints, missed opportunities |
| Technology | Outdated systems, integration issues, security gaps |
| People | Talent gaps, turnover, skills shortage |

### Pleasure Motivators (8 Categories)

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Revenue | Growth, new markets, upselling |
| Efficiency | Time savings, automation, streamlining |
| Recognition | Awards, visibility, advancement |
| Innovation | Being first, cutting-edge, thought leadership |
| Risk Mitigation | Reduced exposure, insurance, protection |
| Simplification | Less complexity, easier management |
| Growth | Market expansion, new capabilities |
| Competitive | Beating rivals, market leadership |

### Motivation Scoring

Rate each pain point and pleasure motivator (1-10):

```
PAIN ASSESSMENT
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Financial:    ████████░░ 8                 │
│ Operational:  ███████░░░ 7                 │
│ Compliance:   █████████░ 9  ← HIGHEST      │
│ Technology:   ██████░░░░ 6                 │
│ People:       ████░░░░░░ 4                 │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘

PLEASURE ASSESSMENT
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Recognition:  ████████░░ 8  ← HIGHEST      │
│ Risk Mitigation: ███████░░░ 7              │
│ Efficiency:   ██████░░░░ 6                 │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Insight:** This buyer is most motivated by avoiding compliance risk and gaining recognition. Lead with compliance messaging, but also show how solving this problem will make them look good.
