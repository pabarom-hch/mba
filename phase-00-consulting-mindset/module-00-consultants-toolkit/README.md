# Module 0: The Consultant's Toolkit

## Overview

This module teaches you to think like a McKinsey, Bain, or BCG consultant. These frameworks form the analytical backbone you'll use throughout this entire curriculum and your career as a CEO.

Top-tier consultants aren't smarter than everyone else—they have a systematic approach to problem-solving that produces reliable, high-quality analysis under time pressure. Master these tools, and you'll be able to tackle any business problem with confidence.

## Why This Matters for CEOs

As CEO, you will:

- **Face ambiguous, complex problems daily** - Structured thinking helps you cut through noise
- **Have limited time** - Hypothesis-driven approaches save weeks of unfocused analysis
- **Need to make decisions with incomplete information** - These frameworks help you move forward confidently
- **Communicate with boards, investors, and teams** - Pyramid Principle ensures your message lands
- **Lead strategy discussions** - Issue trees keep conversations focused and productive

The best CEOs think like consultants—structured, efficient, and decisive.

## How Consulting Firms Use These Tools

### McKinsey
- Heavy emphasis on MECE and issue trees
- "One-slide answer" culture (Pyramid Principle in action)
- Hypothesis-driven problem solving
- Structured communication frameworks

### Bain
- Results-oriented approach
- Strong emphasis on implementation
- Use of "decision frameworks"
- Focus on "true north" (guiding hypothesis)

### BCG
- Balance of quantitative and qualitative analysis
- Scenario-based thinking
- Strategic framing before analysis
- Synthesis-heavy approach

## Recommended Sequence

1. **Start with Topic 1** (Structured Problem Solving) - The meta-framework
2. **Topics 2-4 together** - Core analytical tools
3. **Topics 5-7 together** - Communication and synthesis
4. **Topic 8** - Executive application
5. **Cases** - Apply all frameworks together
6. **Assessment** - Test your mastery

## Key Frameworks Summary

| Framework | When to Use | Key Question |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Issue Tree | Breaking down problems | "What are all the components?" |
| MECE | Ensuring completeness | "Are these mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive?" |
| Hypothesis-Driven | Accelerating analysis | "What do I believe is true? How do I test it?" |
| 80/20 | Prioritizing effort | "What 20% drives 80% of impact?" |
| Pyramid Principle | Communicating | "What's my main point? What supports it?" |
| SCQA | Framing | "Situation, Complication, Question, Answer?" |
