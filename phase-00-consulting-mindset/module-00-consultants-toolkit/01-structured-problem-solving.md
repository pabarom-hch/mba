# Structured Problem Solving

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the consultant's approach to tackling complex, ambiguous problems
- Learn the end-to-end problem-solving process used by top consulting firms
- Apply structured thinking to break down any business challenge
- Avoid common pitfalls that lead to wasted effort and weak recommendations

---

## Introduction

Most people approach problems reactively—they jump into data collection, conduct unfocused research, and hope insights emerge. This approach works for simple problems but fails spectacularly with complex business challenges.

Consultants approach problems differently. They use a structured, disciplined methodology that:
- Ensures no important aspect is overlooked
- Focuses effort on the highest-impact areas
- Produces actionable recommendations, not just observations
- Works reliably across industries and problem types

This topic teaches you that methodology.

## Core Concepts

### The Problem-Solving Process

Top consulting firms follow a remarkably similar process:

```

### Step 1: Define the Problem

**The most common mistake is solving the wrong problem.**

Before any analysis, clarify:
- **What is the actual problem?** (Not symptoms, but root issue)
- **Who owns this problem?** (Decision maker)
- **What does success look like?** (Measurable outcome)
- **What constraints exist?** (Time, budget, political)
- **What's the scope?** (What's in/out of bounds)

**The Problem Statement Formula:**

```
[Decision maker] needs to decide [specific decision]
in order to [achieve specific outcome]
given [key constraints/context]
```

**Example - Weak Problem Statement:**
"Our profits are declining."

**Example - Strong Problem Statement:**
"The CEO needs to decide whether to exit the European market, restructure operations, or invest in growth by Q2, in order to return to 15% EBITDA margins within 18 months, given declining market share and a $50M capital constraint."

### Step 2: Structure the Problem

Once defined, decompose the problem into components using **issue trees** (covered in Topic 4).

Key principles:
- **MECE** - Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive
- **Hypothesis-driven** - Start with a point of view
- **Actionable** - Each branch leads to a potential action

**Example Structure for Profitability Problem:**

```
How can we improve profitability?
├── Increase Revenue
│   ├── Raise prices
│   ├── Increase volume
│   └── Enter new markets
└── Decrease Costs
    ├── Reduce variable costs
    ├── Reduce fixed costs
    └── Improve efficiency
```

### Step 3: Prioritize

Not all issues are equally important. Use **80/20 analysis** to identify:
- Which branches have the largest potential impact?
- Which can be addressed given constraints?
- Which have the most uncertainty (need analysis)?

**Prioritization Matrix:**

```
                    IMPACT
                 Low    High
            ┌─────────┬─────────┐
       Low  │  Ignore │ Quick   │
EFFORT      │         │  Wins   │
            ├─────────┼─────────┤
       High │  Avoid  │ Major   │
            │         │ Projects│
            └─────────┴─────────┘
```

### Step 4: Analyze

For each prioritized branch:
1. **Form a hypothesis** - "I believe X is true because..."
2. **Identify what data would prove/disprove it**
3. **Gather that specific data** - No more, no less
4. **Analyze and conclude**

This is **hypothesis-driven analysis** (covered in Topic 2).

### Step 5: Synthesize

Synthesis ≠ Summary

- **Summary**: "We found A, B, and C"
- **Synthesis**: "A, B, and C together mean X, which implies we should do Y"

Synthesis answers: **"So what?"**

### Step 6: Recommend

Every analysis should end with a clear recommendation:
- **What** should be done (specific actions)
- **Why** this is the right answer (logic and evidence)
- **How** to implement (next steps)
- **What risks** exist and how to mitigate

**The Recommendation Test:**
If the decision maker can't act on your recommendation immediately, it's not actionable enough.

### Step 7: Communicate

Use the **Pyramid Principle** (covered in Topic 5):
- Lead with the answer
- Group supporting arguments
- Order logically
- Provide evidence at the bottom

## Consulting Application

### How McKinsey Structures Engagements

A typical McKinsey engagement follows this flow:

**Week 1: Define and Structure**
- Clarify problem statement with client
- Build initial issue tree
- Form day-one hypotheses
- Design work plan

**Weeks 2-4: Prioritize and Analyze**
- Test hypotheses through analysis
- Conduct interviews
- Build models
- Iterate on structure as learning emerges

**Week 5-6: Synthesize and Recommend**
- Develop "so what" insights
- Build recommendation
- Pressure-test with client
- Prepare final presentation

**The "Day One Answer"**

Consultants form a preliminary answer on day one based on:
- Pattern recognition from similar situations
- Initial data review
- Client conversations

This isn't arrogance—it's efficiency. Having a hypothesis focuses all subsequent work.

## CEO Application

As CEO, you face dozens of problems competing for attention. Structured problem solving helps you:

### Triage Effectively
Use problem definition to quickly assess:
- Is this really my problem to solve?
- What's the actual decision needed?
- What's the time frame and stakes?

### Delegate with Clarity
A well-defined problem statement enables clean delegation:
- Clear scope prevents scope creep
- Success criteria enable accountability
- Constraints set realistic boundaries

### Run Productive Strategy Sessions
Use issue trees to structure board discussions:
- Everyone works from the same structure
- Prevents circular conversations
- Identifies where disagreements actually lie

### Make Faster Decisions
With practice, you'll structure problems automatically:
- See the components instantly
- Focus on the critical few
- Move to decision faster

## Worked Example

### Situation
TechCorp's SaaS platform has seen customer churn increase from 5% to 12% annually over 18 months. The CEO has asked for recommendations to address this.

### Step 1: Define

**Weak Definition:** "Customer churn is too high."

**Strong Definition:** "The CEO needs to decide which 2-3 initiatives to prioritize and fund (from a $10M budget) to reduce annual churn from 12% to below 7% within 12 months, given that our largest competitor just raised prices 15% and we cannot make major product changes until Q3."

### Step 2: Structure

```
Why is churn increasing?
├── Customer-related factors
│   ├── Changing needs (no longer need product)
│   ├── Dissatisfaction (unhappy with product/service)
│   └── Economic factors (budget cuts)
│
├── Product-related factors
│   ├── Functionality gaps vs. competitors
│   ├── Reliability/performance issues
│   └── User experience problems
│
├── Service-related factors
│   ├── Poor onboarding
│   ├── Inadequate support
│   └── Lack of customer success engagement
│
└── Competitive factors
    ├── Lower-priced alternatives
    ├── Better-featured alternatives
    └── Aggressive competitor sales tactics
```

### Step 3: Prioritize

After initial analysis:
- Dissatisfaction and service factors account for 65% of churn
- Product gaps account for 25%
- Economic factors account for 10%

**Priority:** Focus on dissatisfaction and service factors first.

### Step 4: Analyze

**Hypothesis:** "Most churn comes from inadequate onboarding, leading to low adoption, leading to perceived low value."

**Data gathered:**
- Customers with <50% feature adoption churn at 3x the rate
- 60% of churned customers never completed onboarding
- Competitor NPS scores 25 points higher on "ease of getting started"

**Conclusion:** Hypothesis confirmed. Onboarding is the critical lever.

### Step 5: Synthesize

"Our churn problem is fundamentally an onboarding problem. Customers who don't adopt key features quickly never see value, and eventually leave. While we have product gaps, addressing them won't help if customers never experience the product fully."

### Step 6: Recommend

**Primary Recommendation:** Invest $6M in redesigned onboarding and customer success program.

1. Redesign onboarding (60-day program vs. current 7-day)
2. Implement automated adoption tracking with intervention triggers
3. Add 5 customer success managers for high-value accounts
4. Create self-service training academy

**Expected Impact:** Reduce churn to 6% within 12 months (based on benchmarks from companies that made similar changes).

**Risks:**
- Implementation takes longer than planned → Mitigation: Phase rollout starting with highest-value customers
- Sales team deprioritizes adoption metrics → Mitigation: Add adoption to comp plan

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Solving the Wrong Problem
**Symptom:** Analysis is complete but recommendations feel disconnected from what matters.
**Fix:** Spend more time on problem definition. Get explicit sign-off before analyzing.

### 2. Boiling the Ocean
**Symptom:** Massive data collection with no clear purpose.
**Fix:** Always work from hypotheses. Only gather data that tests a specific hypothesis.

### 3. Analysis Paralysis
**Symptom:** Endless refinement of analysis without moving to recommendations.
**Fix:** Set time boxes. "What decision can I make with 70% confidence?"

### 4. MECE Obsession
**Symptom:** Perfect structure but no insight.
**Fix:** Structure is a tool, not an end. Imperfect structure with insight beats perfect structure without.

### 5. Leading with Data, Not Insight
**Symptom:** Presentations that are data dumps.
**Fix:** Apply Pyramid Principle. Lead with "so what," support with data.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Define before solving** - A well-defined problem is half-solved
2. **Structure creates clarity** - Break problems into MECE components
3. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Not all issues deserve equal attention
4. **Hypothesize early** - Work backwards from potential answers
5. **Synthesize, don't summarize** - Extract meaning, not just facts
6. **Recommend specifically** - Actionable next steps, not vague direction
7. **Communicate top-down** - Lead with the answer

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Problem Definition
A retail chain CEO says: "Our stores aren't performing well."
Write a proper problem statement that would enable structured analysis.

### Problem 2: Structuring
A software company is deciding whether to build a mobile app.
Create a first-level issue tree to structure this decision.

### Problem 3: Prioritization
You have 3 weeks to analyze why a manufacturing plant's output declined 20%. You've identified 15 potential root causes.
Describe how you would prioritize which causes to investigate first.
