# Executive Communication

## Learning Objectives

- Communicate effectively with C-suite executives and boards
- Structure presentations for maximum impact with time-constrained audiences
- Handle tough questions and pushback confidently
- Adapt communication style to different executive audiences

---

## Introduction

Everything you've learned—structured problem solving, MECE, issue trees, the Pyramid Principle, synthesis—comes together in executive communication. This is where insight becomes impact.

Executives are different audiences. They're time-starved, context-switching constantly, and have seen thousands of presentations. They spot BS instantly. They want answers, not process.

This topic teaches you to communicate in a way that respects their time and drives decisions.

## Core Concepts

### The Executive Mindset

**What executives want:**
- Answers, not analysis
- Recommendations, not options
- Clarity, not comprehensiveness
- Action, not information
- Confidence, not hedging

**What executives don't want:**
- Your process ("First we gathered data, then we...")
- Excessive caveats ("This might be wrong, but...")
- Raw data without interpretation
- Obvious statements
- Uncertainty without a path forward

**The 30-Second Test:**
If an executive gives you 30 seconds, can you deliver your core message? If not, you're not ready.

### The Executive Communication Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    ANSWER (10%)                              │
│    Lead with the recommendation or key message               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                  SUPPORTING LOGIC (20%)                      │
│    3-4 key points that support the answer                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    EVIDENCE (30%)                            │
│    Data, analysis, examples that prove the logic            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    BACKUP (40%)                              │
│    Appendix, detail, methodology for those who want it      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

       ↑ What executives listen to (top 30%)
       ↓ What's available if they want to dig (bottom 70%)
```

### Rule of Three

Executives retain three things. Not five. Not seven. Three.

**Bad:** "There are eight factors driving the decline..."
**Good:** "Three factors explain 85% of the decline..."

If you have more than three points, group them into three categories.

### Assertion-Based Communication

Every statement should be an assertion (a claim), not a description.

**Description (Weak):**
"The market analysis shows various trends in customer behavior."

**Assertion (Strong):**
"Customers are shifting to digital twice as fast as we assumed."

**Test:** Would someone disagree? If not, it's not an assertion—it's filler.

### Headlines, Not Topics

Whether in slides, emails, or verbal updates, use headlines.

| Topics (Weak) | Headlines (Strong) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Market Update" | "Market is growing 15%, faster than expected" |
| "Financial Results" | "Q3 missed by 8%, driven by delayed deals, not lost demand" |
| "Competitive Analysis" | "Competitor X is vulnerable: their integration is failing" |
| "Recommendation" | "Acquire Target Y for $200M before Competitor Z does" |

### Managing Time Scarcity

Executives' calendars are fractured. Your meeting might get cut from 60 to 15 minutes. Be ready.

**The Accordion Principle:**
Build presentations that can expand or contract:

- **5 minutes:** Answer + 3 supporting points (verbal)
- **15 minutes:** Add one key evidence slide per point
- **30 minutes:** Add context, alternatives considered, risks
- **60 minutes:** Full presentation with Q&A and appendix dive

**Never Bury the Punchline:**
If you only get 60 seconds, they should still hear your answer.

### Handling Questions

**Listen Fully:**
Don't interrupt. Don't start formulating while they're talking.

**Pause Before Answering:**
Shows thoughtfulness. Prevents rambling.

**Answer Directly First:**
"Yes." "No." "It depends on X." Then elaborate.

**Acknowledge Uncertainty:**
"I don't have that data, but I'll get it to you by tomorrow."
Never bluff. Executives smell it instantly.

**Bridge to Your Point:**
"That's an important question, and it connects to the third risk factor I mentioned..."

## Consulting Application

### The Partner-Ready Standard

At McKinsey, work must be "partner-ready"—meaning a senior partner could present it to a CEO without edits.

**Partner-Ready Checklist:**
- [ ] Headline tells the story (no topic titles)
- [ ] Answer is on the first slide
- [ ] Every slide passes "so what?" test
- [ ] No slide takes more than 30 seconds to explain
- [ ] Data is sourced and defensible
- [ ] Backup exists for every claim
- [ ] Presentation works at half the length

### The One-Slide Summary

Every engagement produces a one-slide summary that captures the entire answer:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HEADLINE: Action-oriented summary of recommendation               │
│                                                                    │
│  "Acquire TechCo for $250M to enter AI market, achieving           │
│   $500M incremental revenue by Year 5 at 25% IRR"                  │
│                                                                    │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Situation Room

When presenting to clients, consultants follow a ritual:

1. **Pre-wire key stakeholders** - No surprises in the meeting
2. **Read the room** - Who's supportive, skeptical, hostile?
3. **Lead with the answer** - Get it on the table immediately
4. **Manage discussion** - Don't let one person derail
5. **Land with next steps** - Always clear action items

---

## CEO Application

### Communicating to Your Board

**What Boards Want:**
- Strategic perspective, not operational detail
- Your judgment and recommendation
- Honest assessment of risks
- Confidence, not false certainty
- Respect for their time

**Board Presentation Structure:**

1. **Executive Summary (1 slide):** Key message, key numbers
2. **Strategic Context (2-3 slides):** What's changed, what it means
3. **Key Decisions (1-2 slides):** What you're recommending
4. **Risks & Mitigations (1 slide):** What could go wrong
5. **Ask (1 slide):** What you need from them
6. **Appendix:** All the detail for those who want it

**The CEO Pre-Read:**
Send materials 48 hours before. Board members who prepare can engage meaningfully. Those who don't aren't your target audience anyway.

### Communicating to Your Team

**All-Hands Meetings:**
- Lead with the "why" - context before content
- Be human - acknowledge challenges honestly
- Be clear about what's changing and what's not
- End with what you need from them

**Executive Team:**
- Higher candor, more nuance
- Debate is expected
- Still lead with your view

**Skip-Levels:**
- Listen more than talk
- Ask questions to understand
- Be careful with commitments

### Crisis Communication

**The CEO Crisis Framework:**

1. **Acknowledge immediately** - Don't hide
2. **Take responsibility** - Even if it wasn't your fault
3. **Explain what happened** - Simply, factually
4. **Explain what you're doing** - Concrete actions
5. **Commit to updates** - And follow through

**The Three Questions:**
- What happened?
- What are we doing about it?
- How do we prevent it from happening again?

## Worked Example

### Situation
You're presenting to the CEO about a strategic decision. You have 20 minutes scheduled, but she's running late and says you have 8 minutes.

### Preparation (Accordion-Ready)

**5-Minute Version:**
"We recommend acquiring TechCo for $250M. Three reasons: strategic fit—they fill our AI gap. Financial return—25% IRR, exceeding hurdle. Risk is manageable—we've retained key talent through packages. Decision needed by end of month or we lose exclusivity. Questions?"

**15-Minute Version:**
Add one slide per supporting point with key evidence.

**30-Minute Version:**
Add context on alternatives considered, detailed risk analysis, integration plan.

### The 8-Minute Reality

**Opening (30 seconds):**
"I'll be brief. We recommend acquiring TechCo for $250M. Let me give you three reasons and the key risk."

**Point 1 - Strategic Fit (90 seconds):**
"First, strategic fit. TechCo fills our AI capability gap—something we can't build in less than 3 years. They have 50 enterprise customers we don't reach. Their tech roadmap aligns with ours. This is the highest slide—" [show one-slide summary]

**Point 2 - Financial Returns (90 seconds):**
"Second, returns. 25% IRR against our 15% hurdle. Payback in 3 years. $50M in identified synergies, conservative estimate."

**Point 3 - Risk (90 seconds):**
"Third, risk. The main risk is talent flight. We've addressed it with retention packages covering the top 20 people. Integration risk is lower than typical—their platform is compatible with ours."

**Close (60 seconds):**
"We need a decision by month-end to maintain exclusivity. I recommend we proceed. What questions do you have?"

**Buffer (3 minutes):**
Handle questions. If she has none: "I have detailed backup on valuation, integration plan, and alternatives if you'd like to dive in. Otherwise, I'll follow up with a memo today."

### Handling Tough Questions

**CEO:** "What if the talent leaves anyway?"

**Poor Response:** "Well, we've done a lot of analysis on this, and we looked at retention statistics, and generally speaking in acquisitions..."

**Strong Response:** "That's the biggest risk. If the top 10 engineers leave, we lose about 40% of the value. Our mitigation: 3-year vesting retention packages worth $15M total, which we've tested with them confidentially. Their CTO has committed to stay. We also have contingency plans to hire replacements, though that's a 12-month delay. I'm confident but not certain—I'd put our talent retention probability at 80%."

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Burying the Lead
**Problem:** Answer comes on slide 15
**Fix:** Answer on slide 1, sentence 1

### 2. Defensive Posture
**Problem:** Excessive caveats, hedging, "on the other hand"
**Fix:** Take a position. Acknowledge risks, but lead with conviction.

### 3. Reading Slides
**Problem:** "As you can see on this slide..."
**Fix:** Speak to them, not the screen. Slides are visual aids.

### 4. Data Dumping
**Problem:** 50-slide deck with every analysis
**Fix:** Synthesis in the main deck. Appendix for detail.

### 5. No Clear Ask
**Problem:** Presentation ends with "Any questions?"
**Fix:** End with clear next steps and what you need from them

### 6. Not Prepared for Short Time
**Problem:** "I can't present this in 10 minutes"
**Fix:** Every presentation must accordion down to 5 minutes

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Lead with the answer** - First sentence, first slide
2. **Rule of three** - Executives remember three things
3. **Headlines, not topics** - Every title should be an assertion
4. **Accordion your content** - Be ready for any time slot
5. **Handle questions directly** - Yes/No first, then elaborate
6. **End with clear action** - What do you need from them?
7. **Respect their time** - Brevity is respect

---

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Accordion Exercise
You have a 30-slide presentation on entering a new market. Create a 1-slide, 3-slide, and 10-slide version outline.

### Problem 2: Tough Question
You recommended a $50M investment that the CEO approved. Six months later, results are 40% below plan.

The CEO asks: "What happened?"

Write a 60-second response.

### Problem 3: Topic to Headline
Convert these topic titles to headlines:
1. "Q3 Results Overview"
2. "Market Analysis"
3. "Implementation Plan"
4. "Risks and Challenges"
