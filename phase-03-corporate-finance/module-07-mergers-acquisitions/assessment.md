## Answer Key

### Section 1: Strategic Concepts

**Answer 1.1 (5 points):**
Three reasons M&A fails to create value (1.5 points each):

1. **Overpayment**: Winner's curse in auctions; overestimating synergies; emotional attachment to deals
2. **Integration failures**: Inability to capture synergies; cultural clashes; talent departures; customer disruption
3. **Strategic misfits**: Wrong strategic rationale; misunderstanding of target business; acquisition for growth rather than value

Improvement strategies (0.5 points):
- Disciplined valuation with walk-away prices
- Early and rigorous integration planning
- Clear strategic criteria before pursuing targets
- Post-deal reviews and organizational learning

**Answer 1.2 (5 points):**

| Type | Definition | Example | Primary Synergy |
|------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| Horizontal | Same industry competitors | Disney + Fox | Economies of scale, market power |
| Vertical | Buyer-supplier relationship | Amazon + Whole Foods | Supply chain control, margin capture |
| Conglomerate | Unrelated businesses | Berkshire + BNSF | Financial (limited operational) |

(1.5 points per type plus examples)

**Answer 1.3 (5 points):**

Favor Build (1.5 points):
- Capability is core to long-term strategy
- Time is not critical
- Internal talent is available
- Culture is competitive advantage
- Integration risk is high

Favor Buy (1.5 points):
- Speed to market is essential
- Capability is difficult to replicate
- Market window is closing
- Target has unique assets/talent
- Cost of building exceeds acquisition premium

(1 point for quality of reasoning)

**Answer 1.4 (5 points):**

Winner's Curse (2 points):
- In competitive auctions, winner often has most optimistic assumptions
- Winning may mean overpaying because you valued target highest (possibly incorrectly)

Protection strategies (3 points):
- Set maximum price before bidding; don't exceed
- Base synergies on conservative estimates
- Walk-away discipline regardless of competitive pressure
- Use experienced advisors for valuation reality checks
- Recognize auction dynamics and don't get caught up in competition

---

### Section 2: Deal Process

**Answer 2.1 (10 points):**

a) Process recommendation (3 points):
**Limited auction** with 5-10 carefully selected buyers
- Software businesses are specialized (need buyers who understand)
- Confidentiality important (employees, customers)
- Enough competition to maximize price
- More efficient than broad auction

b) Initial pool (2 points):
- 15-20 contacted (teaser level)
- 10-12 sign NDAs
- 6-8 receive full CIM
- 4-5 to final round

c) Timeline and milestones (3 points):
- Weeks 1-6: Prepare materials, develop buyer list
- Weeks 7-10: Contact buyers, distribute teasers, NDAs
- Weeks 11-14: Distribute CIM, Q&A
- Weeks 15-18: Management presentations, preliminary bids
- Weeks 19-24: Select finalists, detailed DD
- Weeks 25-28: Final bids, select winner

Teaser: Anonymous, 1-2 pages, industry overview, key financial highlights, transaction summary
CIM: 50-100 pages, detailed company information, historical financials, projections, management team, growth opportunities

**Answer 2.2 (10 points):**

**Customer Concentration (3 points):**
- Pricing: Reduce price by 5-10% to reflect concentration risk
- Structure: Earnout tied to retaining this customer for 2 years
- Risk: Customer call to understand relationship stability; rep & warranty on customer contracts; material adverse change provision if customer lost pre-close

**Pending Lawsuit (3 points):**
- Pricing: Escrow or holdback for litigation amount (e.g., $5M)
- Structure: Special indemnity from seller for litigation outcome
- Risk: Legal review of case merits; insurance coverage check; seller retention of liability in purchase agreement

**Key Employee (4 points):**
- Pricing: Factor in retention cost ($1-2M retention package)
- Structure: Make closing conditioned on employee agreement; earnout tied to employee staying
- Risk: Meet with employee before close; negotiate employment/non-compete agreement; structure retention bonus (signing + 1-2 year vesting)

### Section 3: Deal Structure

**Answer 3.1 (8 points):**

| Factor | Stock Purchase | Asset Purchase |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Liability transfer | All (known and unknown) | Only assumed |
| Tax basis to buyer | Carryover (no step-up) | Stepped-up |
| Contract transfer | Automatic (mostly) | Requires consent |

(2 points per row)

Metric (1 point): Revenue or EBITDA (revenue less manipulable)

Period (1 point): 2 years (Years 1 and 2 post-close)

Structure (2 points):

Floating Exchange Ratio (2 points):
- Adjusts to deliver fixed dollar value
- Target gets certainty of value

Target Preference (2 points):
- Fixed: When target believes acquirer stock will increase; wants upside participation
- Floating: When target wants certainty; risk-averse shareholders; volatile acquirer stock

### Section 4: Merger Analysis

**Answer 4.1 (15 points):**

a) Exchange Ratio (2 points):
```
Target price with premium: $32 × 1.25 = $40
Acquirer stock price: $40
Exchange ratio: $40 / $40 = 1.0 acquirer share per target share
```

b) New Shares Issued (2 points):
```
Target shares: 12.5M
Exchange ratio: 1.0
New shares: 12.5M × 1.0 = 12.5M new shares
```

c) Pro Forma Net Income (4 points):
```
Acquirer Net Income:     $100.0M
Target Net Income:       $25.0M
Synergies (after tax):   $10M × (1 - 0.25) = $7.5M
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Pro Forma Net Income:    $132.5M
```

d) Pro Forma Shares (2 points):
```
Acquirer shares: 50M
New shares: 12.5M
Pro forma shares: 62.5M
```

e) Pro Forma EPS (2 points):
```
Pro Forma EPS = $132.5M / 62.5M = $2.12
```

f) Accretion/Dilution (3 points):
```
Standalone EPS: $100M / 50M = $2.00
Pro Forma EPS: $2.12
Accretion: ($2.12 - $2.00) / $2.00 = 6.0% accretive
```

**Answer 4.2 (10 points):**

a) Net Income Contribution (3 points):
```
Acquirer: $100M / $125M = 80%
Target: $25M / $125M = 20%
(Before synergies)
```

b) Revenue Contribution (3 points):
```
Acquirer: $500M / $650M = 76.9%
Target: $150M / $650M = 23.1%
```

c) Implied Ownership (2 points):
```
Target shareholders: 12.5M / 62.5M = 20% of combined
```

d) Fairness Analysis (2 points):
Target contributes:
- 20% of net income, gets 20% ownership → Fair
- 23.1% of revenue, gets 20% ownership → Slightly unfavorable

The exchange ratio is roughly fair based on earnings contribution but slightly unfavorable based on revenue. The 25% premium compensates target shareholders for the modest shortfall in revenue contribution allocation.
