## Introduction

Merger analysis translates the strategic rationale into financial reality. The core question: Does the transaction create or destroy value for shareholders? This analysis combines valuation concepts with detailed pro forma modeling to answer that question quantitatively.

---

## Core Concepts

### The Merger Analysis Framework

```
Key Analyses:

1. Accretion/Dilution Analysis
   - EPS impact to acquirer
   - First-year and steady-state

2. Pro Forma Financials
   - Combined income statement
   - Combined balance sheet
   - Credit metrics

3. Synergy Analysis
   - Cost synergies
   - Revenue synergies
   - One-time costs

4. Contribution Analysis
   - Who contributes what
   - Ownership implications

5. Exchange Ratio Analysis
   - Valuation-based
   - Contribution-based
   - Market-based
```

### Accretion vs. Dilution

```
Definition:

Accretive: Combined EPS > Acquirer standalone EPS
Dilutive: Combined EPS < Acquirer standalone EPS

Formula:
Pro Forma EPS = Combined Net Income / Pro Forma Shares

If Pro Forma EPS > Acquirer EPS → Accretive
If Pro Forma EPS < Acquirer EPS → Dilutive
```

### Why Deals Are Dilutive

```
Sources of Dilution:

1. Share Issuance
   More shares outstanding in denominator

2. Premium Paid
   Paying more than target's earnings contribution

3. Financing Costs
   Interest expense on debt used

4. Purchase Accounting
   Goodwill/intangible amortization
   Asset write-ups

5. Transaction Costs
   One-time fees and expenses
```

### Why Deals Become Accretive

```
Sources of Accretion:

1. Synergies
   Cost reductions, revenue enhancements

2. Multiple Arbitrage
   Buying target at lower multiple

3. Leverage Benefits
   Interest savings from target's cash

4. Tax Efficiencies
   NOL utilization, restructuring

5. Purchase Price Allocation
   Favorable accounting treatment
```

## Building the Pro Forma Model

### Step 1: Standalone Projections

```
Acquirer Standalone:

| Item | Current | Projected |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Revenue | $1,000M | $1,050M |
| Net Income | $100M | $105M |
| Shares | 50M | 50M |
| EPS | $2.00 | $2.10 |

Target Standalone:

| Item | Current | Projected |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Revenue | $200M | $210M |
| Net Income | $20M | $21M |
| Shares | 10M | 10M |
| EPS | $2.00 | $2.10 |
```

### Step 2: Transaction Assumptions

```
Key Assumptions:

Purchase Price: $300M
Premium: 50% over market ($200M)
Consideration: 50% cash / 50% stock

Cash Portion: $150M
- Source: New debt at 6% interest

Stock Portion: $150M
- Acquirer stock price: $30
- Shares issued: 5M new shares

Transaction Costs: $10M (expensed)

Purchase Accounting:
- Goodwill created: $150M
- Intangible write-up: $50M (10-year amortization)
```

### Step 3: Pro Forma Adjustments

```
Income Statement Adjustments:

Combined Revenue:
$1,050M + $210M = $1,260M

Combined Operating Income:
Before synergies

Financing Adjustments:
+ Foregone interest on cash: $0 (if no cash used)
- Interest on new debt: $150M × 6% = $9M

Purchase Accounting:
- Intangible amortization: $50M / 10 = $5M

Tax Adjustments:
+ Tax shield on interest: $9M × 25% = $2.25M
+ Tax shield on amortization: $5M × 25% = $1.25M

Synergies:
+ Cost synergies: $20M (Year 1)
- Tax on synergies: $5M

Transaction Costs:
- One-time: $10M (after-tax $7.5M)
```

### Step 4: Calculate Pro Forma EPS

```
Pro Forma Net Income:

Acquirer Net Income:          $105.0M
+ Target Net Income:          $21.0M
- Interest expense:           ($9.0M)
+ Interest tax shield:        $2.25M
- Intangible amortization:    ($5.0M)
+ Amortization tax shield:    $1.25M
+ Cost synergies:             $20.0M
- Synergy tax:                ($5.0M)
────────────────────────────────────────
Pro Forma Net Income:         $130.5M

(Excluding one-time transaction costs)

Pro Forma Shares:
Acquirer shares:              50M
+ New shares issued:          5M
────────────────────────────────
Pro Forma Shares:             55M

Pro Forma EPS:
$130.5M / 55M = $2.37

Accretion Analysis:
Standalone EPS: $2.10
Pro Forma EPS: $2.37
Accretion: ($2.37 - $2.10) / $2.10 = 12.9%
```

## Synergy Analysis

### Types of Synergies

**Cost Synergies (More Certain):**

```
Category          Typical %    Time to Realize
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Headcount         3-5% of OpEx    12-18 months
Facilities        1-2% of OpEx    18-24 months
Procurement       2-4% of COGS    12-24 months
Technology        1-2% of OpEx    24-36 months
Overhead          2-3% of SG&A    6-12 months
```

**Revenue Synergies (Less Certain):**

```
Category          Estimate       Confidence
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Cross-selling     5-10% of Rev   Medium-Low
Geographic        3-5% of Rev    Medium
New products      Variable       Low
Pricing power     1-3% of Rev    Medium
```

### Synergy Valuation

```
Cost Synergies:
Annual synergies: $30M
Tax rate: 25%
After-tax: $22.5M
Multiple: 6x (lower risk)
Value: $135M

Revenue Synergies:
Additional revenue: $50M
Margin: 25%
Incremental EBITDA: $12.5M
After-tax: $9.4M
Multiple: 8x (higher risk)
Value: $75M
Haircut (50%): $37.5M

Integration Costs:
One-time: $40M
After-tax: $30M

Net Synergy Value:
$135M + $37.5M - $30M = $142.5M
```

### Synergy Bridge

```
How Much Premium Can Synergies Support?

Target Standalone Value: $200M
Net Synergy Value: $142.5M
Maximum Value with Synergies: $342.5M

Premium Paid: $100M (50% premium)
Synergies Shared: 70% ($100M / $142.5M)
Synergies Retained: 30%

Rule of Thumb: Retain at least 25-50% of synergies
```

## Contribution Analysis

### Framework

```
Contribution Analysis asks:
"What % does each party contribute to the combined entity?"

Metrics Compared:
- Revenue
- EBITDA
- Net Income
- Assets
- Equity Value

Ownership should reflect contribution (in merger of equals)
```

### Contribution Matrix

```
Example: Merger of Equals

| Metric | Company A | Company B | A % | B % |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|-----|
| Revenue | $800M | $600M | 57% | 43% |
| EBITDA | $120M | $100M | 55% | 45% |
| Net Income | $70M | $60M | 54% | 46% |
| Employees | 3,000 | 2,500 | 55% | 45% |

Average Contribution: A = 55%, B = 45%

Implied Ownership: A shareholders get 55% of combined
                   B shareholders get 45% of combined
```

### Exchange Ratio from Contribution

```
If combined company worth $2,000M:

A shareholders: 55% × $2,000M = $1,100M
B shareholders: 45% × $2,000M = $900M

Current Market Caps:
Company A: $1,000M
Company B: $700M

Exchange Ratio (A acquires B):
B value in deal: $900M
B shares outstanding: 35M
Value per B share: $25.71
A share price: $20
Exchange: 1.29 A shares per B share

Premium to B:
Current B price: $20
Deal value: $25.71
Premium: 28.6%
```

---

## Exchange Ratio Analysis

### Setting the Exchange Ratio

**Approaches:**

```
1. Premium-Based
   Target price × (1 + premium) / Acquirer price

   Example: $20 × 1.30 / $25 = 1.04x

2. Contribution-Based
   Based on relative contribution metrics

   Example: If target contributes 35% of earnings
   and gets 30% of combined = 0.86x multiplier

3. Value-Based
   DCF values / shares

   Example: Target value $500M / 20M shares = $25
   Acquirer price $30
   Ratio: 0.83x
```

### Exchange Ratio Sensitivity

```
Fixed Ratio: 1.0 A share per B share

| A Stock Price | B Implied Value | B Premium |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| $25 | $25 | 25% |
| $30 | $30 | 50% |
| $35 | $35 | 75% |
| $20 | $20 | 0% |

Risk: B shareholders exposed to A stock fluctuation
```

### Collar Structures

```
Protect against stock price moves:

Collar Example:
- Fixed ratio: 1.0x
- Floor: If A < $20, ratio = $20/A (minimum value)
- Cap: If A > $30, ratio = $30/A (maximum shares)

Within collar ($20-$30): Fixed 1.0x ratio
Outside collar: Adjusts to protect value
```

Stock: $600M (15M new shares)
```

**Synergies:**

```
Cost Synergies: $50M (Year 1)
Revenue Synergies: $25M revenue × 30% margin = $7.5M
Integration Costs: $30M one-time
```

**Pro Forma Analysis:**

```
Step 1: Combined Net Income

TechCorp Net Income:           $200.0M
DataSoft Net Income:           $50.0M
Interest Expense:              ($20.0M)  [$400M × 5%]
Interest Tax Shield:           $5.0M     [@ 25%]
Cost Synergies:                $50.0M
Revenue Synergy Impact:        $7.5M
Tax on Synergies:              ($14.4M)  [@ 25%]
Amortization (intangibles):    ($10.0M)  [$100M over 10 years]
Amortization Tax Shield:       $2.5M
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pro Forma Net Income:          $270.6M

Step 2: Pro Forma EPS

Shares: 100M + 15M = 115M
EPS: $270.6M / 115M = $2.35

Step 3: Accretion/Dilution

Standalone EPS: $200M / 100M = $2.00
Pro Forma EPS: $2.35
Accretion: 17.5%
```

**Contribution Analysis:**

```
| Metric | TechCorp | DataSoft | TC % | DS % |
|--------|----------|----------|------|------|
| Revenue | $2,000M | $500M | 80% | 20% |
| EBITDA | $400M | $100M | 80% | 20% |
| Net Income | $200M | $50M | 80% | 20% |

Average: 80% / 20%

Ownership in Combined:
TechCorp: 100M / 115M = 87%
DataSoft: 15M / 115M = 13%

DataSoft contributes 20% but gets 13%
Premium absorbed by TechCorp shareholders
Justified by: Synergy value ($142M PV) > Premium paid ($200M)
```

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

```
Accretion/(Dilution) at Various Synergy Levels:

| Synergies | Pro Forma NI | EPS | A/(D) |
|-----------|--------------|-----|-------|
| $0 | $225.6M | $1.96 | (2.0%) |
| $25M | $243.4M | $2.12 | 6.0% |
| $50M | $261.2M | $2.27 | 13.5% |
| $75M | $279.0M | $2.43 | 21.5% |

Break-even synergies: ~$10M (after tax)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Accretion isn't everything** - Strategic value may justify dilution
2. **Synergies drive accretion** - Most deals dilutive without synergies
3. **First year vs. long-term** - Path to value matters
4. **Contribution analysis** - Fairness check on ownership
5. **Sensitivity is critical** - Show range of outcomes
6. **Purchase accounting matters** - Non-cash but real impact
7. **Premium justification** - Must be supported by value creation

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Accretion/Dilution
Acquirer: 50M shares, $4.00 EPS, P/E 15x
Target: 10M shares, $2.00 EPS, P/E 10x
Deal: All stock at 20% premium
Calculate pro forma EPS and accretion/dilution.

### Problem 2: Synergy Break-Even
Same deal as Problem 1, but acquirer P/E = 18x, target P/E = 12x (dilutive).
What synergies (after-tax) are needed to break even?

### Problem 3: Exchange Ratio
Acquirer contributes 60% of combined EBITDA.
Target contributes 40% of combined EBITDA.
Combined entity worth $1B.
Calculate "fair" exchange ratio if both companies have same share count.
