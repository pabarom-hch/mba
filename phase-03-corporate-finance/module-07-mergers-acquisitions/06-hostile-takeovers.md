## Core Concepts

### What Makes a Takeover "Hostile"?

```
Definition:
An acquisition attempt opposed by target management and/or board

Characteristics:
├── Target board rejects offer
├── Direct appeal to shareholders
├── Potential proxy fight
├── Public and adversarial
└── Often involves premium offers

Distinction:
Friendly: Board-approved, negotiated
Hostile: Board-opposed, contested
```

### Why Go Hostile?

**Acquirer Motivations:**

```
1. Negotiations Failed
   - Price disagreement
   - Terms not accepted
   - Management resistance

2. Undervalued Target
   - Stock trades below intrinsic value
   - Market doesn't see potential
   - Activist playbook

3. Strategic Imperative
   - Must-have asset
   - Industry consolidation
   - Competitive pressure

4. Entrenched Management
   - Board protecting themselves
   - Not acting in shareholder interest
   - Principal-agent problem
```

### The Hostile Playbook

```
Typical Sequence:

Phase 1: Private Approach
├── Confidential offer to board
├── Bear hug letter
└── Try friendly first

Phase 2: Go Public
├── Public announcement of offer
├── Direct appeal to shareholders
└── Media campaign

Phase 3: Pressure Tactics
├── Tender offer
├── Proxy fight
├── Litigation
└── Consent solicitation

Phase 4: Resolution
├── Target capitulates
├── White knight emerges
├── Deal completed or withdrawn
```

## Hostile Tactics

### Tender Offer

```
Definition:
Direct offer to shareholders to purchase their shares

Mechanics:
1. Announcement at premium to market
2. SEC filing (Schedule TO)
3. Minimum 20 business days open
4. Conditioned on minimum acceptance
5. Withdrawal rights for shareholders

Example:
"We offer $50 per share (30% premium) for all shares.
Offer conditioned on 51% tender.
Expiration in 30 days."
```

**Tender Offer Requirements:**

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Disclosure | Schedule TO filing |
| Duration | Minimum 20 business days |
| Equal treatment | All shareholders same terms |
| Withdrawal | Shareholders can withdraw |
| Extension | Must extend if terms change |
| Proration | If oversubscribed |

### Proxy Fight

```
Definition:
Contest to elect directors favoring acquisition

Process:
1. File preliminary proxy (SEC)
2. Solicit shareholder votes
3. Nominate alternative slate
4. Win board seats
5. New board approves deal

Tactics:
- Investor presentations
- Vote solicitation
- ISS/Glass Lewis engagement
- Shareholder communications
```

### Bear Hug

```
Definition:
Public letter making private offer public

Purpose:
- Pressure board to engage
- Put shareholders on notice
- Create public leverage

Example Letter:
"Dear Board,
We have repeatedly approached you with
a proposal to acquire the company at $50
per share, representing a 35% premium.
We believe shareholders deserve to hear
this offer directly..."
```

### Saturday Night Special

```
Definition:
Surprise tender offer with short deadline

Characteristics:
- Announced on weekend (hence name)
- Historically very short deadline
- Designed to prevent response
- Now limited by Williams Act (20 days minimum)
```

### Two-Tier Offer

```
Definition:
Higher price for front-end shares, lower for back-end

Structure:
Front-end: $55 cash for first 51%
Back-end: $45 stock for remaining 49%
Blended: $50 average

Purpose:
- Creates urgency to tender
- Prisoners' dilemma for shareholders
- Now less common (fair price laws)
```

---

## Defensive Measures

### Pre-Offer Defenses

**Poison Pill (Shareholder Rights Plan):**

```
Mechanism:
If hostile acquirer exceeds threshold (e.g., 15%),
other shareholders get right to buy shares at discount

Effect:
- Massive dilution to acquirer
- Makes acquisition prohibitively expensive
- Effectively gives board veto power

Trigger: Usually 15-20% ownership
Exercise: 50% discount to market price
Result: Doubles share count, halves acquirer position

Note: Can be removed by shareholder vote
```

**Staggered Board:**

```
Structure:
Directors serve 3-year terms, 1/3 elected annually

Effect:
- Takes 2+ years to gain board control
- Proxy fight cannot win majority in one year
- Combined with pill = strong defense

Trend: Decreasing due to governance pressure
```

**Supermajority Provisions:**

```
Requirement:
Certain actions require 67-80% approval

Covered Actions:
- Mergers
- Charter amendments
- Board removal

Effect:
- Higher bar for hostile completion
- Acquirer needs more than simple majority
```

**Golden Parachutes:**

```
Definition:
Large severance payments triggered by change of control

Typical Structure:
- 2-3x annual compensation
- Accelerated equity vesting
- Benefits continuation

Effect:
- Increases acquisition cost
- May entrench management (negative)
- Aligns management with shareholders (argued)
```

### Post-Offer Defenses

**White Knight:**

```
Strategy:
Seek friendly acquirer to outbid hostile party

Process:
1. Board seeks alternatives
2. Find preferred buyer
3. Negotiate friendly deal
4. Higher price and/or better terms

Example:
Hostile bid: $50/share
White knight: $55/share, job protections
```

**White Squire:**

```
Strategy:
Friendly party buys minority stake to block hostile

Structure:
- Friendly investor acquires 10-15%
- Standstill agreement (won't sell to hostile)
- May have board seat

Effect:
- Reduces available float
- Friendly vote in proxy fight
- Doesn't require premium for all shares
```

**Pac-Man Defense:**

```
Strategy:
Target makes counter-bid for acquirer

Rare Because:
- Requires significant resources
- Often impractical size mismatch
- Escalates conflict dramatically

Historic Example:
Martin Marietta vs. Bendix (1982)
```

**Crown Jewel Defense:**

```
Strategy:
Sell or option valuable assets to third party

Structure:
- Lock-up option on key assets
- Triggered by hostile acquisition
- Makes target less attractive

Limitations:
- Fiduciary duty concerns
- May reduce value for shareholders
- Court scrutiny (Revlon duties)
```

**Greenmail:**

```
Definition:
Repurchase hostile bidder's shares at premium

Mechanics:
1. Raider accumulates shares
2. Threatens takeover
3. Company buys back at premium
4. Raider goes away

Regulation:
- 50% excise tax on greenmail
- Largely eliminated practice
```

---

## Legal Framework

### Fiduciary Duties

**Business Judgment Rule:**

```
Standard:
Directors protected if:
1. Acted in good faith
2. With due care
3. In best interests of corporation

Application:
- Presumption of propriety
- No second-guessing by courts
- Must have reasonable process
```

**Unocal Standard:**

```
When: Board takes defensive action

Test:
1. Reasonable grounds to believe threat exists
2. Response proportionate to threat

Enhanced Scrutiny:
- Board must show reasonable investigation
- Defense cannot be preclusive or coercive
```

**Revlon Duties:**

```
When: Company is "for sale"

Triggers:
- Active bidding contest
- Break-up of company
- Change of control transaction

Duty:
- Maximize shareholder value
- Board becomes "auctioneer"
- Cannot favor one bidder unreasonably
```

### Key Legal Cases

| Case | Holding | Significance |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Unocal (1985) | Proportionality test for defenses | Defense standard |
| Revlon (1986) | Must maximize value when for sale | Auction duties |
| Time-Warner (1989) | "Just say no" allowed if strategy | Long-term defense |
| Paramount (1994) | Can't lock up deal if Revlon applies | Lock-up limits |
| Airgas (2011) | Pill valid even with low threat | Pill strength |

## Worked Example

### Hostile Takeover Response

**Situation:**
MidCo (target) receives hostile tender offer from BigCorp

**The Offer:**
- $45/share (25% premium to current $36)
- All cash
- Conditioned on 51% tender
- No financing contingency

**MidCo Response Process:**

```
Week 1: Assessment
- Special committee formed (3 independent directors)
- Advisors engaged (investment bank, legal)
- Poison pill reviewed (in place, 15% trigger)

Analysis:
- DCF value: $48-55/share
- Trading comps: $42-48/share
- Management plan: $52/share in 3 years
- Conclusion: Offer undervalues company
```

```
Week 2: Public Response
- Board rejects offer as inadequate
- Issues statement with rationale
- Reaffirms strategic plan
- Poison pill remains in place

BigCorp Response:
- Launches proxy fight
- Nominates 4 directors
- Increases pressure
```

```
Week 3-6: Defense
- MidCo seeks white knight
- Contacts 3 strategic buyers
- One expresses interest (WhiteCo)
- Negotiates with WhiteCo

Outcome:
- WhiteCo offers $52/share (15% higher)
- Friendly deal negotiated
- BigCorp walks away
- MidCo shareholders receive $52
```

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Defense Evaluation
A company with a poison pill and staggered board receives a hostile tender offer at 30% premium. What options does the board have?

### Problem 2: Fiduciary Analysis
The board rejects a 40% premium offer, claiming the company is worth more. Three years later, the stock is 20% lower. Was the board's decision defensible?

### Problem 3: White Knight
Hostile bid is $50/share all cash. White knight offers $48/share in stock. Which should the board recommend and why?
