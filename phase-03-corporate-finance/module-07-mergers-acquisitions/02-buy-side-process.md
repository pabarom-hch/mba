+ Synergy Value (Buyer-specific)
↓
= Maximum Value to Buyer
↓
- Required Returns
↓
= Maximum Bid Price
↓
vs.
↓
Seller Expectations
```

### Synergy Valuation

```

Facilities:          $5M
Procurement:         $3M
Technology:          $2M
Total Cost:          $25M

Revenue Synergies (Year 5):
Cross-sell:          $20M (50% haircut applied)

Synergy Value:
Cost: $25M × 6x multiple = $150M
Revenue: $20M × 20% margin × 8x = $32M
Total Synergy Value: $182M
One-time costs: ($40M)
Net Synergy Value: $142M

Sharing with Seller:
Industry norm: 25-40% to seller
Synergy value to share: $35-$55M

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Screening Criteria
Develop a target screening criteria for a regional bank ($5B assets) seeking acquisitions.

### Problem 2: Due Diligence
You have 4 weeks for due diligence. Prioritize workstreams and allocate time for a software company acquisition.

### Problem 3: Bid Strategy
In a 3-bidder auction, you believe standalone value is $100M and your synergies are $30M. What's your indicative bid strategy?
