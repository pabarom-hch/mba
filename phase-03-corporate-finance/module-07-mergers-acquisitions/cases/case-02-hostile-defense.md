```

- 2 directors up for election

Effect: Full board control requires 2 elections (2+ years)
Limitation: Combined with pill, delays but doesn't prevent
```

**3. "Just Say No" Defense**
```
Approach: Maintain defenses, refuse to negotiate
Basis: Board believes company worth more
Requirement: Good faith belief offer inadequate

Risk: Shareholder pressure, proxy fight
```

**4. White Knight**
```
Approach: Find friendly alternative buyer
Candidates:
- Johnson & Johnson (prior interest rumored)
- Medtronic (strategic fit)
- Private equity consortium

Challenge: Finding higher bid
```

**5. Recapitalization**
```
Approach: Special dividend or buyback
Structure: $20/share dividend + value remaining

Challenge: Leverage implications, doesn't maximize value
```

## Exhibit 5: Stakeholder Positions

### Shareholder Communications Received

**Apex Capital (12% holder):**
```
"The GlobalHealth offer deserves serious consideration.
A 30% premium is attractive. We expect the board to
engage constructively and run a fair process."
```

**ValueFirst Partners (8% holder):**
```
"We have long believed MedDevice is undervalued. The
management plan presented in February is compelling.
We support the board in exploring all alternatives
but believe standalone value exceeds $65."
```

**Governance Advisory Firm (ISS):**
```
"The board should not maintain the poison pill
indefinitely in the face of a premium all-cash offer.
Shareholders should have the opportunity to decide."
```

### Employee Concerns

```
Key Issues Raised:
- Job security in acquisition
- Minneapolis HQ future
- Management retention
- Cultural integration

Current Sentiment:
- Senior management: Opposed to deal
- Middle management: Uncertain
- Union (200 employees): Seeking assurances
```

## Exhibit 6: Legal Considerations

### Fiduciary Duties

**Delaware Law Applies:**

```
Business Judgment Rule:
- Directors presumed to act in good faith
- Must be informed
- Must act in best interest of corporation

Unocal Standard (Defensive Measures):
- Reasonable grounds to believe threat exists
- Response proportionate to threat
- Defense cannot be preclusive or coercive

Revlon Duties (If "For Sale"):
- Maximize shareholder value
- Run fair auction process
- Cannot favor one bidder unreasonably
```

### Legal Counsel Advice

```
"The board may maintain the poison pill while
evaluating the offer and alternatives. However,
the pill cannot be maintained indefinitely in the
face of a premium all-cash offer without
substantial justification.

If the board determines the company is 'for sale,'
Revlon duties apply and the board must seek to
maximize value for shareholders.

We recommend forming a special committee of
independent directors to evaluate the offer
and oversee the process."
```

## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives
This case teaches students to:
- Evaluate hostile takeover offers from target perspective
- Understand fiduciary duties and legal constraints
- Design appropriate defense strategies
- Balance stakeholder interests in contested situations

### Key Insights

**Offer Analysis:**
- $65/share is at/above trading comps (4.9x vs 4.0x)
- Below precedent transactions median (4.9x vs 4.5x on revenue, but 24.4x vs 22.0x on EBITDA)
- 30% premium is at low end for hostile deals
- With synergies, GlobalHealth could pay $75-80

**Defense Options:**
- Pill + staggered board provide time, not permanent defense
- "Just say no" only works if standalone value is credible
- White knight may emerge if genuine process run
- Revlon duties likely triggered by any engagement

**Stakeholder Considerations:**
- Institutional shareholders want fair process
- Some activists support management
- Employees have legitimate concerns
- Legal exposure if board appears entrenched

### Recommended Approach

**Phase 1 (Days 1-15): Initial Response**
```
Actions:
1. Form special committee (3 independent directors)
2. Engage independent advisors
3. Issue "evaluating" press release
4. Do NOT reject outright
5. Prepare detailed valuation analysis

Statement:
"The Board has formed a Special Committee to
carefully evaluate the proposal in the context of
MedDevice's strategic plan and all alternatives.
Shareholders need take no action at this time."
```

**Phase 2 (Days 16-60): Process**
```
Actions:
1. Complete standalone valuation
2. Approach 3-4 potential white knights
3. Consider negotiation with GlobalHealth
4. Prepare proxy defense materials
5. Regular shareholder communication

Key Question: Is Vision 2028 credible enough to decline?
```

**Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Resolution**
```
Outcomes:
A) Higher offer secured (GlobalHealth or white knight)
B) Negotiate improved GlobalHealth offer ($70-75)
C) Standalone with enhanced shareholder returns
D) Recommend GlobalHealth offer if best available

Recommended: Seek improved offer or white knight
Target Price: $72-75/share
Walk-Away: Standalone if offers below $70
```

### Valuation Summary

```
Methodology          | Value Per Share
---------------------|------------------
Current Trading      | $50
GlobalHealth Offer   | $65
Trading Comps        | $55-60
Precedent Trans      | $65-75
DCF (Management)     | $77
DCF (Conservative)   | $65-70

With Synergies:
GlobalHealth Value   | $75-85
White Knight Value   | $70-80

Conclusion: $65 is low end of fair value
Target: $72-75
Minimum: $68-70
```

### Discussion Questions

1. Does the 30% premium obligate the board to accept? What premium would?

2. How much weight should the board give to management's strategic plan versus current market value?

3. If employees would lose jobs in acquisition, how should that factor into the board's decision?

4. What if no white knight emerges and GlobalHealth won't raise its offer?

### Key Takeaways

1. **Process matters** - Fair, informed process protects board
2. **Fiduciary duties are real** - Can't "just say no" indefinitely
3. **Alternatives must be explored** - White knight, standalone
4. **Stakeholder management** - Shareholders ultimately decide
5. **Timing is strategic** - Use defensive tools to create time
6. **Documentation critical** - Record deliberations carefully
