## Exhibit 6: Activist Proposal

**Leverage Recapitalization Proposal:**
- Increase debt by $800 million
- Use proceeds for special dividend ($600M) and share buyback ($200M)
- Target D/E of approximately 0.50

**Activist Arguments:**
1. Company is under-levered vs. peers
2. Excess cash is earning low returns
3. Tax shield is being left on the table
4. Shareholder returns can be enhanced
5. Management discipline will improve

## Discussion Questions

### Question 1: Current WACC Calculation
Calculate MidWest's current WACC using market values. Is the company optimally capitalized?

### Question 2: Optimal Capital Structure
Based on the exhibits, what D/E ratio would minimize WACC? What credit rating would this imply?

### Question 3: Recapitalization Analysis
Evaluate the activist's proposal:
a) What would be the new capital structure?
b) What would be the new WACC?
c) How much value could be created or destroyed?

### Question 4: Practical Considerations
Beyond WACC, what practical factors should influence the capital structure decision?

### Question 5: Recommendation
What capital structure would you recommend? How would you implement the change?

## Analysis Framework

### Current WACC Calculation

**Step 1: Determine Component Costs**
```
Cost of equity (CAPM):
re = 4% + 0.85 × 5.5% = 8.68%

After-tax cost of debt:
rd(1-T) = 5% × 0.75 = 3.75%
```

**Step 2: Market Value Weights**
```
Equity: Market cap = $3,250M
Debt: $150M (assume market ≈ book)
Total: $3,400M

E/V = 3,250 / 3,400 = 95.6%
D/V = 150 / 3,400 = 4.4%
```

**Step 3: Calculate WACC**
```
WACC = (95.6% × 8.68%) + (4.4% × 3.75%)
WACC = 8.30% + 0.17%
WACC = 8.47%
```

**Assessment:** Current WACC is approximately 8.5%, higher than peer average of 7.7%. Company appears under-levered.

### Optimal Capital Structure Analysis

**From Exhibit 5:**
- WACC minimized at D/E of 0.40-0.60
- WACC at D/E = 0.50: ~8.4%
- Reduction from current: ~10-15 basis points

**Rating Implications:**
```
At D/E = 0.50:
Debt would be: ~$1,083M (assuming E = $2,167M)
Debt/EBITDA: 2.7x
Interest expense: ~$60M (at 5.5%)
Coverage: 300/60 = 5x

This suggests BBB+ rating, down from current A.
```

### Activist Proposal Analysis

**Pro Forma Capital Structure:**
```
Current debt: $150M
New debt: $800M
Total debt: $950M

Current equity value: $3,250M
Buyback: $200M (removes ~3.1M shares)
Special dividend: $600M (no equity impact on value)
New equity value: ~$3,050M (post-buyback)

Pro forma D/E: 950 / 3,050 = 0.31
```

Wait—this is less than activist's stated 0.50 target. Let's recalculate:

**To achieve D/E = 0.50:**
```
If E remains ~$3,000M (after buyback value effect):
D needed = $1,500M
New debt needed: $1,350M (vs. current $150M)

This would enable:
$1,200M in shareholder returns
~$500M special dividend
~$700M buyback
```

**New WACC Estimate (D/E = 0.50):**
```
From Exhibit 5, D/E = 0.50 interpolation:
βL ≈ 1.17, re ≈ 10.4%, rd ≈ 5.6%

WACC = (66.7% × 10.4%) + (33.3% × 5.6% × 0.75)
WACC = 6.93% + 1.40%
WACC = 8.33%
```

**Value Creation Estimate:**
```
Current WACC: 8.47%
New WACC: 8.33%
Reduction: 14 bps

Value impact (using perpetuity approximation):
ΔV = EBITDA × (1/WACC_new - 1/WACC_old)
ΔV ≈ $400M × (12.00 - 11.81) = $76M

Or using tax shield:
PV(Tax Shield) = T × D = 25% × $1,350M = $338M

Note: These are rough estimates; actual value impact
depends on distress costs and other factors.
```

### Practical Considerations

**Factors Favoring Higher Leverage:**
1. Stable, predictable cash flows
2. Tangible assets (collateral)
3. Tax benefits significant
4. Management discipline
5. Peer comparison suggests under-leveraged

**Factors Favoring Lower Leverage:**
1. Cyclical industry
2. Acquisition opportunities
3. Capital expenditure needs
4. Covenant restrictions
5. Management/board preferences

**MidWest-Specific:**
- Industrial equipment is moderately cyclical
- Strong cash generation historically
- No major acquisition needs mentioned
- Conservative corporate culture
- Activist pressure creates urgency

### Recommendation Framework

**Proposed Target: D/E = 0.35-0.40**

**Rationale:**
1. WACC reduction achieved
2. Maintains investment-grade rating (A-/BBB+)
3. Preserves flexibility for cycles
4. Responds to activist concerns
5. More conservative than peers but defensible

**Implementation:**
1. **Phase 1:** Issue $600M debt for $400M special dividend + $200M buyback
2. **Phase 2:** Evaluate after 12 months, potentially add $200M more debt
3. **Maintain:** $200M minimum cash buffer
4. **Covenant:** Ensure comfortable headroom at Debt/EBITDA < 2.5x

**Pro Forma at D/E = 0.35:**
```
Debt: ~$800M
Equity: ~$2,400M (after buyback)
Debt/EBITDA: 2.0x
Coverage: 6-7x
Rating: A- (maintained investment grade)
WACC: ~8.4% (vs. current 8.5%)
```

## Teaching Note

### Key Learning Points

1. **WACC isn't everything** - Practical considerations matter
2. **Trade-off theory applies** - Tax benefit vs. distress cost
3. **Industry context matters** - Cyclicality affects optimal leverage
4. **Flexibility has value** - Option to borrow later is worth something
5. **Stakeholder management** - Board, activists, agencies all have views

### Discussion Extensions

- How would a recession change the recommendation?
- What if the company had acquisition opportunities?
- How would you negotiate with the activist?
- What covenant package would you accept?

### Common Student Mistakes

- Ignoring market values for weights
- Using book D/E instead of market D/E
- Assuming linear WACC reduction with leverage
- Not considering ratings and financial flexibility
- Treating WACC optimization as sole objective
