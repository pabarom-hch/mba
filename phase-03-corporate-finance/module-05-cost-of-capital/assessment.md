## Answer Key

### Section A

**Q1:** WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) is the blended rate of return required by all capital providers (debt and equity), weighted by their market value proportions. It's important because:
- It's the discount rate for NPV calculations
- It's the hurdle rate for investment decisions
- It determines the discount rate in DCF valuation
- Projects must earn above WACC to create value

**Q2:** Debt interest is tax-deductible, creating a "tax shield" that reduces the effective cost of debt. The formula is rd × (1-T). The tax shield equals interest expense × tax rate. Equity dividends are not tax-deductible, so the full cost of equity is used.

**Q3:** CAPM: re = rf + β(rm - rf)
- rf = Risk-free rate (compensation for time value)
- β = Beta (sensitivity to market risk)
- (rm - rf) = Equity Risk Premium (compensation for bearing market risk)
- re = Cost of equity (required return by shareholders)

**Q4:**
- Levered beta reflects both business risk AND financial risk (from debt)
- Unlevered beta reflects only business (operating) risk
- Unlever when: Comparing companies with different leverage, finding pure-play beta for projects, understanding underlying business risk
- Formula: βU = βL / [1 + (1-T)(D/E)]

**Q5:** Company WACC reflects average risk of existing operations. A specific project may have different risk (higher or lower), requiring risk-adjusted discount rate. Use:
- Pure-play beta approach: Find comparable pure-play companies
- Risk premiums: Add/subtract based on relative risk
- Divisional WACC: For multi-business companies

### Section B

**Q6:**
```
After-tax rd = 7% × (1 - 0.30) = 4.9%
```

**Q7:**
```
re = rf + β × ERP
re = 3.5% + 1.25 × 6%
re = 3.5% + 7.5%
re = 11.0%
```

**Q8:**
```
E = 10M × $40 = $400M
D = $150M
V = $550M

E/V = 400/550 = 72.7%
D/V = 150/550 = 27.3%

WACC = (72.7% × 12%) + (27.3% × 6% × 0.75)
WACC = 8.72% + 1.23%
WACC = 9.95% ≈ 10.0%
```

**Q9:**
```
βU = βL / [1 + (1-T) × D/E]
βU = 1.4 / [1 + 0.75 × 0.5]
βU = 1.4 / 1.375
βU = 1.02
```

**Q10:**
```
Step 1: Unlever each comparable
X: βU = 1.2 / [1 + 0.75 × 0.4] = 1.2 / 1.30 = 0.92
Y: βU = 1.0 / [1 + 0.75 × 0.2] = 1.0 / 1.15 = 0.87
Z: βU = 1.3 / [1 + 0.75 × 0.6] = 1.3 / 1.45 = 0.90

Average βU = 0.90

Step 2: Relever to target D/E = 0.3
βL = 0.90 × [1 + 0.75 × 0.3] = 0.90 × 1.225 = 1.10

Step 3: Calculate cost of equity
re = 4% + 1.10 × 5.5% = 4% + 6.05% = 10.05%
```

**Q11:**
```
DDM: re = (D1 / P) + g
D1 = $2 × 1.04 = $2.08
re = ($2.08 / $50) + 4%
re = 4.16% + 4%
re = 8.16%
```

**Q12:**
```
Total debt = $350M

Weighted rd = (200/350 × 5%) + (100/350 × 7%) + (50/350 × 6%)
            = (57.1% × 5%) + (28.6% × 7%) + (14.3% × 6%)
            = 2.86% + 2.00% + 0.86%
            = 5.72%
```

### Section C

**Q13:**
```
a) Beta choice:
   Regression: 1.35, Industry: 1.25
   Use adjusted beta or judgment between these.
   Recommendation: 1.30 (blend, leaning toward regression but considering industry)

b) Cost of equity:
   re = 4.2% + 1.30 × 5.5% = 4.2% + 7.15% = 11.35%

c) WACC:
   E = $5B, D = $2B, V = $7B
   E/V = 71.4%, D/V = 28.6%

   WACC = (71.4% × 11.35%) + (28.6% × 6% × 0.75)
   WACC = 8.10% + 1.29%
   WACC = 9.39% ≈ 9.4%

d) For lower-risk expansion:
   - Find pure-play comparables in the target industry
   - Calculate unlevered beta of comparables
   - Relever to project capital structure
   - Calculate project-specific WACC (likely lower than 9.4%)
   - Alternatively, subtract 1-2% as risk discount
```

**Q14:**
```
a) Weighted average unlevered beta:
   βU = (50% × 0.8) + (30% × 1.2) + (20% × 1.5)
   βU = 0.40 + 0.36 + 0.30
   βU = 1.06

b) Divisional WACCs:
   First, relever each division's beta:
   D/E = 0.4, so D/V = 28.6%, E/V = 71.4%

   Consumer:
   βL = 0.8 × [1 + 0.75 × 0.4] = 0.8 × 1.30 = 1.04
   re = 4% + 1.04 × 5.5% = 9.72%
   WACC = (71.4% × 9.72%) + (28.6% × 5.5% × 0.75) = 8.12%

   Industrial:
   βL = 1.2 × 1.30 = 1.56
   re = 4% + 1.56 × 5.5% = 12.58%
   WACC = (71.4% × 12.58%) + (28.6% × 5.5% × 0.75) = 10.16%

   Financial Services:
   βL = 1.5 × 1.30 = 1.95
   re = 4% + 1.95 × 5.5% = 14.73%
   WACC = (71.4% × 14.73%) + (28.6% × 5.5% × 0.75) = 11.69%

c) Industrial project at 10% IRR:
   Divisional WACC = 10.16%
   10% < 10.16% → REJECT
   (If using company WACC of ~9.4%, would wrongly accept)
```

**Q15:**
```
a) Country risk premium:
   Default spread × 1.5 = 2.5% × 1.5 = 3.75%

b) Project WACC:
   US WACC + Country Risk Premium = 10% + 3.75% = 13.75%

c) Other factors to consider:
   - Currency risk (hedging costs)
   - Political/regulatory risk
   - Legal system differences
   - Repatriation restrictions
   - Local financing availability
   - Tax treaty implications
   - Inflation differentials
```

### Section D

**Q16:**
```
a) New WACC:
   D/E = 0.50
   D/V = 0.50 / 1.50 = 33.3%
   E/V = 1.00 / 1.50 = 66.7%

   WACC = (66.7% × 12.5%) + (33.3% × 5.5% × 0.75)
   WACC = 8.33% + 1.37%
   WACC = 9.70%

b) WACC reduction:
   Current: 9.6%
   Proposed: 9.70%
   Change: +0.1% (actually INCREASES slightly!)

c) Trade-offs:
   Pros:
   - More tax shield
   - Discipline on management

   Cons:
   - Higher cost of equity offsets tax benefit
   - Lower credit rating
   - Less financial flexibility
   - Higher bankruptcy risk
   - Potentially restrictive covenants

d) Recommendation:
   Do NOT recommend the change. WACC doesn't improve, and company loses financial flexibility and credit quality. The increased cost of equity more than offsets the tax benefit of additional debt.
```

**Q17:**
```
a) Hurdle rates (Company WACC: 9%):
   - Core maintenance: 8% (below WACC - required investments)
   - Core expansion: 10-11% (slightly above WACC for execution risk)
   - New market entry: 13-15% (significantly above for uncertainty)

b) Strategic project below hurdle:
   - Quantify strategic value (real options, market access, learning)
   - If strategic value + NPV is positive, consider approval
   - Require explicit strategic justification from business sponsor
   - CEO/Board must approve exceptions with clear rationale
   - Track outcomes to assess judgment quality

c) Governance process:
   - Tier 1 (<$5M, core business): Business unit approval at standard hurdle
   - Tier 2 ($5-25M): CFO approval with sensitivity analysis
   - Tier 3 (>$25M): Board approval with full risk assessment
   - Strategic exceptions: CEO + Board with documented strategic rationale
   - Annual review of hurdle rate appropriateness
   - Post-investment audits to learn from actual vs. projected returns
