## Answer Key

### Section A

**Q1:** Time value of money reflects that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future because:
1. Opportunity cost: Money can be invested to earn returns
2. Inflation: Purchasing power erodes over time
3. Risk: Future cash is less certain
4. Preference: People prefer current consumption

**Q2:** NPV = Present Value of Cash Inflows - Present Value of Cash Outflows.
Decision rule: Accept if NPV > 0, reject if NPV < 0.
NPV is the gold standard because it:
- Considers all cash flows
- Accounts for time value of money
- Measures absolute value creation
- Directly links to shareholder wealth

**Q3:** IRR is the discount rate that makes NPV equal zero.
Conflicts occur with:
- Mutually exclusive projects of different sizes
- Non-conventional cash flows (multiple sign changes)

Trust NPV because it measures absolute value creation and makes realistic reinvestment assumptions.

**Q4:**
- Sunk costs: Already incurred, cannot be recovered. DO NOT include—irrelevant to future decisions.
- Opportunity costs: Value of best alternative foregone. ALWAYS include—represent real economic cost.

**Q5:** Real options are opportunities for future decisions that affect investment value. Examples:
1. Option to expand: Ability to scale up if successful (value from upside capture)
2. Option to abandon: Ability to exit and recover salvage (value from limiting downside)
3. Option to delay: Wait for uncertainty to resolve (value from avoiding bad outcomes)

### Section B

**Q6:**
```
PV = FV / (1+r)^n
PV = $50,000 / (1.09)^7
PV = $50,000 / 1.8280
PV = $27,349
```

**Q7:**
```
a) NPV = -200,000 + 60,000 × PVIFA(12%, 5)
   PVIFA = [1 - (1.12)^-5] / 0.12 = 3.6048
   NPV = -200,000 + 60,000 × 3.6048
   NPV = -200,000 + 216,288 = $16,288

b) Accept—NPV is positive.
```

**Q8:**
```
Try 15%: NPV = -100 + 40/1.15 + 45/1.32 + 50/1.52
         NPV = -100 + 34.8 + 34.1 + 32.9 = $1.8K (positive)

Try 16%: NPV = -100 + 40/1.16 + 45/1.35 + 50/1.56
         NPV = -100 + 34.5 + 33.3 + 32.1 = ($0.1K) (negative)

IRR ≈ 15.9%
```

**Q9:**
```
Simple Payback:
Year 1: ($100K) remaining
Year 2: ($40K) remaining
Year 3: $30K surplus
Payback = 2 + 40/70 = 2.57 years

Discounted Payback:
Year 1 PV: $50K/1.10 = $45.5K → ($104.5K) remaining
Year 2 PV: $60K/1.21 = $49.6K → ($54.9K) remaining
Year 3 PV: $70K/1.33 = $52.6K → ($2.3K) remaining
Year 4 PV: $40K/1.46 = $27.4K → $25.1K surplus
Discounted Payback = 3 + 2.3/27.4 = 3.08 years
```

**Q10:**
```
PI(A) = ($100K + $500K) / $500K = 1.20
PI(B) = ($80K + $300K) / $300K = 1.27

Ranking by PI: B (1.27), then A (1.20)

Optimal: Fund B ($300K), then what fits from A?
Can't do partial A, but have $200K remaining.

Options:
- B only: NPV = $80K
- A only: NPV = $100K

Choose A—higher total NPV with budget constraint.
Or if divisible: B + 2/5 of A = $80K + 0.4×$100K = $120K
```

**Q11:**
```
Depreciation = $80,000 / 4 = $20,000

EBIT = Revenue - Costs - Depreciation
EBIT = $40,000 - $10,000 - $20,000 = $10,000

Tax = $10,000 × 0.25 = $2,500

Net Income = $7,500

OCF = Net Income + Depreciation
OCF = $7,500 + $20,000 = $27,500

Or using tax shield:
OCF = (40,000 - 10,000)(1-0.25) + 20,000(0.25)
OCF = $22,500 + $5,000 = $27,500 ✓
```

### Section C

**Q12:**
```
a) Annual OCF:
Depreciation = ($500,000 - $50,000) / 5 = $90,000

EBIT = $400,000 - $200,000 - $90,000 = $110,000
Tax = $110,000 × 0.25 = $27,500
Net Income = $82,500
OCF = $82,500 + $90,000 = $172,500

b) Terminal CF:
OCF Year 5: $172,500
Salvage: $50,000
Tax on salvage: $0 (sold at book value)
WC recovery: $100,000
Total: $322,500

c) NPV:
Initial: ($600,000)
Years 1-4 OCF: $172,500 × 3.1699 = $546,808
Year 5: $322,500 / 1.6105 = $200,248
NPV = -$600,000 + $546,808 + $200,248 = $147,056

d) Accept—NPV is positive ($147K)
```

**Q13:**
```
a) NPV at 10%:
Project A: -100 + 60/1.10 + 60/1.21 + 60/1.33
         = -100 + 54.5 + 49.6 + 45.1 = $49.2K

Project B: -400 + 150/1.10 + 180/1.21 + 200/1.33
         = -400 + 136.4 + 148.8 + 150.4 = $35.6K

b) IRR:
Project A ≈ 36%
Project B ≈ 17%

c) Choose A.
NPV(A) = $49.2K > NPV(B) = $35.6K
Even though IRR(B) < IRR(A), for mutually exclusive projects, choose highest NPV.
A creates more absolute value.
```

**Q14:**
```
a) Base Case:
Revenue = 50,000 × $30 = $1,500,000
Variable Costs = 50,000 × $18 = $900,000
Fixed Costs = $300,000
EBITDA = $300,000
Depreciation = $1,000,000 / 5 = $200,000
EBIT = $100,000
Tax = $25,000
Net Income = $75,000
OCF = $75,000 + $200,000 = $275,000

NPV = -1,000,000 + 275,000 × 3.7908 = $42,470

b) 40,000 units:
Revenue = $1,200,000
Variable = $720,000
Fixed = $300,000
EBITDA = $180,000
EBIT = ($20,000)
Tax benefit = $5,000
Net Income = ($15,000)
OCF = ($15,000) + $200,000 = $185,000

NPV = -1,000,000 + 185,000 × 3.7908 = ($298,702)

c) 60,000 units:
Revenue = $1,800,000
Variable = $1,080,000
Fixed = $300,000
EBITDA = $420,000
EBIT = $220,000
Tax = $55,000
Net Income = $165,000
OCF = $365,000

NPV = -1,000,000 + 365,000 × 3.7908 = $383,642

d) Break-even:
Need OCF where NPV = 0
Required OCF = $1,000,000 / 3.7908 = $263,825

(Units × $12 - $300,000)(0.75) + $200,000(0.25) = $263,825
Units × $9 - $225,000 + $50,000 = $263,825
Units × $9 = $438,825
Units = 48,758 units
```

### Section D

**Q15:**
```
a) Upfront commitment:
Expected Value = 0.4 × 0.5 × $200M = $40M
Investment = $5M + $20M + $50M = $75M
NPV = $40M - $75M = ($35M)

b) Staged approach (work backwards):
Phase 3: Invest $50M if Phase 2 succeeds
E(Value) = $200M, NPV = $200M - $50M = $150M

Phase 2: Invest $20M to get 50% chance at $150M
E(Value) = 0.5 × $150M = $75M
NPV at Phase 2 = $75M - $20M = $55M

Phase 1: Invest $5M to get 40% chance at $55M
E(Value) = 0.4 × $55M = $22M
NPV = $22M - $5M = $17M

c) Option value = $17M - (-$35M) = $52M
```

**Q16:**
```
a) PI:
Efficiency: (600 + 3,000) / 3,000 = 1.20
New Product: (1,200 + 5,000) / 5,000 = 1.24
Expansion: (800 + 4,000) / 4,000 = 1.20
IT Upgrade: (300 + 2,000) / 2,000 = 1.15
R&D: (200 + 6,000) / 6,000 = 1.03

b) PI Ranking: New Product (1.24) → Efficiency (1.20) → Expansion (1.20) → IT (1.15) → R&D (1.03)

Select: New Product ($5M) + Efficiency ($3M) + IT ($2M) = $10M
Total NPV = $1.2M + $600K + $300K = $2.1M

c) Strategic considerations:
- R&D has "Very High" strategic value but lowest PI
- New Product has "High" strategic value AND highest PI—good
- Consider: New Product ($5M) + R&D ($6M) = $11M (over budget)
- Alternative: Efficiency ($3M) + R&D ($6M) = $9M, NPV = $800K
- Recommendation: Stick with PI ranking (New Product + Efficiency + IT) unless R&D represents essential future capability
```

**Q17:**
```
a) No—the $2M is a sunk cost. It was spent regardless of the launch decision and cannot be recovered. Only future incremental cash flows matter.

b) NPV:
Investment: $5M
Cash flows: $1.5M × PVIFA(12%, 5) = $1.5M × 3.6048 = $5.407M
NPV = $5.407M - $5M = $407K

c) Recommendation: Launch the product.
NPV is positive ($407K), meaning it creates value.
The $2M in R&D is irrelevant to this decision—it's already spent.
```
