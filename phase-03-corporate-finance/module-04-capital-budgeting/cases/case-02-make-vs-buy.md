# Case Study: TechMed Make vs. Buy Decision

## Case Overview

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Company | TechMed Devices Inc. |
| Industry | Medical Device Manufacturing |
| Revenue | $450M annually |
| Situation | In-house vs. outsourced production |
| Challenge | Quantitative and strategic analysis |
| Time Limit | 45 minutes |

---

## Background

TechMed Devices is a leading manufacturer of diagnostic medical equipment. The company currently outsources the production of a critical subassembly—the sensor module—to Precision Electronics, a Taiwan-based contract manufacturer.

Recent supply chain disruptions have raised concerns about dependence on external suppliers. Additionally, a competitor recently faced a major recall due to quality issues with outsourced components. The VP of Operations has proposed bringing sensor module production in-house.

Your task: Evaluate the make vs. buy decision from both financial and strategic perspectives.

## Analysis Framework

### Incremental Cash Flow Analysis

**Step 1: Determine Outsourcing Costs**

| Year | Units | Price | Outsource Cost |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | 110,000 | $88 | $9,680,000 |
| 2 | 110,000 | $90 | $9,874,000 |
| 3 | 125,000 | $93 | $11,625,000 |
| 4 | 125,000 | $95 | $11,858,000 |
| 5 | 125,000 | $97 | $12,095,000 |
| 6 | 125,000 | $99 | $12,337,000 |
| 7 | 125,000 | $101 | $12,584,000 |
| 8 | 125,000 | $103 | $12,836,000 |

**Step 2: Determine In-House Costs**

Annual Depreciation:
```
($10,000,000 - $1,000,000) / 8 = $1,125,000
```

Opportunity Cost (Warehouse):
```
8,000 sq ft × $15 = $120,000/year
```

Year 1 (95% yield means 5% scrap):
```
Units needed: 110,000 / 0.95 = 115,789
Variable: 115,789 × $65 = $7,526,329
Fixed: $1,200,000
Opportunity: $120,000
Total Operating: $8,846,329
```

Years 2+ (99% yield):
```
Year 2: 110,000 / 0.99 = 111,111 units
Variable: 111,111 × $65 = $7,222,222
Fixed: $1,200,000
Opportunity: $120,000
Total: $8,542,222

Year 3+: 125,000 / 0.99 = 126,263 units
Variable: $8,207,071
Fixed: $1,200,000
Opportunity: $120,000
Total: $9,527,071
```

**Step 3: Calculate Incremental Savings (Outsource - In-House)**

| Year | Outsource | In-House Op | Savings |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | $9,680,000 | $8,846,329 | $833,671 |
| 2 | $9,874,000 | $8,542,222 | $1,331,778 |
| 3 | $11,625,000 | $9,527,071 | $2,097,929 |
| 4 | $11,858,000 | $9,719,612 | $2,138,388 |
| 5 | $12,095,000 | $9,916,004 | $2,178,996 |
| 6 | $12,337,000 | $10,116,324 | $2,220,676 |
| 7 | $12,584,000 | $10,320,651 | $2,263,349 |
| 8 | $12,836,000 | $10,529,064 | $2,306,936 |

**Step 4: Calculate OCF from Savings**

```
After-tax savings = Savings × (1 - 0.25) = Savings × 0.75
Depreciation tax shield = $1,125,000 × 0.25 = $281,250

Year 1 OCF:
= $833,671 × 0.75 + $281,250 = $906,503

Year 2 OCF:
= $1,331,778 × 0.75 + $281,250 = $1,280,084

Year 3 OCF:
= $2,097,929 × 0.75 + $281,250 = $1,854,697

[Continue for Years 4-8]
```

**Step 5: Initial Investment**

```
Capital: $10,000,000
Transition: $500,000
Working Capital: $1,500,000
Total: $12,000,000
```

**Step 6: Terminal Cash Flow**

```
Salvage: $1,000,000
Tax on gain: $0 (sold at book value)
WC Recovery: $1,500,000
Total: $2,500,000
```

**Step 7: NPV Calculation**

| Year | Investment | OCF | Terminal | Total CF | PV @ 10% |
|------|------------|-----|----------|----------|----------|
| 0 | ($12,000,000) | | | ($12,000,000) | ($12,000,000) |
| 1 | | $906,503 | | $906,503 | $824,094 |
| 2 | | $1,280,084 | | $1,280,084 | $1,057,920 |
| 3 | | $1,854,697 | | $1,854,697 | $1,393,466 |
| 4 | | $1,884,791 | | $1,884,791 | $1,287,377 |
| 5 | | $1,915,497 | | $1,915,497 | $1,189,557 |
| 6 | | $1,946,757 | | $1,946,757 | $1,098,963 |
| 7 | | $1,978,512 | | $1,978,512 | $1,015,214 |
| 8 | | $2,011,452 | $2,500,000 | $4,511,452 | $2,104,775 |

**NPV = ($1,028,634)**

Base case NPV is negative—continue outsourcing appears better.

### Break-Even Analysis

**At what volume does in-house become preferable?**

```
Outsource cost per unit (average): ~$95
In-house variable: $65
In-house fixed + depreciation: $1,200,000 + $1,125,000 = $2,325,000

Break-even:
$95Q = $65Q + $2,325,000
$30Q = $2,325,000
Q = 77,500 units

We're already above this—so why is NPV negative?
```

**Issue: Initial investment and working capital**

The investment payback requires sufficient years of savings. Let's find the volume where NPV = 0:

At approximately 160,000 units/year, NPV approaches zero.

### Risk-Adjusted Analysis

**Expected Cost of Outsourcing Risks:**
```
Supply disruption: 15% × $2M = $300,000/year
Quality issues: 10% × $1.5M = $150,000/year
Price surprises: 20% × $300K = $60,000/year
Total: $510,000/year expected risk cost
```

**Expected Cost of In-House Risks:**
```
Year 1 delays: 25% × $1M = $250,000 (one-time)
Cost overrun: 30% × 15% × ~$1.2M = $54,000/year
Technology obsolescence: 10% × $2M = $200,000/year
Total ongoing: $254,000/year
```

**Risk-Adjusted NPV:**
```
Add $510K - $254K = $256K annual benefit to in-house
After-tax: $192K/year

Additional PV: $192K × 5.335 = $1,024,320

Risk-adjusted NPV: ($1,028,634) + $1,024,320 = ($4,314)

Still slightly negative, but essentially break-even.
```

### Sensitivity Analysis

| Variable | Change | NPV Impact |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Outsource price +10% | | +$4.2M |
| In-house variable cost +10% | | ($2.8M) |
| Volume +20% | | +$1.1M |
| WACC 8% instead of 10% | | +$0.8M |
| Investment overrun +20% | | ($2.0M) |

**Key drivers:** Outsource price and in-house variable cost

**Flip points:**
- Outsource price increase of 8%+ → In-house preferred
- In-house variable cost decrease of 12%+ → In-house preferred
- Volume increase to 160K+ → In-house preferred

### Strategic Assessment

**Beyond the Numbers:**

| Factor | Outsource | In-House |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Quality Control | Limited | High |
| Supply Security | Low | High |
| IP Protection | Moderate risk | Protected |
| Flexibility | High | Lower |
| Capital Needs | Low | High |
| Core Competency | Focus | Dilution |
| FDA Compliance | Shared risk | Direct control |

**Strategic Value Assessment:**

If FDA requirements tighten or a competitor's outsourcing failure creates market opportunity, the strategic value could be significant:

```
Probability of strategic upside: 30%
Value if realized: $5M NPV improvement
Expected strategic value: $1.5M
```

With strategic value: NPV = ($1.0M) + $1.5M = $0.5M

### Hybrid Options

**Dual Sourcing:**
- Keep 60% with Precision Electronics
- Bring 40% in-house
- Investment: ~$6M (scaled down)
- Benefits: Risk mitigation, learning, leverage in negotiations
- NPV likely positive with lower risk

**Qualified Second Source:**
- Develop alternative supplier
- Cost: ~$500K qualification
- Maintains flexibility with risk mitigation

**Phased Approach:**
- Year 1-2: Dual source (40% in-house)
- Year 3+: Evaluate full transition
- Real option value in staging

### Recommendation

**RECOMMEND: HYBRID APPROACH (Dual Sourcing)**

**Rationale:**

1. **Financial Case:**
   - Full in-house NPV marginally negative (($1M))
   - Risk-adjusted essentially break-even
   - Hybrid likely NPV positive with lower risk

2. **Strategic Case:**
   - Reduces supply chain risk
   - Provides learning opportunity
   - Maintains negotiating leverage
   - Positions for potential full transition

3. **Implementation:**
   - Year 1: Build capability for 50,000 units
   - Investment: ~$5M (scaled)
   - Maintain Precision Electronics for 50%+
   - Evaluate expansion in Year 3

4. **Key Success Metrics:**
   - Quality: Match or exceed 99.5% yield
   - Cost: Achieve projected variable cost
   - Timeline: Full production by end of Year 1

5. **Contingency:**
   - If supply chain disruption occurs, accelerate transition
   - If costs higher than planned, reassess at Year 2
   - Build option to expand or contract

## Teaching Note

### Key Learning Points

1. **Make vs. buy is strategic** - Financial analysis is necessary but not sufficient
2. **Risk quantification** - Assign probabilities and values to risks
3. **Real options value** - Staging creates flexibility
4. **Hybrid solutions** - Pure make or buy may not be optimal
5. **Sensitivity analysis** - Know what drives the decision

### Discussion Extensions

- How would tariffs or trade policy affect this analysis?
- What if the supplier offered a long-term price lock?
- How does this decision affect the company's risk profile?
- What contract terms would you negotiate with each approach?

### Common Student Mistakes

- Treating this as purely financial decision
- Ignoring the opportunity cost of warehouse space
- Not considering transition costs and ramp-up inefficiency
- Overlooking working capital requirements
- Assuming full savings are realized immediately
