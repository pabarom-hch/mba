## Teaching Note

### Learning Objectives
This case teaches students to:
- Apply multiple valuation methodologies to a real acquisition scenario
- Understand how strategic and financial buyers value differently
- Synthesize conflicting value indications into actionable recommendations
- Consider synergies in acquisition pricing

### Key Insights

**DCF Analysis:**
- Students should calculate WACC around 10-11%
- Terminal value should represent 60-70% of EV
- Implied standalone value: $900M-$1,100M

**Trading Comps:**
- CloudSync's superior growth (25% vs 17% median) justifies premium
- 10-15% premium to median = 6.8-7.0x revenue
- Implied value: $1,100M-$1,200M on 2024 metrics

**Precedent Transactions:**
- Most relevant: DataSync Pro (similar size/growth)
- Control premium of 30% typical
- Implied value: $1,200M-$1,500M

**LBO Floor:**
- At 25% IRR and 4.5x leverage: ~$900M maximum
- This sets the competitive floor
- Strategic premium over LBO: 30-50%

**Synthesis:**
- Standalone value: $1,000M-$1,100M
- With control premium: $1,200M-$1,400M
- With synergies: Up to $1,600M
- Recommended opening bid: $1,150M
- Walk-away: $1,050M
- Maximum with synergies: $1,450M

### Discussion Questions

1. How much of the synergies should TechGiant pay away to CloudSync shareholders?

2. If Silver Oak bids $950M, how should TechGiant respond?

3. What non-price terms might affect the deal dynamics?

4. How would you adjust valuation if management projections seem aggressive?

### Model Solution Highlights

**WACC Calculation:**
```
Re = 4.5% + 1.35 × 5.5% = 11.9%
D/E = 20% (target), E/V = 83%, D/V = 17%
Rd(1-t) = 7.5% × (1-0.25) = 5.6%
WACC = 83% × 11.9% + 17% × 5.6% = 10.8%
```

**DCF Summary:**
```
PV of FCF (2025-2029): $285M
Terminal Value: $1,050M
PV of TV: $640M
Enterprise Value: $925M
Less: Debt: ($20M)
Plus: Cash: $35M
Equity Value: $940M
```

**Synergy-Adjusted Value:**
```
Standalone EV: $925M
PV of Cost Synergies: $150M
PV of Revenue Synergies: $200M
Less: Integration Costs: ($25M)
Synergy-Adjusted EV: $1,250M
```
