### Model Solution

**WACC Calculation:**
```
Beta (levered) = 1.25 × [1 + (1-0.25) × 0.25] = 1.48
Re = 4.5% + 1.48 × 6.0% = 13.4%
Rd(1-t) = 7.0% × 0.75 = 5.25%
WACC = 80% × 13.4% + 20% × 5.25% = 11.8%
(Note: Using target D/V of 20%)
```

### Discussion Questions

1. Why might growth investors accept a higher price than value investors?

2. How does the "use of proceeds" affect your valuation? Does debt paydown matter?

3. If the underwriters push for a lower price to ensure a "pop," how should management respond?

4. What milestones in the first year would justify the growth premium?

### Key Takeaways

1. **IPO valuation balances multiple constituencies** - Company wants high price; investors want returns; underwriters want successful deal

2. **Growth story must be credible** - Energy storage segment growth is key differentiator

3. **IPO discount is real** - First-time investors need compensation for risk

4. **Positioning matters** - GreenTech should be positioned as "growth" not "value"

5. **Execution risk is priced** - Margin expansion is not guaranteed

### Suggested Price Range
- **Range: $22 - $28**
- **Midpoint: $25**
- **Rationale:** Premium to precedents, modest discount to trading comps, supported by DCF at mid-range assumptions

This implies:
- Enterprise Value: ~$2.4B
- EV/2025E Revenue: 3.7x
- EV/2025E EBITDA: 23.1x
- P/E (2025E): ~45x

The valuation is aggressive but supported by growth trajectory, favorable market conditions, and sector tailwinds.
