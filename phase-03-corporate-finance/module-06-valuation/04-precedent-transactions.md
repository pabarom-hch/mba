# Precedent Transactions Analysis

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the role of precedent transactions in valuation
- Select and analyze relevant transactions
- Calculate and interpret transaction multiples
- Understand control premiums
- Apply precedent transactions appropriately

## Introduction

Precedent transactions analysis values a company based on prices paid for similar companies in M&A deals. Unlike trading comparables, transaction multiples include a control premium—the extra amount acquirers pay to gain control of a company.

This method is essential for M&A advisory, providing a market-tested indication of what buyers actually pay, not just what markets theoretically value.

## Core Concepts

### Why Precedent Transactions?

```
Trading Multiples: What minority shareholders pay
Transaction Multiples: What acquirers pay for control

Transaction > Trading because:
1. Control premium (20-40%)
2. Synergy expectations
3. Strategic value
4. Competitive bidding
```

### Control Premium

```
Control Premium = (Transaction Price / Pre-Announcement Price) - 1

Example:
Pre-announcement price: $50
Acquisition price: $65
Control Premium: (65/50) - 1 = 30%
```

**Typical Control Premiums:**

| Situation | Premium Range |
|-----------|---------------|
| Friendly deal, strategic buyer | 20-35% |
| Competitive auction | 35-50% |
| Hostile takeover | 40-60% |
| Distressed sale | 0-15% |
| Financial buyer | 15-30% |

### Transaction Multiple Calculation

```
Transaction EV = Deal Value + Assumed Debt - Cash

Transaction Multiple = Transaction EV / Metric (LTM)

Metrics:
- Transaction EV / LTM EBITDA
- Transaction EV / LTM Revenue
- Transaction EV / LTM EBIT
```

## Transaction Selection

### Selection Criteria

**Primary Criteria:**
1. Same or similar industry
2. Similar target size
3. Similar business model
4. Recent (typically last 3-5 years)
5. Arms-length transaction

**Secondary Criteria:**
- Similar strategic rationale
- Similar acquirer type
- Similar market conditions
- Similar geography

### Deal Type Considerations

| Deal Type | Characteristics | Use |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| Strategic | Synergies paid for | Highest multiples |
| Financial (PE) | Returns-focused | LBO-like multiples |
| Distressed | Fire sale conditions | Lower multiples |
| Cross-border | Market access premium | Variable |

### Time Period Selection

```
General Rule: Last 3-5 years of transactions

Consider:
- Market cycle (boom vs. bust)
- Industry changes
- Regulatory shifts
- M&A market conditions

Exclude:
- Pre-crisis deals in post-crisis analysis
- Deals during unusual periods
```

## Precedent Transaction Output

### Standard Transaction Table

| Date | Target | Acquirer | EV ($M) | Revenue | EBITDA | EV/Rev | EV/EBITDA |
|------|--------|----------|---------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Mar 24 | Target A | Buyer 1 | 1,200 | 400 | 100 | 3.0x | 12.0x |
| Nov 23 | Target B | Buyer 2 | 800 | 200 | 60 | 4.0x | 13.3x |
| Jun 23 | Target C | Buyer 3 | 2,000 | 500 | 150 | 4.0x | 13.3x |
| Jan 23 | Target D | Buyer 4 | 500 | 150 | 40 | 3.3x | 12.5x |
| Sep 22 | Target E | Buyer 5 | 1,500 | 350 | 110 | 4.3x | 13.6x |
| **Mean** | | | | | | **3.7x** | **12.9x** |
| **Median** | | | | | | **4.0x** | **13.3x** |

### Analyzing the Transactions

For each transaction, consider:

1. **Strategic rationale** - Why did buyer pay this price?
2. **Synergies** - How much was for synergy value?
3. **Process** - Was it competitive auction?
4. **Market conditions** - Bull or bear market?
5. **Form of consideration** - Cash, stock, or mixed?

## Applying Precedent Transactions

### Multiple Selection

```
Step 1: Calculate transaction multiples
Step 2: Analyze outliers and remove if needed
Step 3: Consider appropriate metric (revenue vs. EBITDA)
Step 4: Apply premium/discount for differences
Step 5: Calculate valuation range
```

### Premium/Discount Factors

| Factor | Impact on Multiple |
|--------|-------------------|
| Higher growth | + (premium) |
| Better margins | + (premium) |
| More recent deal | + if market improving |
| Strategic vs. financial buyer | + for strategic |
| Competitive auction | + (premium) |
| Size difference | Variable |

### Comparison to Trading Comps

```
Expected Relationship:
Transaction Multiple > Trading Multiple

Implied Premium = Transaction Multiple / Trading Multiple - 1

Example:
Trading EV/EBITDA: 10x
Transaction EV/EBITDA: 13x
Implied Premium: 30%

If transaction multiple < trading multiple:
- Distressed sale?
- Stale transaction data?
- Market bubble?
```

## Consulting Application

### M&A Advisory Use

**For Buy-Side:**
```
"Based on recent transactions, we expect to pay 10-12x EBITDA.
Key comp: [Similar transaction] at 11x suggests fair range."
```

**For Sell-Side:**
```
"Precedent transactions support 12-14x EBITDA.
Strategic buyers have paid 13x+ for similar assets.
We recommend opening offer at 14x."
```

### Fairness Opinion Context

```
Precedent transactions are required in fairness opinions
to show that price is within range of comparable deals.

Key considerations:
- Transaction comparability
- Time period relevance
- Market condition similarity
```

## CEO Application

### Reading Precedent Analysis

**Questions to Ask:**

1. "How similar are these transactions?"
   - Same industry? Same size?

2. "What drove the multiples?"
   - Synergies? Competition? Desperation?

3. "When did these deals happen?"
   - Different market cycle?

4. "Who were the buyers?"
   - Strategic vs. financial?

### Using Precedents in Negotiations

```
As Buyer:
"Precedent transactions average 10x. We're offering 11x,
which represents a premium to the market."

As Seller:
"Recent strategic deals have been at 13x+.
Your 10x offer significantly undervalues our company."
```

| Q4 22 | IndCo D | Strategic | $500M | $175M | $40M | 23% | 2.9x | 12.5x | Competitive |
| Q2 22 | IndCo E | PE | $350M | $125M | $30M | 24% | 2.8x | 11.7x | Platform |

**Statistics:**

| Metric | Mean | Median | High | Low |
|--------|------|--------|------|-----|
| EV/Revenue | 2.9x | 2.9x | 3.2x | 2.7x |
| EV/EBITDA | 11.8x | 11.7x | 12.5x | 11.4x |

**Target Company:**
- Revenue: $180M
- EBITDA: $45M (25% margin)
- Above-average growth: 8% vs. industry 5%

**Analysis:**

```
Base Valuation:
EV/EBITDA at median (11.7x): $45M × 11.7x = $527M
EV/Revenue at median (2.9x): $180M × 2.9x = $522M

Adjustments:
+ Higher growth (+8% vs. 5%) → 5% premium
+ Competitive process expected → 5% premium
Total adjustment: 10% premium

Adjusted Multiple: 11.7x × 1.10 = 12.9x
Implied EV: $45M × 12.9x = $581M

Valuation Range: $525M - $600M
```

**Comparison to Trading:**

```
Current trading comps: 9.5x EV/EBITDA
Precedent transactions: 11.7x (median)
Implied control premium: 23%

This is within normal range (20-35%)
```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Using Stale Transactions
**Mistake:** Including 8-year-old deals.
**Fix:** Focus on last 3-5 years; weight recent deals more.

### 2. Ignoring Deal Context
**Mistake:** Treating all transactions equally.
**Fix:** Understand strategic rationale, process, conditions.

### 3. Small Sample Size
**Mistake:** Drawing conclusions from 2 transactions.
**Fix:** Supplement with trading comps if needed.

### 4. Comparing Different Deal Types
**Mistake:** Mixing distressed sales with strategic premiums.
**Fix:** Segment by deal type or exclude outliers.

### 5. Ignoring Synergies
**Mistake:** Assuming buyer paid full synergy value.
**Fix:** Estimate portion of synergies reflected in price.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Control premium included** - Transactions > trading multiples
2. **Context matters** - Why was premium paid?
3. **Recency important** - Market conditions change
4. **Comparability essential** - Similar size, industry, situation
5. **Analyze, don't just average** - Understand each transaction
6. **Supplement trading comps** - Triangulate approaches
7. **Use for M&A pricing** - Directly relevant for deal work

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Control Premium
Stock pre-announcement: $40. Acquisition price: $52. Calculate control premium.

### Problem 2: Transaction Multiple
Deal value: $500M. Target had $50M debt and $20M cash. LTM EBITDA: $40M. Calculate transaction EV/EBITDA.

### Problem 3: Valuation
Five precedent transactions averaged 10x EV/EBITDA. Target EBITDA is $60M. Target has higher growth, justifying 15% premium. Calculate implied EV.
