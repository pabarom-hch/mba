## Answer Key

### Section 1: Conceptual Questions

**Answer 1.1 (5 points):**
Precedent transactions typically yield higher values because they include a **control premium** (worth 3 points) - the additional amount acquirers pay to gain control of a company. This premium (typically 20-40%) compensates for:
- Ability to make strategic decisions
- Synergy expectations
- Access to cash flows
- Potential for operational improvements

Trading comps reflect minority stake values where buyers have no control (worth 2 points).

**Answer 1.2 (5 points):**
Terminal value dominates because (3 points):
- Projection period is typically only 5-10 years
- Cash flows in near years are discounted less but are also smaller (growing company)
- Most value lies beyond the projection period

Risks this presents (2 points):
- High sensitivity to terminal growth rate assumptions
- Small changes in terminal assumptions significantly impact value
- Requires careful sanity checking against implied multiples

**Answer 1.3 (5 points):**
Use EV/Revenue when (2.5 points each for valid examples):
1. **High-growth/early-stage companies** with negative EBITDA (e.g., tech startups, biotech)
2. **Companies with temporarily depressed margins** undergoing turnaround
3. **Industries where revenue scale matters** more than current profitability (e.g., SaaS businesses with land-and-expand models)
4. **Companies with varying margin structures** across the peer set

**Answer 1.4 (5 points):**
MOIC (Multiple of Invested Capital) (1.5 points):
- Exit Equity Value / Initial Equity Investment
- Shows total return multiple (e.g., 2.5x means $2.50 back for every $1 invested)

IRR (Internal Rate of Return) (1.5 points):
- Annualized return rate
- Accounts for time value of money

Relationship and comparison (2 points):
- Same MOIC over different periods = different IRRs
- IRR is better for comparing investments of different holding periods
- Example: 2.0x over 3 years ≈ 26% IRR; 2.0x over 5 years ≈ 15% IRR

**Answer 1.5 (5 points):**
LBO floor (3 points):
- The maximum price a financial buyer (PE firm) can pay while achieving target returns (typically 20-25% IRR)
- Represents value without synergies, constrained by return requirements

Usefulness (2 points):
- For sellers: Establishes minimum competitive bid; ensures financial buyers can participate
- For strategic buyers: Shows price they must beat; helps justify premium with synergies

### Section 2: DCF Calculations

**Answer 2.1 (10 points):**

```
FCFF Calculation:

EBIT                          $75.0M
Less: Taxes (25%)            ($18.75M)
NOPAT                         $56.25M
Plus: Depreciation           $30.0M
Less: CapEx                  ($40.0M)
Less: Change in NWC          ($10.0M)
─────────────────────────────────────
FCFF                          $36.25M
```

Scoring:
- NOPAT calculation: 3 points
- Adding back D&A: 2 points
- Subtracting CapEx: 2 points
- Subtracting ΔNWC (as use of cash): 3 points

**Answer 2.2 (8 points):**

Terminal Value (5 points):
```
TV = FCF × (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
TV = $80M × (1.025) / (0.10 - 0.025)
TV = $82M / 0.075
TV = $1,093.3M
```

Present Value of TV (3 points):
```
PV = TV / (1 + WACC)^5
PV = $1,093.3M / (1.10)^5
PV = $1,093.3M / 1.6105
PV = $678.7M
```

**Answer 2.3 (7 points):**

a) Equity Value (2 points):
```
EV:          $800M
Less: Debt: ($150M)
Plus: Cash:  $50M
─────────────────────
Equity:     $700M
```

b) Diluted Shares - Treasury Stock Method (3 points):
```
Options: 2M shares at $15 strike
Current price: $25

Shares issued: 2M
Proceeds: 2M × $15 = $30M
Shares repurchased: $30M / $25 = 1.2M
Net dilution: 2M - 1.2M = 0.8M

Diluted shares = 40M + 0.8M = 40.8M
```

c) Share Price (2 points):
```
Price = $700M / 40.8M = $17.16 per share
```

### Section 3: Comparable Company Analysis

**Answer 3.1 (12 points):**

a) Multiple Calculations (4 points):

| Company | EV/Revenue | EV/EBITDA |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Peer A | 6.0x | 30.0x |
| Peer B | 6.0x | 30.0x |
| Peer C | 6.0x | 30.0x |
| Peer D | 6.0x | 34.3x |
| Peer E | 5.7x | 28.6x |

b) Statistics (2 points):

| Metric | Mean | Median |
|--------|------|--------|
| EV/Revenue | 5.94x | 6.0x |
| EV/EBITDA | 30.6x | 30.0x |

c) Valuation (4 points):
```
Using EV/Revenue (median 6.0x):
EV = $280M × 6.0x = $1,680M

Using EV/EBITDA (median 30.0x):
EV = $56M × 30.0x = $1,680M

Implied EV Range: ~$1,650M - $1,700M
```

d) Premium/Discount Analysis (2 points):
Target should trade at a **slight premium** because:
- Target growth (16%) is above median peer growth (~14%)
- Target margins (20% EBITDA margin) are in line with peers
- Suggest 5-10% premium → EV of $1,750M - $1,850M

**Answer 3.2 (8 points):**
Three reasons for Peer D's lower multiple (2.5 points each for any 3):

1. **Lower growth rate**: Peer D at 8% vs. Peer C at 18% growth; markets pay more for growth
2. **Lower margins**: Peer D has 17.5% EBITDA margin vs. Peer C at 20%; efficiency concerns
3. **Size discount**: Peer D is smaller ($200M revenue vs. $500M); less scale, more risk
4. **Business mix or quality differences**: Could have less recurring revenue, worse customer concentration
5. **Execution/management concerns**: May have missed estimates or have operational issues

### Section 4: Precedent Transactions

**Answer 4.1 (5 points):**

Control Premium Calculation (3 points):
```
Premium = (Acquisition Price / Pre-announcement Price) - 1
Premium = ($58 / $45) - 1
Premium = 1.289 - 1
Premium = 28.9%
```

What it represents (2 points):
- Value of control over company decisions
- Synergy expectations captured in price
- Strategic value beyond standalone trading

**Answer 4.2 (10 points):**

a) Most Relevant Transactions (4 points):
- **Alpha Inc (Q2 2024)**: Most recent, strategic buyer, auction process - directly comparable
- **Gamma Ltd (Q1 2023)**: Strategic with synergies, similar to expected situation
- **Epsilon (Q1 2022)**: Cross-border strategic, shows international interest

Less relevant:
- Beta Corp: PE buyer (different return dynamics)
- Delta Co: Distressed sale (not comparable situation)

b) Valuation Range for Strategic Buyer (4 points):
```
Relevant transaction multiples: 10.0x - 12.0x
Most applicable: 10.5x - 12.0x (excluding distressed)

Target EBITDA: $65M
Conservative: $65M × 10.5x = $683M
Aggressive: $65M × 12.0x = $780M

Recommended range: $680M - $780M
Central estimate: $730M (11.2x)

Auction process may push toward higher end.
```

c) PE Buyer Adjustment (2 points):
```
PE buyers typically pay lower multiples (return-constrained).
Beta Corp at 12.0x seems high for PE; may have had growth thesis.
More realistic PE range: 9.0x - 10.5x
PE valuation: $585M - $683M
```

### Section 5: LBO Analysis

**Answer 5.1 (10 points):**

a) Initial Equity Investment (2 points):
```
Purchase Price: $400M
Debt (5x × $50M): $250M
Equity: $400M - $250M = $150M
```

b) Exit Enterprise Value (2 points):
```
Exit EV = Exit EBITDA × Exit Multiple
Exit EV = $75M × 8.5x = $637.5M
```

c) Exit Equity Value (2 points):
```
Exit Equity = Exit EV - Exit Debt
Exit Equity = $637.5M - $100M = $537.5M
```

d) MOIC (2 points):
```
MOIC = Exit Equity / Initial Equity
MOIC = $537.5M / $150M = 3.58x
```

e) IRR (2 points):
```
IRR = (MOIC)^(1/years) - 1
IRR = (3.58)^(1/5) - 1
IRR = 1.291 - 1
IRR = 29.1%
```

**Answer 5.2 (5 points):**

Working backwards from 25% IRR requirement:
```
Required return at 25% IRR over 5 years:
Exit Equity = Entry Equity × (1.25)^5
$537.5M = Entry Equity × 3.052
Entry Equity = $537.5M / 3.052 = $176.1M

If debt remains 62.5% of purchase price (250/400):
Equity = 37.5% of purchase price
$176.1M = 37.5% × Purchase Price
Maximum Purchase Price = $176.1M / 0.375 = $469.6M

Or approximately $470M (8.5% higher than base case)
```

Alternative approach (also acceptable):
```
At 25% IRR:
Entry Equity × (1.25)^5 = Exit Equity
Entry Equity × 3.052 = $537.5M
Max Entry Equity = $176.1M

Max Purchase Price = $176.1M + $250M debt = $426M
(Assumes same absolute debt level)
```
